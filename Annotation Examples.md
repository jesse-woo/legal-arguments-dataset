Good Example:

I. Plaintiff obtained insurance based on fraud or mistatement of a material fact.

A. When Plaintiff applied for insurance for his car, his statement written to the insurance agent representing Defendant stated that he had never had his insurance cancelled or refused.

B. Prior to this, another insurance agent for the Defendant, Mr. Lilly had refused to write an insuranc policy for the Plaintiff because Plaintiff had previously had an insurance policy cancelled.

II. Plaintiff's prior insurance history was a material fact because it would have impacted Plaintiff's insurance rate or even his ability to obtain insurance.

III.Defendant timely cancelled Plaintiff's insurance upon learning that he had submitted false statements

A. Timely cancellation of the policy contradicts any claim of waiver or estoppel.

IV. In the absence of pleadings or proof of waiver or estoppel, a fraudulent or false statement of a material fact by an insurance applicant on their application is sufficient to defeat recovery of the applicant's insurance claim.

CONCLUSION:
Plaintiff's false statement that he had not previously had his insurance canceled or refused was sufficient to defeat his claim, and Defendant's motion for a directed verdict should be granted on these grounds. The lower court should be reversed.
