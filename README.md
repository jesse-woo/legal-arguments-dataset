# Data

Data was sourced from Hugging Face pile-of-law/pile-of-law/scotus_filings. We filtered out non-brief filings and briefs for writ of certiori from the validation set to obtain only substantive briefs by parties in merit cases. We use regular expressions to extract tables of contents and conclusions.
