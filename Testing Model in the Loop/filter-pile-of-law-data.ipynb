WENDELL LEWIS, ET AL.,\\nAPPELLANTS\\nv.\\nPENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION,\\nAPPELLEE\\n_______\\nAppeal from the United States District Court\\nfor the District of Columbia\\n(No. 1:15-cv-01328)\\n_______\\nBefore: HENDERSON and WALKER, Circuit Judges,\\nand GINSBURG, Senior Circuit Judge.\\nJUDGMENT\\nWe heard this appeal on the record from the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of\\nColumbia and the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 briefs and arguments. We\\nfully considered the issues and determined that a\\npublished opinion is unnecessary. See D.C. Cir. R.\\n36(d).\\nWe AFFIRM the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment.\\n\\n\\x0c2a\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nAfter Delta Air Lines went bankrupt in 2005, it\\nentered into an agreement to end its pension plan,\\nwhich terminated on September 2, 2006. At that\\npoint, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation\\n(PBGC) became the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trustee under the\\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act. The\\nPilots in this case, who retired from Delta, later\\nchallenged several decisions PBGC made.\\nThe district court dismissed one count of the\\nPilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Amended Complaint (Count VI), and it\\ngranted summary judgment to PBGC on the\\nremaining counts (Counts II-V). Lewis v. PBGC, 314\\nF. Supp. 3d 135 (D.D.C. 2018). Because we agree\\nwith that decision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s well-reasoned approach to the\\nmerits of the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims, we affirm.1\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nAs an initial matter, we disagree with the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nargument against deferring to how PBGC\\ninterprets ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ambiguous provisions.\\nIn Davis v. PBGC, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]e [saw] no reason to\\ndepart from the usual deference we give to an\\nagency interpreting its organic statute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 571 F.3d\\n1288, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Davis I). We thus\\ndeferred in Davis I \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto the PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authoritative\\nand reasonable interpretations of ambiguous\\nprovisions of ERISA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nFour years later, in a later stage of the same\\nlitigation, we declined to say \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether the PBGC is\\nentitled to [Chevron] deference . . . when it acts as\\nWe have jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1291, and our review of the\\ndistrict court is de novo. Western Surety Co. v. U.S. Engineering\\nConstruction, LLC, 955 F.3d 100, 104 (D.C. Cir. 2020).\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c3a\\nthe trustee in an involuntary retirement plan\\ntermination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis v. PBGC, 734 F.3d 1161, 1167\\n(D.C. Cir. 2013) (Davis II).\\nThe Pilots argue that Davis I isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t binding\\nbecause Davis II called it into question. But Davis\\nII meant only what it said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegardless of the\\nstandard of deference, the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims relating to\\nthe PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of the statute and\\nregulations must fail.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. In other words, even if\\nthis Court hadn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t deferred to PBGC in Davis II, the\\noutcome of Davis II would have been the same. See\\nid. And, although we decided Davis I in reviewing a\\npreliminary-injunction decision, Davis I remains\\nbinding precedent. See Mahoney v. Babbitt, 113\\nF.3d 219, 222 (D.C. Cir. 1997).\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\n*\\n\\nCount II: According to the Pilots, when PBGC\\nallocated the pension plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets, PBGC should\\nhave considered the nearly $2 billion that other\\npilots received when the pension plan terminated.\\nSee JA 125-27. But that money never became a\\npension plan asset. See id. at 883, 126 \\xc2\\xb6 77; see also\\nid. at 960. In other words, no one was entitled to\\nthat money \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the plan terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d PBGC v. LTV\\nCorp., 496 U.S. 633, 638 (1990) (citing 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7\\n1301(a)(8), 1322(a) & (b)). And ERISA requires\\nPBGC to calculate benefits based only on what\\nbeneficiaries are entitled to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the plan terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId.; see also 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe plan\\nadministrator shall allocate the assets of the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nCount III: The Pilots say that PBGC\\nmisinterpreted the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpayable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwhen it decided what benefits were \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at\\nleast five years before the pension plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n\\x0c4a\\ntermination. But Davis I expressly held that\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpayable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwas a reasonable interpretation of ambiguous text.\\n571 F.3d at 1293.\\nThat matters here because the Pilots point to an\\nincreased compensation limit on benefits that did\\nnot become payable to them until July 1, 2002. 2\\nBecause that date was not five years before the\\npension plan terminated on September 2, 2006,\\nPBGC was correct when it did not consider the\\nincreased compensation limit.\\nThe Pilots argue in their reply brief that Delta\\ndid not properly promulgate the amendment\\ncementing this July 1, 2002 date. But because the\\nPilots did not raise that argument in their opening\\nbrief to this Court, they forfeited it. World Wide\\nMinerals, Ltd. v. Republic of Kazakhstan, 296 F.3d\\n1154, 1160 (D.C. Cir. 2002).\\nCount IV: The Pilots claim PBGC illegally\\nexcluded certain benefits \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at least 5 years\\nbefore the plan terminated. JA 138-44; see 29\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3)(A).3 But those benefits did not\\nincrease the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pension checks until July 1,\\n2002. 4 To be sure, those benefits increased the\\nSee JA 399 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Earnings taken into account in determining\\nbenefit accruals of an Employee in any Plan Year beginning\\nafter June 30, 2002 shall not exceed $200,000, as adjusted for\\ncost-of-living increases in accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B)\\nof the [Internal Revenue] Code.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n3 PBGC argues that the Pilots waived their Count IV and\\nCount V(B) arguments by not raising them at the\\nadministrative level. Appellee Br. at 45-46, 53. We assume\\nwithout deciding that the Pilots did not waive these arguments\\nby failing to raise them before the PBGC Appeals Board.\\n4 JA 402 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith respect to Participants whose Annuity Starting\\nDate was before July 1, 2001, the increased 415 limit described\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c5a\\npension checks of other pilots \\xe2\\x80\\x94 i.e., pilots who\\nwere not eligible to retire by July 1, 2001. 5 But\\nthose (active) pilots are not these (retired or\\neligible-to-retire) Pilots.\\nCount V: After the pension plan terminated,\\nPBGC recovered money from Delta. PBGC defined\\nthe value of that money based on what it was worth\\non the date the plan terminated. JA 144-50. That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nless than what it was worth a month later when\\nPBGC recovered it (because a dollar today is more\\nvaluable today than it is tomorrow).\\nThe Pilots argue PBGC should not have\\ncalculated the value of the recovery based on the\\ntermination date.

As the Supreme Court has\\nexplained:\\nWhen a plan covered under Title IV\\nterminates with insufficient assets to\\nsatisfy its pension obligations to the\\nemployees, the PBGC becomes trustee of\\nthe plan, taking over the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets and\\nliabilities.

See 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(1)\\xe2\\x80\\x93(6).\\nThe first two priority categories (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPCs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), which\\nconcern benefits \\xe2\\x80\\x9cderived from the participant[s\\xe2\\x80\\x99]\\nmandatory contributions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(2), are not\\nrelevant in this case because the Plan \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever\\nrequired mandatory employee contributions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n877. Therefore, the highest priority category relevant\\nin this case is PC3, which includes benefits for pilots\\nwho were retired or eligible to retire \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas of the\\nbeginning of the [three]-year period ending on the\\ntermination date of the plan, . . . based on the\\nprovisions of the plan (as in effect during the [five]year period ending on such date) under which such\\nbenefit would be the least.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3)(A),\\n(B).\\nPC3 benefits are comprised of the following two\\ncategories:\\n(A) in the case of the benefit of a participant\\nor beneficiary which was in pay status\\nas of the beginning of the [three]-year\\nperiod ending on the termination date of\\nthe plan, to each such benefit, based on\\nthe provisions of the plan (as in effect\\nduring the [five]-year period ending on\\nsuch date) under which such benefit\\nwould be the least, [and]\\n\\n\\x0c13a\\n(B) in the case of a participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or\\nbeneficiary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit (other than a\\nbenefit described in subparagraph (A))\\nwhich would have been in pay status as\\nof the beginning of such [three]-year\\nperiod if the participant had retired\\nprior to the beginning of the [three]-year\\nperiod and if his benefits had\\ncommenced (in the normal form of\\nannuity under the plan) as of the\\nbeginning of such period, to each such\\nbenefit based on the provisions of the\\nplan (as in effect during the [five]-year\\nperiod ending on such date) under\\nwhich such benefit would be the least.\\nFor purposes of subparagraph (A), the\\nlowest benefit in pay status during a\\n[three]-year period shall be considered the\\nbenefit in pay status for such period.\\nId. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3)(A)\\xe2\\x80\\x93(B). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese provisions exclude\\ncertain benefits from [PC3] based on whether (1)\\nthey were in pay status (i.e., actually being paid) or\\ncould have been in pay status (if an individual had\\nretired) within three years of the date of the plan\\ntermination and (2) the provisions of the plan\\ncreating them were \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect\\xe2\\x80\\x99 within the five-year\\nperiod prior to plan termination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis v.

See id. \\xc2\\xa7\\n\\n\\x0c14a\\n1344(b)(4)(A) (defining PC5(a) benefits as those\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder the plan as in effect at the beginning of the\\n[five]-year period ending on the date of plan\\ntermination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The second subcategory, PC5(b),\\nconstitutes all other vested benefits that went into\\neffect on a later date, which cannot be funded unless\\nall benefits in PC5(a) are funded, see id. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1344(b)(4)(B) (stating that PC5(b) benefits \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall be\\ndetermined\\xe2\\x80\\x9d only \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f the assets available for\\nallocation under [PC5(a)] are sufficient to satisfy in\\nfull th[ose] benefits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n3. Recovery Benefits\\nBenefits that are neither funded by the\\nterminated plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets nor guaranteed by the\\nCorporation may be funded, to the extent possible,\\nby funds recovered by the Corporation from a plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncontributing sponsor.

When the\\nCorporation recovers unfunded benefit liabilities, see\\n29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(b)(1)(A), it is required to share a\\nportion of those recoveries under the priority\\nallocation scheme set forth in \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a), see id. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1322(c).

The\\nrelevant facts regarding the Plan and the\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions taken with respect to the Plan\\nare set forth below.\\n1. The Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Compensation Limit\\nOn June 21, 2001, two weeks after the EGTRRA\\nwas passed, see Pub. L. No. 107-16, \\xc2\\xa7 611(c)(1), 115\\nStat. at 38, Delta and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpilots in the service of\\nDelta[,] . . . as represented by the Air Line Pilots\\nAssociation, International\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cALPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), signed the\\nPilots Working Agreement (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPWA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), a collective\\nbargaining agreement that updated the Plan, see AR\\n3411\\xe2\\x80\\x93 12. The PWA provides that any statutory\\nincrease to the compensation limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be effective\\nfor the . . . [Plan] as of the earliest date that the\\nincreased [q]ualified [p]lan [l]imits could have\\nbecome legally effective for that Plan, had that Plan\\nnot been collectively bargained,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 3697, and that\\nthe provision \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be effective on September 1,\\n2001,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 3695.\\nOn June 27, 2003, Delta signed the Fourth\\nAmendment to the Delta Pilots Retirement Plan As\\nAmended and Restated Effective July 1, 1996 (the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFourth Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). See AR 244, 251. The Fourth\\n\\n\\x0c17a\\nAmendment, which states that it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[e]ffective July\\n1, 2002, or such other effective date as may be\\nprovided in a provision below,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d explains that its\\npurpose is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto reflect certain provisions of . . . [the]\\nEGTRRA,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis intended as good faith\\ncompliance with the requirements of [the] EGTRRA\\nand is to be construed in accordance with [the]\\nEGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 244.\\nTo that end, the Fourth Amendment adds the\\nfollowing paragraph to the Plan:\\nThe Earnings taken into account in\\ndetermining benefit accruals of an Employee\\nin any Plan Year beginning after June 30,\\n2002 shall not exceed $200,000 . . . In\\ndetermining benefit accruals of [retired\\ne]mployees . . . in Plan Years beginning after\\nJune 30, 2002, the annual compensation\\nlimit provided in this paragraph for Plan\\nYears beginning before July 1, 2002 shall be\\n$200,000, or, if greater, the annual\\ncompensation limit in effect under Section\\n401(a)(17) of the Code for that Plan\\nYear . . . .\\nAR 245.\\n2. The Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Qualified Benefit Limit\\nThe PWA provision governing the qualified\\nbenefit limit also governs the compensation limit,\\nand states that any statutory increase to the\\nqualified benefit limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be effective for the . . .\\n[Plan] as of the earliest date that the increased\\n[q]ualified [p]lan [l]imits could have become legally\\neffective for that Plan, had that Plan not been\\ncollectively bargained,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 3697, and that the\\n\\n\\x0c18a\\nprovision \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill be effective on September 1, 2001,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAR 3695.\\nThe Fourth Amendment amended the Plan to\\nincorporate the EGTRRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increase in the qualified\\nbenefit limit as follows:\\nBenefit increases resulting from the increase\\nin the limit of Section 415(b) of the [Tax]\\nCode under [the] EGTRRA shall be provided\\nto all current and former participants (with\\nbenefits limited by Section 415(b)) who have\\nan accrued benefit under the Plan\\nimmediately prior to July 1, 2001 (other than\\nan accrued benefit resulting from a benefit\\nincrease solely as a result of the increases in\\nlimitations under Section 415)); provided,\\nhowever, that such increase shall only be\\napplied to the annuity payments made from\\nthis Plan to former participants on or after\\nJuly 1, 2002.\\nAR 248.

Bankruptcy Proceedings and Letter of\\nAgreement #51\\nIn September 2005, Delta filed for Chapter 11\\nbankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court\\nfor the Southern District of New York (the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBankruptcy Court\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). AR 6. Thereafter, the\\nCorporation determined that the Plan had\\ninsufficient assets to cover its guaranteed benefit\\nliabilities as of the proposed date of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination. AR 7. In the course of the bankruptcy\\nproceedings, Delta negotiated with the ALPA\\nregarding the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination and the benefits\\nthat non-retired Delta pilots (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cActive Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d )\\nwould receive, which resulted in the execution of\\nLetter of Agreement #51. See AR 932. Upon approval\\nby the Bankruptcy Court, Letter of Agreement #51\\nwould modify the PWA by requiring Delta to issue\\n$650 million in senior unsecured notes to the ALPA\\n(the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cALPA Notes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]n the event the . . . Plan is\\nterminated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 968, for the ALPA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distribution\\namong its members, see AR 971 (noting that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[d]istribution mechanics, eligibility and allocation\\n[of the ALPA Notes] among such pilots or pilot\\naccounts [would] be determined by [the] ALPA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nLetter of Agreement #51 also provided the ALPA\\nwith a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgeneral non-priority unsecured claim . . . in\\nthe amount of $2.1 billion (the \\xe2\\x80\\x98ALPA Claim\\xe2\\x80\\x99),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n967, to be allocated among the Active Pilots by the\\nALPA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Delta Master Executive Council, see AR\\n966\\xe2\\x80\\x9367.\\nThe Corporation objected to Delta\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for\\nthe Bankruptcy Court to authorize the execution of\\nLetter of Agreement #51 on the grounds that the\\nagreement would violate the ERISA. See AR 1050.\\nThe Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objections were based on its\\n\\n\\x0c20a\\nposition that the ALPA Notes and the ALPA Claim\\n(collectively, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cALPA Payments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) were intended\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cto replace unfunded benefits under the Pilots Plan\\nby using the proceeds to fund follow-on retirement\\nplans and other payments or distributions to pilots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAR 1049. The Corporation argued that the ALPA\\nNotes were intended to serve as replacement\\npayments for Plan benefits because Letter of\\nAgreement #51 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprovides to the [A]ctive [P]ilots $650\\nmillion in notes if and only if the Pilots Plan\\nterminates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 1064, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ALPA claim is\\nclearly intended to make up for some portion of the\\n[A]ctive [P]ilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 pension benefits lost as a result of\\nthe Pilots Plan termination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because Letter of\\nAgreement #51 permits the proceeds of the ALPA\\nClaim (as well as the ALPA Notes) to be received \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas\\nretirement benefits\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., on a pre-tax and taxdeferred basis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 1068.\\nThe Corporation objected to the execution of\\nLetter of Agreement #51 because the ALPA\\nPayments would violate the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s explicit\\nstatutory provision assigning the claim for a pension\\nplan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s total underfunding exclusively to [the] PBGC,\\nand . . . [would] establish[] a follow-on arrangement\\nto replace benefits under the Pilots Plan that may be\\nabusive of the pension insurance system.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 1049\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n50. The Corporation explained in its objections that\\nthe total amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits\\nthat it can pay to beneficiaries \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdepends on the\\namount [it] recovers for unfunded benefit liabilities\\nfrom the plan sponsor and its controlled group.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n1053. And, if Letter of Agreement #51 were executed,\\nthe Active Pilots \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould recover [u]nfunded\\n[n]onguaranteed [b]enefits from both the employer,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nin the form of the ALPA Payments, and from the\\nCorporation once it became Plan trustee upon the\\n\\n\\x0c21a\\nPlan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, which would constitute an\\nimproper double recovery that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould be distributed\\ncontrary to the [ERISA] statutory scheme.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 1064.\\nThe\\nBankruptcy\\nCourt\\noverruled\\nthe\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objections to Letter of Agreement #51,\\nfinding no \\xe2\\x80\\x9csufficient basis . . . to reach the\\nconclusion that [Letter of Agreement #51] infringes\\nany provision of law or any legal ruling by a Court,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAR 453, and authorized Delta and the ALPA to\\nexecute Letter of Agreement #51, see AR 1091,\\n1093. The Corporation initially noted an appeal of\\nthe Bankruptcy Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling, see AR 1099\\xe2\\x80\\x931102,\\nbut subsequently dismissed that appeal, AR 1153,\\nafter entering into a settlement agreement with\\nDelta, AR 1105. In that settlement agreement, the\\nCorporation received a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprepetition, general, nonpriority unsecured claim against Delta . . . in the\\namount of $2.2 billion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 1105; see also AR 1126,\\n1130.\\n4. The\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nAllocations\\nBenefit Determinations\\n\\nand\\n\\nIn December 2006, Delta and the Corporation\\nexecuted an agreement appointing the Corporation\\nas the Plan trustee and terminating the Plan as of\\nSeptember 2, 2006. See AR 5436\\xe2\\x80\\x93 38. The\\nCorporation\\nvalued\\nthe\\nPlan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nassets\\nat\\napproximately $1.984 billion and its liabilities at\\napproximately $4.552 billion. See AR 848, 877. The\\nCorporation also allocated the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplan liabilities by\\npriority category\\xe2\\x80\\x9d pursuant to the ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory\\nscheme. See AR 877; see also 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a).\\nThe\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nallocations\\nand\\nbenefit\\ndeterminations that are the subject of the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nclaims in this case are explained in further detail\\nbelow.\\n\\n\\x0c22a\\na. The Increased Compensation Limit\\nThe Corporation determined that the increased\\ncompensation limit established by the EGTRRA in\\n2001, which was incorporated into the Plan through\\nthe PWA in 2001 and the Fourth Amendment in\\n2003, see AR 15, did not apply to its calculations of\\nthe plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PC3 benefits because the increased\\ncompensation limit did not go into effect until the\\nplan year beginning on July 1, 2002, see AR 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9314\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince the plan year for the Pilots Plan began on\\nJuly 1 and ended on June 30, [the] $200,000 limit\\nwent into effect on July 1, 2002 (i.e., the first day of\\nthe plan year beginning after December 31, 2001).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d),\\nand the Plan terminated less than five years later,\\non September 2, 2006, see AR 2. Accordingly,\\nbecause the ERISA requires a benefit to be in effect\\nfor five years prior to the date of the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination in order to qualify as a PC3 benefit, see\\n29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3), the Corporation determined\\nthat the increased compensation limit did not apply\\nto its calculations of the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PC3 benefits, see\\nAR 16 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]he benefit amount in PC3 is based on the\\nplan provisions \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect\\xe2\\x80\\x99 during the five years\\nbefore the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination date \\xe2\\x80\\x98under which such\\nbenefit would be the least.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1344(a)(3))).\\nb. The Increased Qualified Benefit Limit\\nThe Corporation also determined that although\\nthe PWA incorporated the EGTRRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s increased\\nqualified benefit limit into the Plan on July 1, 2001,\\nmore than five years prior to the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination,\\nthe PWA did so only for pilots who were active at\\nthat time, i.e., pilots \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwho had not retired or\\nseparated from service prior to . . . July 1, 2001.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n22. However, for participants who retired before\\n\\n\\x0c23a\\nJuly 1, 2001, the Plan was not amended to\\nincorporate the qualified benefit limit increase until\\nthe adoption of the Fourth Amendment in June\\n2003, which was less than five years prior to the\\nPlan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination. See AR 29\\xe2\\x80\\x9330. As a result, the\\nCorporation applied the increased qualified benefit\\nlimit only for its calculations of the Active Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nPC3 benefits, and not for the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PC3\\nbenefits. See AR 30.\\nc. The Recovery Benefits\\nThe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPBGC determined that the total value of its\\nrecoveries [from Delta] under the settlement was\\n$1,279,506,423 as of May 3, 2007 (approximately\\n[eight] months after [the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination]).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n42. But, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]o reflect interest, [the] PBGC discounted\\nth[at] value . . . by $50,501,683, resulting in a\\xc2\\xa7 . . .\\nrecovery value of $1,229,004,740.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 43. The\\nCorporation allocated $240,263,310 to the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nassets, which \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificantly increased the funded\\nPC3 benefits that [the] PBGC pa[id] to PC3-eligible\\nparticipants and beneficiaries . . . , which include[d]\\nthe [plaintiffs],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and allocated $988,741,430 to its\\nunfunded benefit liabilities funds. AR 46.\\nFor the unfunded benefit liabilities funds, the\\nCorporation calculated the recovery ratio, i.e., \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\npercentage of the [P]lan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s otherwise unfunded\\nbenefits that bec[a]me funded due to [the]\\n[unfunded benefit liabilities] recovery,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was\\n38.51%. AR 47. The Corporation then multiplied the\\nvalue of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfunded benefit liabilities, as of\\nthe date of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, by the recovery\\nratio to arrive at a total figure of $681,259,882,\\nwhich was used \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto pay otherwise unfunded\\nnonguaranteed benefits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See AR 47. That amount\\nfunded the remainder of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC3 benefit\\n\\n\\x0c24a\\nliabilities, see AR 49 n.137, and almost 52% of the\\nPC5(a) benefit liabilities, see AR 50. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]here were\\nno remaining funds to allocate to [ ] PC5(b).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 50.\\nThe Corporation determined that the increased\\ncompensation and qualified benefit limits, which it\\nhad already determined could not be applied to the\\nplaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PC3 benefits, belonged in the PC5(b)\\ncategory because those increases were not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nfor the full five-year period prior to the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination, as required for inclusion in PC5(a). See\\nAR 48. Consequently, because there were no\\nremaining funds to allocate to PC5(b), the\\nCorporation was unable to pay these increases. See\\nAR 48.\\n5. The Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Decision\\nAfter the Corporation issued final benefit\\ndeterminations for the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participants and\\nbeneficiaries, see AR 2, the plaintiffs filed a\\nconsolidated appeal with the PBGC Appeals Board\\nraising thirteen issues, see AR 1, 3. On September\\n27, 2013, the Appeals Board issued its final agency\\ndecision. See AR 1. The Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusions\\nthat are relevant to the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims in this case\\nare set forth below.\\na. The ALPA Payments\\nThe plaintiffs argued before the Appeals Board\\nthat the Corporation should have taken into account\\nthe ALPA Payments that the Active Pilots received\\npursuant to Letter of Agreement #51 by construing\\nthose payments as received pension benefits under\\nthe Plan. See AR 35\\xe2\\x80\\x9336, 40\\xe2\\x80\\x9341. The Appeals Board\\ndisagreed, reasoning that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he ALPA Payments\\nwere not made from Plan assets and, thus, they were\\nnever funds that \\xe2\\x80\\x98[left] the Plan just before [the]\\n\\n\\x0c25a\\nPBGC assumed its role as statutory trustee.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 36\\n(second alteration in original) (citation omitted).\\nTherefore, the Appeals Board concluded that the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPBGC [wa]s not required to take the ALPA\\nPayments into account in allocating the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets\\nand [the] PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recoveries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 36. As justification\\nfor its position, the Appeals Board explained:\\n[The] ERISA does not require [the] PBGC to\\naccount for the ALPA Payments for purposes\\nof allocating the Pilots Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets and\\n[the] PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recoveries to the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit\\nliabilities. [29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)] provides that\\n[the] PBGC, upon plan termination, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall\\nallocate the assets of the plan (available to\\nprovide benefits) among the participants and\\nbeneficiaries of the plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d [29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1322(c)] provides for [the] PBGC to allocate a\\nportion of its recoveries under [29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1362] to benefit liabilities that are neither\\nfunded by plan assets nor guaranteed by\\n[the] PBGC. The ALPA Payments were never\\nPlan assets, nor were they funds that [the]\\nPBGC recovered under Title IV of [the]\\nERISA.\\n. . . Rather, the ALPA Payments are funds\\nthat were transferred directly from Delta to\\n[the] ALPA pursuant to a court-approved\\ncollective\\nbargaining\\nagreement.\\nFurthermore, the ALPA Payments did not\\nchange the pension liabilities owed by the\\nPilots Plan to its participants and\\nbeneficiaries as of the Pilots Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination date.\\nAR 41 (footnotes omitted); see also AR 41 n.116\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe mere fact that a participant received a\\n\\n\\x0c26a\\npayment from a source outside of a PBGC-trusteed\\nplan does not establish that a pension liability under\\nthe terminated plan has been reduced or\\nextinguished.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nb. The Increased Compensation Limit\\nThe plaintiffs argued before the Appeals Board\\nthat the Corporation should have applied the\\nincreased compensation limit in its calculations of\\ntheir PC3 benefits because it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas incorporated into\\nthe Pilots Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provisions more than [five] years\\nbefore the Pilots Plan terminated (i.e., before\\nSeptember 2, 2001).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 12\\xe2\\x80\\x9313. The Appeals Board\\ndisagreed, stating that the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation\\nprovides that a plan provision is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under 29\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3)(A) \\xe2\\x80\\x9con the later of the date on\\nwhich it is adopted or the date it becomes effective,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n29 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 4044.13(b)(6) (2017), and it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecomes\\neffective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the date that it becomes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpayable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d see\\nid. \\xc2\\xa7 4044.13(b)(3)(i); see also AR 16. And, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]enefit\\nincreases that were [in] effect[] throughout the\\n[five]-year period\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are included in PC3. See AR 17\\n(quoting 29 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 4044.13(a)). Therefore, the\\nAppeals Board explained, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca benefit increase cannot\\nbe \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for purposes of PC3 before the date on\\nwhich the increase becomes operative[,] . . . even if\\nthe plan provision that provided for the increase has\\nan earlier \\xe2\\x80\\x98stated\\xe2\\x80\\x99 effective date.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 16. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThus, if a\\nbenefit increase does not go into effect (i.e., is not\\npayable) until after [five years before the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination] and if a participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s payable PC3\\nbenefit amount would be lower based on the plan\\nprovisions that were in effect before the increase,\\nthen the increase is not included in the participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nPC3 benefit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 17.\\n\\n\\x0c27a\\nThe Appeals Board concluded that the\\nCorporation correctly applied its regulation to the\\nPlan as follows: (1) the adoption date of the Plan\\nprovision incorporating the increased compensation\\nlimit was June 21, 2001, the date the PWA was\\nsigned, see AR 245; see also AR 3412, 3697; (2) the\\nPWA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stated effective date for the increased\\ncompensation limit was September 1, 2001, see AR\\n3695, 3697; and (3) the increased compensation limit\\nbecame payable on July 1, 2002, because the Plan\\nincorporated the $200,000 limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor purposes of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98determining benefit accruals of an [e]mployee in any\\n[p]lan [y]ear beginning after June 30, 2002,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 17\\n(quoting AR 245). Therefore, the Appeals Board\\naffirmed that the increased compensation limit was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on July 1, 2002, because that was the date\\nwhen any increase in benefits would become\\npayable. See AR 17. And, because that date occurred\\nafter five years before the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, those\\nincreased benefits could not be included in PC3. See\\nAR 17. The Appeals Board noted that another\\nmember of this Court had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupheld [the] PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninterpretation of [the] ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC3 provisions as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98permissible construction of the statute,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 18\\n(citing Davis v. PBGC, 864 F. Supp. 2d 148, 157\\n(D.D.C. 2012)), which the Circuit subsequently\\naffirmed after the Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision was\\nissued, see Davis II, 734 F.3d at 1168 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nstatutory phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect\\xe2\\x80\\x99 . . . is ambiguous, and the\\nPBGC has interpreted it . . . to mean \\xe2\\x80\\x98payable.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThus, the Appeals Board affirmed the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconclusion that the increased compensation limit\\nshould not be applied to the calculations of the\\nplaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 PC3 benefits. See AR 18.\\n\\n\\x0c28a\\nc. The Increased Qualified Benefit Limit\\nThe plaintiffs further argued before the\\nAppeals Board that, although the Corporation\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrectly determined\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the PWA constituted a\\nPlan amendment that was adopted and effective\\nfive years prior to the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, the\\nCorporation erred in concluding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the increased\\n[qualified benefit] limit under the PWA applied \\xe2\\x80\\x98only\\nfor those pilots who were active at the time the [ ]\\nPWA was signed.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 28 (citation omitted). The\\nAppeals Board disagreed, stating that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbased on\\n[the] ERISA, [the] PBGC regulations, and the Pilots\\nPlan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provisions, [ ] [the] PBGC applied the\\nappropriate [qualified benefit] limits when it\\ndetermined PC3 benefits for the [plaintiffs] and for\\nthe [A]ctive [P]ilots.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 23.\\nThe Appeals Board reasoned that the PWA did\\nnot amend the Plan for retired pilots because the\\nPWA: (1) is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe basic collective\\nbargaining agreement between Delta Air Lines, Inc.\\nand the air line pilots in the service of Delta Air\\nLines, Inc.[,] as represented by the Air Lines Pilots\\nAssociation International,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 28; (2) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstates that it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98cover[s] the pilots in the employ of the Company,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAR 28 (alteration in original); and (3) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefines \\xe2\\x80\\x98Pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x98an employee of Delta Air Lines, Inc. whose name\\nappears on the Delta Air Lines Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 System\\nSeniority List,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 28. The Appeals Board noted\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe law does not presume that a collective\\nbargaining agreement covers retired employees,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR\\n29 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the contrary, the Supreme Court has found\\nthat, \\xe2\\x80\\x98[s]ince retirees are not members of the\\nbargaining unit, the bargaining agent is under no\\nstatutory duty to represent them in negotiations\\nwith the employer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting Allied Chem. & Alkali\\n\\n\\x0c29a\\nWorkers of Am. v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., 404\\nU.S. 157, 181 n.20 (1971))), and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfound insufficient\\nevidence to establish that [the] ALPA was\\nrepresenting the interests of retired pilots when it\\nnegotiated [the] PWA,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 29.\\nThe Appeals Board pointed to the Fourth\\nAmendment as further support for its conclusion\\nthat the PWA did not apply to retired pilots. See AR\\n29. It concluded that, under the Fourth Amendment,\\nthe qualified benefit limit increases were effective\\nfor Active Pilots as of July 1, 2001, but were not\\neffective for retired pilots until July 1, 2002, see AR\\n25, because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Fourth Amendment provides that\\nbenefit increases resulting from [the] EGTRRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\namendment of the [qualified benefit] limit are\\neffective on different dates depending on the\\nemployee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Annuity Starting Date (\\xe2\\x80\\x98ASD\\xe2\\x80\\x99),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 25\\nn.69. The Plan defines an employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ASD as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nfirst day of the first period for which a retirement\\nbenefit is paid as an annuity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and therefore,\\naccording to the Appeals Board, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca pilot\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ASD is on\\nor after his or her retirement date.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 25 n.69.\\nBecause the Fourth Amendment provides that the\\nqualified benefit limit increases \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere effective July\\n1, 2001 for employees with ASDs \\xe2\\x80\\x98on or after July 1,\\n2001,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i.e., for Active Pilots, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand were effective on\\nJuly 1, 2002 for employees with ASDs \\xe2\\x80\\x98before July 1,\\n2001,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i.e., for retired pilots, AR 25 n.69, the\\nAppeals Board found that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Fourth Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nestablishment of different effective dates for the two\\ngroups of participants is significant with respect to\\nthe Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resolution of [PC3 benefits],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 25\\xe2\\x80\\x9326.\\nAs the Appeals Board recognized, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he Fourth\\nAmendment explicitly provides for different effective\\ndates for the [qualified benefit] limit increase\\ndepending upon the ASD,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and therefore, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis wholly\\n\\n\\x0c30a\\nconsistent with the PWA only if . . . the PWA does\\nnot amend the [qualified] benefit limit for retired\\npilots,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[o]therwise, there would be a clear\\nconflict between the \\xe2\\x80\\x98earliest effective date\\xe2\\x80\\x99 language\\nin the PWA and the delayed effective date for the\\nretired pilots in the Fourth Amendment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 29.\\nBased on these reasons, the Appeals Board\\nconcluded that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPBGC correctly determined that\\nthe retired pilots are not entitled to have their PC3\\nbenefits computed based on the [increased qualified\\nbenefit] limit under [the] EGTRRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFourth Amendment, which provided the [qualified\\nbenefit] limit increase to the retired pilots, was\\nadopted on June 27, 2003,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and provided that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nretired pilots could not receive payments based on\\nthe increased [qualified benefit] limit . . . until July\\n1, 2002.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 30. Due to the fact that both of these\\ndates were less than five years before the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination, AR 30, the Appeals Board found that,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[f]or the retired pilots, the plan provision that\\nprovides the lowest annuity benefit payable during\\nthe five-year period before [the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nas required by Corporation regulation, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis the\\nbenefit provision in effect between September 1,\\n2001[,] and June 30, 2002.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 30.\\nd. The Recovery Funds\\nThe plaintiffs argued before the Appeals Board\\nthat the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPBGC made an error of \\xe2\\x80\\x98simple arithmetic\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nwhen it allocated the funds it recovered from Delta\\nand related entities after Plan termination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 42.\\nThe Appeals Board found no error, explaining that\\nthe Corporation properly discounted the value of its\\nrecovery as of May 3, 2007, which was\\n$1,279,506,423, by $50,501,683, to reflect the value\\n\\n\\x0c31a\\nof its recovery as of the date of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntermination.

First, the two cases\\nthe plaintiffs cite in support of their position do not\\nactually state that the doctrine of stare decisis does\\nnot apply to a decision resolving a motion for a\\npreliminary injunction. In Petroleum Jobbers, the\\npetitioner filed, among other motions, a motion for a\\nstay to enjoin proceedings pending before the\\nFederal Power Commission. See 259 F.2d at 923.\\nThe Circuit declined to grant the petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion,\\nand twice noted that its rulings were \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]ithout\\nprejudice to a contrary showing at the time the court\\n[were to] hear[] th[e] case on the merits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 925;\\nsee also id. at 926 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAgain, without prejudice to a\\nlater contrary showing by [the] respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). But\\nnowhere in its opinion did the Circuit state that the\\nprinciples of stare decisis would not apply to its\\ndecision. See generally id. Likewise, in Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Org. for\\nWomen, the Circuit in a per curiam opinion affirmed\\nthe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s issuance of a preliminary\\ninjunction barring the release of certain documents\\npursuant to a FOIA request. See 736 F.2d at 728. In\\na concurring opinion, Judge Robinson stated that he\\nwould have preferred to\\nremand the appealed phases of these cases to\\nthe District Court with instructions to\\nremand in turn to [the agency] the question\\nof release of information exempt under FOIA\\nbut unaffected by the Trade Secrets Act. [He]\\nwould further instruct the court to afford\\n[the agency] an opportunity to revise its factfinding procedures in such manner as it may\\ndesire. [He] would affirm the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrulings in all other respects, and let the\\npreliminary injunction remain in force\\nsubject to the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s further order. This\\ndisposition of these appeals, of course, would\\n\\n\\x0c46a\\nleave the parties at liberty to litigate the\\nmerits fully, free of any preclusion or\\nlimitation by the determinations leading to\\nthat injunction.\\nId. at 744 (emphasis added) (Robinson, J.,\\nconcurring). In a footnote, Judge Robinson noted\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he decision of a trial or appellate court\\nwhether to grant or deny a preliminary injunction\\ndoes not constitute the law of the case for the\\npurposes of further proceedings and does not limit or\\npreclude the parties from litigating the merits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 744 n.154 (emphasis added) (quoting Berrigan v.\\nSigler, 499 F.2d 514, 518 (1974)). Therefore,\\nPetroleum Jobbers and Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Org. for Women stand\\nfor the proposition that the Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rulings\\nregarding motions for a preliminary injunction or to\\nstay proceedings in a case do not constitute the law\\nof the case, nor do they preclude the parties from\\nlitigating the merits of the issue in future\\nproceedings in that case. See Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Org. for Women,\\n736 F.2d at 744 & n.4; Petroleum Jobbers, 259 F.2d\\nat 925. They do not, however, stand for the position\\nthat the Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rulings on such motions have no\\nprecedential value or stare decisis impact. See Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\nOrg. for Women, 736 F.2d at 744 & n.4; Petroleum\\nJobbers, 259 F.2d at 925.\\nIndeed, the Circuit has clearly distinguished\\nbetween the doctrines of law of the case or\\npreclusion and stare decisis. In Mahoney v.\\nBabbitt, 113 F.3d 219 (D.C. Cir. 1997), the Circuit\\ndeclined to vacate its prior order issuing an\\ninjunction pending the resolution of an appeal on\\nthe grounds of mootness, see id. at 220. The Circuit\\nstated:\\n\\n\\x0c47a\\nWhile it is generally accepted that a mooted\\njudgment should not preclude the litigants in\\nfuture litigation, preclusion is not the same\\nthing as stare decisis, and it is not selfevident that the precedential effects of a\\nmooted judgment should be any less\\npersuasive than if the mooting events had\\nnot occurred. Preclusion is normally based on\\na decision as to the controversy between the\\nlitigating parties. Precedent ordinarily is not.\\nPrecedent, more often than not, is drawn\\nfrom cases not involving either of the parties\\nfor or against whom the precedent is offered.\\nAs one commentator has pointed out, there is\\nno particular reason to assume that a\\ndecision, later mooted, is any less valid as\\nprecedent than any other opinion of a court.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSo long as the court believed that it was\\ndeciding a live controversy, its opinion was\\nforged and tested in the same crucible as all\\nopinions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 222 (emphasis added) (quoting 13A Wright &\\nMiller, Federal Practice & Procedure \\xc2\\xa7 3533.10 (2d\\ned. 1984)). Applying these principles to the case at\\nbar, although the Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling in Davis I\\nregarding Chevron deference did not preclude the\\nparties in that case from further litigating that\\nissue in subsequent proceedings, nor did it\\npreclude a subsequent panel from declining to\\ndecide that issue upon review of the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision on the merits, the Davis I ruling\\nregarding Chevron deference still has precedential\\nvalue.\\nSecond, even if the Davis I opinion were not\\nbinding on this Court, which obviously it is, the\\n\\n\\x0c48a\\nCourt would still reach the same conclusion\\nregarding the standard of review applicable here as\\nthe Circuit did in that case. The Circuit decided in\\nDavis I that Chevron deference is applicable to the\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asset allocation determinations\\nundertaken as trustee because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe PBGC has\\nunique experience and \\xe2\\x80\\x98practical agency expertise\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nin interpreting [the] ERISA. The PBGC is therefore\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98better equipped\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to interpret [the] ERISA than\\ncourts, and it is for this reason [this Court will also]\\ndefer to the PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authoritative and reasonable\\ninterpretations of ambiguous provisions of [the]\\nERISA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 571 F.3d at 1293 (quoting LTV Corp., 496\\nU.S. at 651).9\\nThe Court notes that even though a trustee that is not the\\nCorporation would not receive Chevron deference, that does\\nnot necessarily mean that such a trustee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusions would\\nbe reviewed de novo. As the Circuit has explained,\\n9\\n\\n[i]n Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Bruch, 489 U.S.\\n101, 115 (1989), the Supreme Court held that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca\\ndenial of benefits challenged under [29 U.S.C.] \\xc2\\xa7\\n1132(a)(1)(B) is to be reviewed under a de novo\\nstandard unless the benefit plan gives the\\nadministrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to\\ndetermine eligibility for benefits or to construe the\\nterms of the plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In this latter category of cases, the\\nstandard of review\\xe2\\x80\\x94variously described by the Court\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9carbitrary and capricious\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabuse of discretion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nreview\\xe2\\x80\\x94is plainly deferential.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWagener v. SBC Pension Benefit Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x94Non Bargained Prgm.,\\n407 F.3d 395, 402 (D.C. Cir. 2005). In other words, the level of\\ndeference a plan trustee is afforded depends on the terms of the\\nplan, see id., and is not, as the plaintiffs argue, necessarily\\nalways de novo, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 12; see also Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 17\\nn.6. The plaintiffs do not raise any argument regarding the\\nlevel of discretion that the Plan affords a trustee in its briefing\\nbefore this Court, see generally Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem.; Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply, nor did\\nthey do so in their appeal below, see generally AR 560\\xe2\\x80\\x93617, and\\n\\n\\x0c49a\\nThe plaintiffs also argue that the fact that the\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asset allocation determinations were\\nmade in its capacity as trustee\\nis especially relevant here, as [the p]laintiffs\\nhave plausibly alleged that, rather than in\\nthe detached environment of a regulator, the\\nCorporation, in its capacity as trustee,\\nengaged in various conduct that resulted in\\nthe\\nCorporation\\nearn[ing]\\nmassive\\ninvestment returns off of assets that should\\nhave been timely allocated to the plaintiffs.\\nPls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9314 (second alteration in original)\\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see\\nalso Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 14 (same). Although it may be true\\nthat any assets that the Corporation retained\\ninstead of allocating to the plaintiffs could yield a\\nreturn to the Corporation, that is true in every case\\nin which the Corporation is appointed as trustee. See\\nPiech v. PBGC, 744 F.2d 156, 161 (D.C.

And because the plaintiffs do not\\nprovide any specific evidence of self-interested bias\\nor misconduct that influenced the benefits\\ndeterminations about which they disagree, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nMem. at 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9314,10 the Court finds that the plaintiffs\\nhave not plausibly alleged any misconduct by the\\ntherefore, the Court need not consider this issue, see Nuclear\\nEnergy Inst., Inc. v.

According to\\nthe plaintiffs, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe absence of formal procedures\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98weighs against the application of Chevron\\ndeference,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 9 (quoting Fogo de Chao,\\n769 F.3d at 1137), and therefore, the Court should\\nexamine the factors that the Supreme Court set\\nforth in Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212 (2002), in\\nassessing whether the Chevron framework applies,\\nspecifically: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interstitial nature of the legal\\nquestion, the related expertise of the [a]gency, the\\nimportance of the question to administration of the\\nstatute, the complexity of that administration, and\\nthe careful consideration the [a]gency has given the\\nquestion over a long period of time,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Barnhart, 535\\nU.S. at 222.\\nIn Fogo de Chao, the Circuit declined for the\\nfollowing reasons to apply the Chevron framework to\\na decision by the Department of Homeland Security\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nAdministrative Appeals Office denying a L-1B visa\\nto one of the restaurant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s churrasqueiro chefs. See\\n769 F.3d at 1130, 1135\\xe2\\x80\\x9337. First, the Circuit\\nconcluded that the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x9clargely\\nparrot[ed], rather than interpret[ed], the key\\nstatutory language,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and thus merited no deference.\\nId. at 1136. Second, the Department \\xe2\\x80\\x9copenly\\nconceded at oral argument\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that the Appeals Office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nruling was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnon-precedential,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that, as a result,\\n\\n\\x0c51a\\nits \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterpretation of the statutory language\\xe2\\x80\\x9d did not\\nmerit Chevron deference. See id. Therefore, the\\nCircuit concluded that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe expressly nonprecedential nature of the Appeals Office\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision\\nconclusively confirm[ed] that the Department was\\nnot exercising through the Appeals Office any\\nauthority it had to make rules carrying the force of\\nlaw.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1137. Third, the decision \\xe2\\x80\\x9cw[as] the\\nproduct of informal adjudication within the [United\\nStates Citizenship and Immigration] Service[s],\\nrather than a formal adjudication or notice-andcomment rulemaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 1136, nor was it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarked by the qualities that might justify Chevron\\ndeference in the absence of a formal adjudication or\\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 1137.\\nThe Court finds that Fogo de Chao does not\\ncompel the conclusion that the Chevron framework\\ndoes not apply here because the three bases for the\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusion in Fogo de Chao simply do not\\napply to the circumstances in this case. First, the\\nplaintiffs do not argue that any Corporation\\nregulation merely parroted the ERISA statute, see\\ngenerally Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem.; Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply, and therefore, the\\nfirst basis for the ruling in Fogo de Chao is\\ninapposite, see 769 F.3d at 1136. Second, unlike the\\nDepartment in Fogo de Chao, see id., the\\nCorporation has not conceded here that its decision\\nis not precedential, see generally Def.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mem.; Def.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nReply, and therefore, would merit no Chevron\\ndeference on that basis. Third, unlike the\\nDepartment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision in Fogo de Chao, the Court\\nconcludes that the Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision here,\\nalthough also an informal adjudication, was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarked by the qualities that might justify Chevron\\ndeference in the absence of a formal adjudication or\\n\\n\\x0c52a\\nnotice-and-comment rulemaking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See 769 F.3d at\\n1137 (citing Barnhart, 535 U.S. at 222).\\nMoreover, applying the Barnhart factors, the\\nCourt is convinced that the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision\\nhere merits Chevron deference. Again, in Barnhart,\\nthe Supreme Court set forth five factors for courts to\\nconsider in determining whether an agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action\\nmerits Chevron deference: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe interstitial nature of\\nthe legal question, the related expertise of the\\n[a]gency, the importance of the question to\\nadministration of the statute, the complexity of that\\nadministration, and the careful consideration the\\n[a]gency has given the question over a long period of\\ntime.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 535 U.S. at 222. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThere is no denying the\\ncomplexity of the statutory regime under which the\\n[Corporation]\\noperates,\\nthe\\n[Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s]\\nexpertise[,] or the careful craft of the scheme it\\ndevised to reconcile various statutory provisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMylan Labs., Inc. v. Thompson, 389 F.3d 1272, 1280\\n(D.C. Cir. 2004); see also Tilley, 490 U.S. at 726\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFor a court to attempt to answer these questions\\nwithout the views of the agenc[y] responsible for\\nenforcing [the] ERISA, would be to \\xe2\\x80\\x98embar[k] upon a\\nvoyage without a compass.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (second alteration in\\noriginal) (quoting Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin,\\n444 U.S. 555, 568 (1980))). And the administrative\\nrecord in this case makes clear that the Corporation\\nand its Appeals Board carefully considered several\\ncomplex questions regarding the administration of a\\ncomplex, 178-page Plan, see AR 114\\xe2\\x80\\x93292, in\\naccordance with both the statute and the\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own regulations. The Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision is a seventy-nine-page, single-spaced\\ndocument, see AR 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9379, which resolved thirteen\\ndiscrete and complex issues raised in an appeal that\\ninvolved a record \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsist[ing] of more than 2,000\\n\\n\\x0c53a\\ntotal pages,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 3. In short, the thorough nature of\\nthe Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision clearly supports the\\nposition that the Chevron framework applies, and\\nindeed, courts have afforded the Corporation\\nChevron deference for statutory interpretations far\\nless exhaustive. See, e.g., Quality Auto. Servs., LLC\\nv. PBGC, 960 F. Supp. 2d 211, 217, 221 (D.D.C.\\n2013) (concluding that the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory\\ninterpretation of the ERISA in its \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo-page\\ndetermination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepresent[ed] a reasonable reading\\nof the statute\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nLastly, the two cases that the plaintiffs cite as\\nsupport for their proposition that the Chevron\\nframework does not apply, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 14\\n(first citing Sun Capital Partners III v. New\\nEngland Teamsters & Trucking Indus. Pension\\nFund, 724 F.3d 129, 140 (1st Cir. 2013); then citing\\nGCIU\\xe2\\x80\\x93Emp\\xe2\\x80\\x99r Ret. Fund v. Quad/Graphics, Inc., 250\\nF.

The Corporation was not a party to the litigation,\\nbut filed an amicus brief in support of the defendant.\\nSee id. at 133. The Corporation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cha[d] not adopted\\nregulations defining or explaining the meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nthe statutory terms at issue, and \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he only\\n\\n\\x0c54a\\nguidance [the First Circuit] ha[d] from the PBGC\\n[wa]s a 2007 appeals letter, defended in its amicus\\nbrief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 139. In its amicus brief, the Corporation\\ndid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot assert that its 2007 letter [wa]s entitled to\\ndeference under Chevron,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclaim[ed]\\nentitlement to deference under Auer v. Robbins, 519\\nU.S. 452 (1997).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 140. The First Circuit\\ndisagreed that Auer deference was warranted\\nbecause, under Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham\\nCorp., \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch deference is inappropriate where\\nsignificant monetary liability would be imposed on a\\nparty for conduct that took place at a time when that\\nparty lacked fair notice of the interpretation at\\nissue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. (citing 567 U.S. 142, 156 (2012)). Further,\\nthe First Circuit determined that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceven if\\nChristopher was not an impediment to Auer\\ndeference, the anti-parroting principle would be . . .\\n[, and t]he PBGC[\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] regulations ma[d]e no effort to\\ndefine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the statutory terms at issue.

The U.S.\\nAirways pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 plan terminated on March 31, 2003,\\nsee id. at 1166, and therefore, to be included in PC3,\\nthe benefit had to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before March 31,\\n1998, five years prior to the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, see\\n29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3).

See 734\\nF.3d at 1168.

See AR 3697 (stating\\nthat if the qualified benefit limit is increased, that\\nincrease is effective as of the earliest date it could\\nhave become legally effective in the absence of a\\ncollective bargaining agreement). The Fourth\\nAmendment, on the other hand, explicitly\\ndistinguishes between employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cannuity starting\\ndates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i.e., their dates of retirement. See AR 248.\\nSpecifically, the Fourth Amendment states that the\\nincreased qualified benefit limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall be effective\\nbeginning with the [plan] year starting on July 1,\\n2001[,] for those Employees whose Annuity Starting\\nDate is on or after July 1, 2001,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]ith respect\\nto Participants whose Annuity Starting Date was\\nbefore July 1, 2001, the increased [qualified benefit]\\n\\n\\x0c77a\\nlimit . . . shall be effective for annuity payments\\nmade on or after July 1, 2002.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 248. Because the\\nCorporation reviewed both provisions, and declined\\nto interpret the PWA provision as covering pilots\\nwho retired before July 1, 2001, as doing so would\\ndirectly conflict with the Fourth Amendment, the\\nCourt is satisfied that the agency \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexamine[d] the\\nrelevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory\\nexplanation for its action including a \\xe2\\x80\\x98rational\\nconnection between the facts found and the choice\\nmade.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (quoting\\nBurlington Truck Lines, 371 U.S. at 168).

See id. at 40.\\nUpon review of the statute, the Court concludes\\nthat the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to value its recoveries\\nas of the date of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination passes\\nmuster under the clear and convincing standard. 29\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1362, which establishes the liability of an\\nemployer upon the termination of a single-employer\\nplan, has two categories of liability: liability to the\\nCorporation, see id. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(b), and liability to the \\xc2\\xa7\\n1342 trustee, see id. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(c). The first category, the\\nliability to the Corporation, is described as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe total\\namount of the unfunded benefit liabilities (as of the\\ntermination date) to all participants and\\nbeneficiaries under the plan, together with interest\\n(at a reasonable rate) calculated from the\\ntermination date in accordance with regulations\\nprescribed by the [C]orporation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(b)(1)(A)\\n(emphasis added). The second category, the liability\\nto the \\xc2\\xa7 1342 trustee, which in this case is also the\\nCorporation, is described, in relevant part, as\\nthe sum of the shortfall amortization\\ncharge . . . with respect to the plan (if any)\\nfor the plan year in which the termination\\ndate occurs, plus the aggregate total of\\nshortfall amortization installments (if any)\\ndetermined for succeeding plan years . . . and\\n[ ] the sum of the waiver amortization\\ncharge . . . with respect to the plan (if any)\\n\\n\\x0c83a\\nfor the plan year in which the termination\\ndate occurs, plus the aggregate total of\\nwaiver amortization installments (if any)\\ndetermined for succeeding plan years . . . ,\\ntogether with interest (at a reasonable rate)\\ncalculated from the termination date in\\naccordance with regulations prescribed by\\nthe [C]orporation.\\nId. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(c) (emphasis added). Returning to the\\nrecovery ratio, the numerator is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nvalue of the recoveries of the [C]orporation under\\nsection 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection\\nwith such plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 1322(c)(3)(C)(i). Because the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crecoveries . . . under section 1362,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id., the section\\nrelevant in this case, are both defined in terms of\\ntheir value as of the date of the Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination,\\nsee id. \\xc2\\xa7 1362(b)(1)(A), (c), the Court concludes that\\nthe Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination to adjust the\\nrecovery value to reflect its value as of the date of\\nthe Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination is reasonable. Although the\\nplaintiffs are correct that Congress did not explicitly\\nstate that the numerator of the recovery ratio should\\nbe valued as of the date of a plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination, as it\\ndid with the denominator, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 36,\\nCongress did define the components of the\\nnumerator of the recovery ratio in terms of their\\nvalue as of the date of a plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination in other\\nprovisions of the statute. Thus, the Corporation\\nreasonably construed these statutory provisions\\ntogether to determine that the numerator of the\\nrecovery ratio must be calculated as of the date of a\\nplan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination.

The Court concludes that it is.\\nAs the Appeals Board noted, it chose to interpret\\nthe words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the PC5(a) provision the\\nsame way it interprets the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nPC3 provision given the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory\\nstructure regarding the benefits that [the] PBGC\\npays.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 51. It noted that the statute that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablishes the PC5 subcategories[] is similar to\\n[the] ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PC3 and phase-in limit provisions\\nbecause the provisions each contain a [five]-year\\nlook-back period based upon when a plan provision\\nor amendment is \\xe2\\x80\\x98effective\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d AR 51.\\nAlthough the plaintiffs are correct that the statutory\\nprovisions in \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3) and \\xc2\\xa7 1344(b)(4)(A) are not\\nidentical, it still remains that Congress chose not to\\ndefine the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under either provision,\\nand it used the same five-year period under both\\n\\n\\x0c89a\\nprovisions. See 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)(3), (b)(4)(A). So,\\neven assuming the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interpretation is\\nplausible, the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to apply the\\nsame definition of the words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to both the\\nPC3 and PC5(a) provisions is entirely reasonable.\\nSee PBGC v.

The Court\\nfinds that the plaintiffs have failed to establish any\\narbitrary, capricious, or unlawful agency action\\nbased on the administrative record that was properly\\nbefore the Corporation at the time it rendered its\\ndecision, and thus it must enter summary judgment\\nin favor of the Corporation on Claims Two through\\nFour.

Finally, the Court must\\ndismiss Claim Six, the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 APA claim, because\\nit is duplicative of the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims brought\\npursuant to the ERISA. Accordingly, the Court will\\ndeny the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 motion for summary judgment\\nand grant the Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for summary\\njudgment.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe benefits of the Active Pilots that the Corporation placed\\nahead of [the p]laintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 benefits do not satisfy the\\nCorporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x98operative\\xe2\\x80\\x99 definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x98in effect.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at\\n40 (citing Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 39).

If the Court were to grant\\nthe petition, however, the question should be restated\\nas follows:\\nWhen an underfunded pension plan that is covered by Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income\\nSecurity Act of 1974 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) terminates, Respondent Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\")\\nmust pay benefits up to the statutory limit, regardless\\nof the level of plan assets. PBGC determines those\\nbenefits according to ERISA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complex provisions\\ngoverning the guarantee and the allocation of plan\\nassets and recoveries. If a participant is dissatisfied\\nwith PBGC\\'s initial determination of his or her statutory benefit, the participant may file an appeal with\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Appeals Board (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), an independent adjudicatory body within the agency. See 29\\nC.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 4003.1, 4003.2, 4003.55, 4003.58. The\\nAppeals Board will then reach a decision after considering PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s file and all material submitted by the\\nparticipant and any third parties.\\n29 C.F.R.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 4003.59. The Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision constitutes\\nthe final agency action, after which the participant\\nmay seek judicial review of PBGC\\'s determination.\\nId.\\nWas the court of appeals correct in applying\\ndeference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretations of ambiguous\\nprovisions in Title IV of ERISA regarding the allocation of assets and recoveries in determining participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 statutory benefits?\\n\\n\\x0cii\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nCOUNTERSTATEMENT OF QUESTION\\nPRESENTED .............................................................. i\\nOPPOSITION TO PETITION FOR A WRIT\\nOF CERTIORARI ........................................................1\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE ....................................2\\nA.

The Pilots argue that PBGC\\nis not entitled to deference because it is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinherently\\nconflicted,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and purposely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincorrectly \\xe2\\x80\\x98interpret[s]\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe statute in order to \\xe2\\x80\\x9chold trusteed assets longer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand keep the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestment interest it earns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 12. In an effort to support this wild theory, the Pilots\\nargue that PBGC was acting in the capacity as a statutory trustee of their pension plan (rather than as\\ngovernment guarantor) when it performed a portion\\nof the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 benefit determinations. But as the\\ncourts below found, the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theory of an elaborate\\nscheme by PBGC is entirely groundless. And as the\\nagency that implements and administers Title IV of\\nERISA, PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory interpretations are entitled\\nto deference \\xe2\\x80\\x93 regardless of its capacity when\\nperforming a particular step in the determination of\\na participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Title IV program benefit.\\nThe D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision does not conflict\\nwith this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedents and merely applies well-\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n\\nestablished principles of deference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretations of Title IV.1 Accordingly, there is no\\nimportant question of federal law for this Court to\\nsettle. And the fact that the District of Columbia is\\nthe only jurisdiction for a suit against PBGC by\\nparticipants in a terminated plan provides no independent basis for granting certiorari.\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\nA. Statutory and Factual Background\\nThis case involves the pension benefits owed to\\na group of about 1,700 retired Delta Airlines pilots\\nand their estates under the federal pension insurance\\nprogram administered by PBGC under Title IV of\\nERISA, 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 1301-1461 (2018).

Pet. at 1-2, 20. They say that\\nPBGC employees are so \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[p]erennially worried about\\n[the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] resources\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that they used PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngoverning statute as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpowerful tool\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to generate\\nextra \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestment interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cown operational coffers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 1, 2. As the district court\\nfound, there is no evidence whatsoever of any such\\nscheme, and no explanation of what would cause\\nentire teams of government employees to create a\\ncomplex arrangement to enrich the federal coffers.\\nPet. App. at 49a-50a. Moreover, 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(c)\\nprovides that PBGC must suffer all losses in the value\\nof plan assets that occur after plan termination \\xe2\\x80\\x93 not\\njust benefit from any gains \\xe2\\x80\\x93 while PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future\\npayment obligations are absolute. Thus, retaining a\\nparticular plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets longer may not inure to the\\nagency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial self-interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 20.\\nThe Pilots nevertheless cite this purported\\nimproper motive as grounds for the courts to ignore\\nbedrock principles of judicial review and delve into\\nthe intricacies of statutory benefits under Title IV.\\nThis Court has repeatedly refused to do that, and the\\ndistrict and circuit courts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 similar refusal is\\ncompletely consistent with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedents.\\n\\n\\x0c9\\n\\nA. The Courts Below Correctly Applied\\nChevron Deference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Interpretation of ERISA in its Benefit\\nDetermination.\\nIt is well established that PBGC is entitled to\\ndeference under Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural\\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984),\\nwhen it interprets its governing statute, Title IV of\\nERISA. The Court has so held repeatedly, most\\nrecently in Beck v. Pace International Union, 551 U.S.\\n96, 104 (2007). In Beck, the Court unanimously\\ndeferred to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation:\\nWe have traditionally deferred to the PBGC\\nwhen interpreting ERISA, for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto attempt to\\nanswer these questions without the views of\\nthe agencies responsible for enforcing ERISA,\\nwould be to embar[k] upon a voyage without\\na compass.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d * * * In reviewing the judgment\\nbelow, we thus must examine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether the\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy is based upon a permissible\\nconstruction of the statute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n551 U.S. at 104. The Beck Court cited two other landmark PBGC deference cases: PBGC v. LTV Corp., 496\\nU.S. 633 (1990), and Mead Corp. v. Tilley, 490 U.S.\\n714 (1989). In LTV, the Court upheld PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of Title IV, issued during informal adjudication, finding that PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s construction was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cassuredly\\na permissible one\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under Chevron. 496 U.S. at 651\\n(citation omitted). And in Tilley, the Court applied\\nChevron to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation of 29 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 1344(a)\\xe2\\x80\\x94the same asset-allocation provision at\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n\\nissue in claims in this case. 490 U.S. at 722, 726.\\nAccordingly, the Court has already rejected the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nargument that PBGC is so \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinherently conflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\napplying this provision that deference cannot apply.\\nPet. at 1.\\nThe Pilots nevertheless argue that deference\\ncannot apply in this case because PBGC does not have\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdelegated authority\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within the meaning of United\\nStates v. Mead Corp. to allocate terminated plans\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nassets. Pet. at 14-15; 533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001).\\nThey claim that they sued PBGC in its \\xe2\\x80\\x9crole as trustee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a terminated pension plan, and ask for de novo\\nreview of certain portions of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit determinations\\xe2\\x80\\x94those the agency purportedly made in a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfiduciary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d capacity. Pet. at 3, 15-16. But PBGC is\\nnot a fiduciary when determining statutory pension\\nbenefits (including those payable when allocating\\nassets), nor could it be.\\nTitle IV explicitly limits the fiduciary duties\\nthat apply to the statutory trustee of a terminated\\nplan. The statute provides that such a trustee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall\\nbe, with respect to the plan, a fiduciary within the\\nmeaning of [Title I of ERISA] . . . except to the extent\\nthat the provisions of [Title IV] are inconsistent with\\nthe requirements applicable under [Title I] . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1342(d)(3) (emphasis added).2 Congress\\nrecognized that implementing the asset allocations\\nand benefit limitations required by the statute could\\nTitle I of ERISA contains a similar limitation on PBGC having\\nfiduciary responsibilities when allocating assets under section\\n1344. See 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1104(a)(1) (\"Subject to sections 1103(c) and\\n(d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his\\nduties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (Emphasis added).\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c11\\n\\nnot be a fiduciary act performed with an \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceye single\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nto the interests of participants, see Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d 263, 271 (2d Cir. 1982), and correspondingly limited the applicable fiduciary duties.3\\nMoreover, Congress assuredly did delegate to\\nPBGC the authority to determine Title IV pension\\nbenefits, and determining those benefits\\xe2\\x80\\x94including\\nthe asset-allocation process\\xe2\\x80\\x94constitutes an exercise\\nof that authority. Title IV benefits are a creature of\\nstatute, and ERISA expressly provides that PBGC\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guarantee and pay them (whether or not it was\\nalso the statutory trustee). 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 1322(a),\\n1361. When PBGC interprets ERISA in determining\\nthose benefit amounts, it does so as the federal agency\\nadministering the Title IV program, even if it is also\\nserving as statutory trustee, which it invariably is.\\x03\\nBut even if, hypothetically, PBGC were not the statutory trustee of a terminated plan, its interpretation of\\nthe statutory provisions would apply and would\\nwarrant deference.\\nContrary to the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 theory, PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit\\ndetermination process cannot be neatly divided into\\nportions, with some performed by PBGC as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguarantor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and receiving deference, and some performed by\\nPBGC as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrustee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and receiving de novo review.

The issue there\\nwas whether the attorney-client privilege applies to communications between government officials and their lawyers in trust\\nmatters relating to Native American tribes. Jicarilla in no way\\nalters the law about deference to an agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretations of\\nits governing statute.\\x03\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n\\nthe statute is part and parcel of the determination of\\na participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Title IV program benefit.\\nIn arguing to the contrary, the Pilots focus on\\nthe statute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s provision of allocation authority to the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cplan administrator.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 15. But there is no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplan\\nadministrator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a terminated, underfunded plan;\\nPBGC performs that function as the statutory trustee. As the statutory trustee of virtually every terminated underfunded plan, PBGC must interpret Title\\nIV, including the asset-allocation provisions. See\\n29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1344(a); 29 C.F.R. part 4044, subpart A.\\nThus, although the Pilots assert that PBGC is \\xe2\\x80\\x9con\\nequal footing with all other trustees of terminated\\nplans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for purposes of deference (Pet. at 15), there are\\nno other such trustees. As the D.C.

LTV Corp.,\\n496 U.S. at 651.

This is particularly so where the Pilots\\nsubmitted a 50-page brief with 42 exhibits to the\\nAppeals Board, and the Board considered over 5,000\\npages of materials and issued the final agency action\\nthat is binding on both the agency and the Pilots.5\\nThe Pilots recite a list of grounds that purportedly justify de novo review. They complain that the\\ncourt below did not analyze the five factors the Court\\ndiscussed in Barnhart v. Walton, 535 U.S. 212, 222\\n(2002), although they discuss only three of those\\nfactors themselves. Pet. at 17-18. Tellingly, they\\nleave out the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterstitial nature of the legal question,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe complexity of [the] administration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nthe statute, both of which weigh heavily in favor of\\ndeference. Pet. at 17-20.6 Instead, the Pilots create\\ntheir own five-part \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproper analysis,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and conclude\\nthat the Appeals Board decision \\xe2\\x80\\x9cflunks.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 17,\\n18. This is assuredly not the case, even if the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ntest did apply.\\nFirst, the Pilots claim that deference applies\\nonly when the agency has exercised authority to make\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crules carrying the force of law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 17, quoting\\n\\x03\\nThe Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 submissions to the Appeals Board are found in the\\nadministrative record (filed in the district court) at No. 15-cv01328-RBW (D.D.C.)

The legal questions are important and complex, as\\nshown by the comprehensive administrative record.\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c15\\n\\npart of a sentence in Mead. But Mead\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very next sentence makes clear that an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to engage\\nin adjudication\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94like PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x94constitutes precisely\\nthe delegated authority that Mead requires:\\nWe hold that administrative implementation\\nof a particular statutory provision qualifies\\nfor Chevron deference when it appears that\\nCongress delegated authority to the agency\\ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of\\nlaw, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise\\nof that authority. Delegation of such authority may be shown in a variety of\\nways, as by an agency\\'s power to engage\\nin adjudication or notice-and-comment\\nrulemaking, or by some other indication of a\\ncomparable congressional intent.\\n533 U.S. at 226-27 (emphasis added).\\nAs the Court reiterated in City of Arlington v.\\nFCC, a general conferral of adjudicative authority,\\nand an exercise of that authority within the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsubstantive field, is entirely sufficient to support\\nChevron deference. 569 U.S. 290, 306 (2013). What\\nJustice Scalia described in City of Arlington is\\nprecisely the case here: PBGC has general adjudicative authority to carry out \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he purposes of [Title IV\\nof ERISA],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d including the payment of statutory benefits. 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1302(a); 29 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1322(a) (PBGC\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the\\npayment of all nonforfeitable benefits . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); 29 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 1361 (PBGC \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall pay benefits under a singleemployer plan terminated under this subchapter\\nsubject to the limitations and requirements of subtitle\\n\\n\\x0c16\\n\\nB of this subchapter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). PBGC exercised that authority within its substantive field in determining the\\nPilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 entitlement to those statutory benefits. Thus,\\nChevron deference applies to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory interpretations in reaching that determination.\\nAccordingly, the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assertion that PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndetermination does not \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccarry the force of law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Pet.\\nat 17, 18) is specious. PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Appeals Board is an\\nindependent adjudicatory body within the agency\\nthat reviews initial determinations made by the\\nagency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operating units. See 29 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 4003.1,\\n4003.2, 4003.55, 4003.58.

Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000).\\nBut PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s final determination of the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 statutory pension benefits is nothing akin to that. And\\ncourts certainly have applied deference in cases\\nwhere the determination is not binding on other parties.9\\nThe Pilots next observe that PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination was not issued by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chead of the [agency]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or\\nthe agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Board of Directors. Pet. at 19. This is\\nhardly surprising, since PBGC has an independent\\nadjudicatory body that is specifically authorized to\\ncomplete this determination, and has done so for\\ndecades. But the Pilots say that this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefeats any\\nargument by PBGC invoking \\xe2\\x80\\x98the related expertise of\\nthe agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98the importance of the question to\\nadministration of the statute,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d showing instead that\\nthe decision is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnecessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x98[in]significant.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at\\n19. To the contrary, the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s painstaking final\\ndetermination of the statutory benefits of over 1,700\\nparticipants is important, significant, and worthy of\\ndeference. And PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nearly fifty years of expertise\\nin this complex area cannot be disputed.\\nThe Pilots then assert that PBGC could not\\nhave employed careful consideration over a long\\nperiod of time in determining the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 benefits\\nbecause this was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfact-bound, one-off decision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet.\\nat 19. Again, this is not so. In addressing part of the\\nPilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 appeal, the Appeals Board \\xe2\\x80\\x9capplied its prior\\nprecedent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from a 2009 appeal by a different group of\\n\\x03\\nSee, e.g., Texas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826 (5th Cir. 2020); North\\nCarolina v. FERC, 913 F.3d 148 (D.C. Cir. 2019); Fredericks v.\\nU.S. Dep\\xe2\\x80\\x99t of Interior, No. 20-2458, 2021 WL 2778575, at *10-17\\n(D.D.C. Jul. 2, 2021); Vanderkam, 943 F. Supp. 2d at 145.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0c18\\n\\npilots making the same argument. JA 160, 209-10.\\nEven had it not, the Appeals Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s careful consideration is evident in its 79-page decision with three\\nappendices and 22 enclosures. JA155 to 713.\\nThe Pilots next assert that deference should\\nnot apply because PBGC does not employ formal,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrial-like procedures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in determining benefits. Pet.\\nat 19. But the Mead Court held just the opposite: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nwant of [formal] procedure here does not decide the\\ncase, for we have sometimes found reasons for Chevron deference even when no such administrative\\nformality was required and none was afforded . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n533 U.S. at 231. Moreover, such a requirement would\\nsubject every PBGC determination to de novo review,\\nbecause no provision of Title IV requires formal procedures, and this is untenable.\\nFinally, the Pilots return to the refrain that\\nPBGC has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobvious financial self-interest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d making\\ndeference \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparticularly inappropriate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 20.\\nThe district court dismissed this succinctly:\\nAlthough it may be true that any assets that\\nthe Corporation [PBGC] retained instead of\\nallocating to the plaintiffs could yield a return\\nto the Corporation, that is true in every case\\nin which the Corporation is appointed as trustee. . . . And because the plaintiffs do not\\nprovide any specific evidence of self-interested bias or misconduct that influenced the\\nbenefits determinations about which they\\ndisagree, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mem. at 13-14, the Court\\nfinds that the plaintiffs have not plausibly\\nalleged any misconduct by the Corporation\\nthat would warrant the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure\\n\\n\\x0c19\\n\\nfrom its conclusion that the Chevron framework applies in this case.\\nPet. App. at 49a-50a.\\nThis Court should do the same. The Pilots\\nprovide no reason for the Court to review the decisions\\nbelow.\\nII.\\n\\nTHE FACT THAT OTHER CIRCUITS\\nMIGHT NOT ADDRESS THE\\nQUESTION PRESENTED DOES NOT\\nELEVATE ITS SIGNIFICANCE.\\n\\nThe Pilots contend that certiorari is warranted\\nhere even though there is no circuit split, because\\nother circuits may never review the question presented and, according to the Pilots, there are signs\\nthey would disagree. Pet. at 21-23. But the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application of Chevron in this case was straightforward, and the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suggestion that other circuits\\nwould disagree is unfounded. Moreover, the lack of a\\nsplit in the circuits illustrates the narrowness of this\\nissue: a statutory scheme implemented by a single\\nagency and reviewed in a single circuit, applying\\ncomplex law to intensely fact-bound situations. There\\nis simply no reason for this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review.\\nThe Pilots note that Title IV limits venue for an\\naction against PBGC to the U.S. District Court for the\\nDistrict of Columbia when a plan is terminated and\\nno longer has a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprincipal office.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 21-22. They\\nspeculate that, if other circuits had an opportunity to\\nreview the issue, they would disagree with the D.C.\\nCircuit about deference. Id. at 22. But the circumstances of the two cases they cite were quite different\\n\\n\\x0c20\\n\\nfrom those here, and do not support the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assertion.\\nIn re Kaiser Aluminum Corp., 456 F.3d 328\\n(3d Cir. 2006), addressed how a bankruptcy court\\nshould apply the statutory \\xe2\\x80\\x9creorganization test\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\ndeciding whether to approve a pension plan termination. The Third Circuit declined to afford Chevron\\ndeference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation because \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]ssues\\nrelating to an employer\\'s bankruptcy and reorganization are within the expertise of bankruptcy courts, not\\nthe PBGC.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 456 F.3d at 344. That case says nothing\\nabout deference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination of pension\\nbenefits.\\nWilmington Shipping Co. v. New England Life\\nInsurance Co., 496 F.3d 326 (4th Cir. 2007), addressed\\nthe liability of a private sector insurance company for\\nalleged failure to manage plan assets. The case was\\ndecided with no PBGC involvement, and it did not\\neven mention Chevron, much less issue a holding\\nabout it. And many of its statements are demonstrably wrong (e.g., that PBGC, as statutory trustee, may\\npay lump sum benefits to participants). Again, this\\ncase says absolutely nothing about deference to\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination of pension benefits.\\nThe Pilots also assert in a footnote that the\\nDistrict of Columbia is PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forum of choice due to\\nthat court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9chighly deferential stance toward PBGC\\nas a government actor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 22, fn. 6. But it is\\nTitle IV that expressly mandates this venue. And the\\nD.C. Circuit reviews each matter on its merits and\\ndoes not serve as a rubber stamp for PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determinations. See, e.g., Stephens v. US Airways Group,\\nInc., 644 F.3d 437 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (holding against\\nPBGC on whether interest was due on lump sums\\npaid 45 days after a participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s retirement date).\\n\\n\\x0c21\\n\\nIn sum, the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application of Chevron in this case was straightforward and the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nassertions about other circuits are unfounded.\\nIII.\\n\\nTHIS CASE DOES NOT PRESENT AN\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cEXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nQUESTION ABOUT PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99S\\nPURPORTED SELF-INTEREST.\\n\\nIt is critically important to correctly pay participants the benefits they are due under Title IV of\\nERISA, and PBGC pays those amounts \\xe2\\x80\\x93 nothing\\nmore and nothing less. But the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assertion that\\nthis Court must step in to curb PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand ensure that PBGC and its contractors are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmunize[d]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccareful judicial scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is entirely\\nunfounded. Pet. at 23-26. The district court found\\nno support whatsoever for the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wild allegations,\\nPet App. at 49a-50a, and PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determinations here\\nare no different than those it must make in all other\\ncases.\\nThe Pilots allege that PBGC \\xe2\\x80\\x93 through its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsultants\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 perpetrated an elaborate scheme to\\npurposely misinterpret the statutory and regulatory\\nrules in order to pay benefits to the Pilots later in time\\nand earn greater returns by holding the plan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets\\nlonger. Pet. at 25. They cite reports by PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office\\nof inspector general and the Government Accountability Office on matters unrelated to this case, critical\\nof PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contractors. Id. at 23-25. But neither\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff nor its contractors would gain a penny\\nby inventing ways to pay less generous benefits to\\nsome participants and more generous benefits to\\nothers. As the district court held, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplaintiffs have not\\nplausibly alleged any misconduct by the Corporation\\n\\n\\x0c22\\n\\nthat would warrant the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from\\nprevailing deference standards. Pet. App. at 49a-50a.\\nAs described above, at pp. 2-5, PBGC determines benefits based on the applicable guarantee\\nlevel and, in cases where plan assets and PBGC\\nrecoveries permit, additional benefits (to the extent\\nthe benefit is not fully guaranteed). If PBGC were in\\nfact determining benefits to advance its financial selfinterest, all of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit determinations (not\\njust those made by PBGC purportedly in its capacity\\nas statutory trustee) would be suspect, as PBGC\\nwould gain financially just as well by paying lower\\nguaranteed benefits.\\nIn summary, the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 allegations of PBGC\\nself-interest merit no further review.\\nIV.\\n\\nTHIS CASE SERVES AS NO SPECIAL\\nVEHICLE FOR THIS COURT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S\\nREVIEW.\\n\\nThe Pilots argue that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]his case is an ideal\\nvehicle for the Court to address the significant legal\\nand practical issues implicated by the question presented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and assert that the earlier Davis litigation did\\nnot present such an opportunity. Pet. at 26-27. But\\nthe Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 characterizations of Davis and this case are\\nexaggerations, and there is no special reason why this\\nCourt need review the matter. The Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denial of\\ncertiorari in another case does not enhance the certworthiness of this case.\\nThe Pilots assert that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeference underpinned\\nthe D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review of each relevant aspect of\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allocation decisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. at 26. The court of\\nappeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision certainly upheld a Chevron review\\nof PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory interpretations, but it did not say\\n\\n\\x0c23\\n\\nthat without such deference PBGC would lose. Pet.\\nApp. at 1a-6a. And while the district court stated that\\nit was applying the appropriate deference to PBGC in\\nreviewing each of the amended complaint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims, it\\nnever said PBGC would lose without such deference.\\nPet. App. at 63a-89a.\\nThe Pilots correctly point out that the D.C.\\nCircuit in Davis II declined to reconsider the Chevron\\nissue, considering PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s arguments stronger regardless of any deference. Pet. at 26. But earlier,\\nwhen the D.C. Circuit in Davis I did address Chevron\\ndeference for PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s benefit determinations (in deciding whether the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 arguments were strong\\nenough for a preliminary injunction), the plaintiffs\\ncould have sought certiorari but chose not to do so.\\nIn summary, this case serves as no special\\nvehicle for reviewing the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 question presented,\\nand they fail to show the question presented to be outcome-determinative.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be\\ndenied.\\n\\n\\x0c24\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nF.

Id. at 19.\\nAnd it concedes there are no vehicle problems. Id. at\\n22-23. Indeed, this petition presents a straightforward question that merits this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention: did\\nthe D.C. Circuit wrongly extend Chevron deference to\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s construction of (admittedly) ambiguous statutory\\nprovisions\\nin\\ninformal,\\nnon-binding\\nadjudications, undertaken not in any congressionally\\nassigned regulatory capacity but instead as a plan\\ntrustee and fiduciary?\\nSo what does PBGC argue? In short, nothing that\\ndetracts from the cert-worthiness of the petition.\\nPBGC points out that only one agency is involved. Id.\\nat 19. It paints petitioners as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwild\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conspiracy theorists. Id. at 21-22. It says it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all very complicated.\\nId. at 19. And perhaps most tellingly, it spends half\\nof its opposition previewing its arguments in a vociferous defense of the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision below,\\nconfirming there really is much to debate on the merits. Id. at 8-19. What\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more, PBGC spends another\\nquarter of its brief describing the background and history of this litigation, illustrating just how much is at\\nstake here\\xe2\\x80\\x94namely, $2 billion in plan assets, allocated to thousands of plan participants, based on\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cagency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d decisions that are actually made by outside\\ncontractors. Id. at 2-7.\\nUltimately, review by this Court is necessary to\\nset critical limits on Chevron deference. Absent the\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention, many more of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pensioners will become subject to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s skewed\\ndecision-making in the event their plans terminate in\\ndistress. Even though Congress never assigned\\nPBGC the job and PBGC has a structural conflict in\\nfavor of its own fisc, PBGC will invariably take over\\nas a Title IV trustee and task itself with allocating\\nplan assets, leaning on Chevron to defend its constructions of Title IV\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asset-allocation scheme. And\\nthe D.C. Circuit, bound by its own precedent to employ an erroneously expansive view of Chevron, is\\ndestined to leave PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exercise of discretion unchecked and to reinforce the glaring inconsistency\\nbetween its deference to PBGC and the de novo scrutiny courts ordinarily give to ERISA-trustee statutory\\nconstructions. Finally, while the deference issues\\nhere play out against the backdrop of PBGC and\\nERISA, they are part of a broader, disquieting expansion of Chevron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reach endemic within the D.C.\\nCircuit, as this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent grant of certiorari in\\nAmerican Hospital Association v. Becerra, No. 201114 (cert. granted July 2, 2021), exemplifies.\\nThe Court should grant certiorari and reverse.\\nARGUMENT\\nI.\\n\\nPBGC ADMITS THAT THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCRITICALLY IMPORTANT\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nA. PBGC expressly states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]t is critically\\nimportant to correctly pay participants the benefits\\nthey are due under Title IV of ERISA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 21. According to PBGC, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpays those amounts\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing\\nmore and nothing less.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. But if petitioners are\\nright, then PBGC is paying far less than it should\\nbased on its improper interpretations of the many\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nambiguous statutory provisions that PBGC admits\\n(id. at 2 n.1) are relevant here, interpretations the\\nD.C. Circuit upheld based on its misapplication of the\\nChevron doctrine.\\nIn other words, PBGC acknowledges that the\\nquestion presented is important, but it then spends\\npage after page of its opposition trying to persuade\\nthis Court not to get involved because petitioners are\\nsimply wrong on the merits. As an argument against\\nplenary review, that thinking is every bit as backwards as it sounds.\\nB. PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view of the merits is wrong in any\\nevent. For instance, PBGC points to Beck v. Pace International Union, 551 U.S. 96 (2007), Mead Corp. v.\\nTilley, 490 U.S. 714 (1989), and PBGC v. LTV Corp.,\\n496 U.S. 633 (1990), and concludes that this Court\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chas already rejected the Pilots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument that PBGC\\nis so \\xe2\\x80\\x98inherently conflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in applying [\\xc2\\xa71344(a)] that\\ndeference cannot apply.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 9-10. But none of those\\ncases had anything to do with the PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretations of multiple ambiguous statutory provisions in\\nits role as a Title IV trustee. See Beck, 551 U.S. at\\n103-04; Tilley, 490 U.S. at 716; LTV Corp., 496 U.S.\\nat 636. PBGC was not even a party in two of the\\ncases; it appeared as amicus curiae. Beck, 551 U.S. at\\n104; Tilley, 490 U.S. at 722.\\nIn two other cases, United States v. Mead Corp.,\\n533 U.S. 218, 226-27 (2001), and Barnhart v. Walton,\\n535 U.S. 212, 222 (2002), this Court made clear that\\nnot all agency pronouncements deserve deference under Chevron. PBGC does not even try to distinguish\\nBarnhardt, and it says Mead actually leans in its favor, because the agency has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprecisely the delegated\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nauthority that Mead requires.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 15. PBGC, however, never grapples with petitioners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assertion that\\nalthough PBGC may be entitled to Chevron deference\\nwhen it engages in rulemaking or other \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegislative\\ntype of activity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mead Corp., 533 U.S. at 232, the text\\nof \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa71342 and 1344 make clear that Congress did not\\nintend for the agency to be treated any differently\\nthan a private trustee in making asset-allocation decisions.\\nAccordingly, PBGC is wrong about Beck, Tilley,\\nLTV Corp., Barnhardt, and Mead. Far more can, and\\nwould, be said on plenary review. Nonetheless, it is\\nclear that there are two sides to the merits of this\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccritically important\\xe2\\x80\\x9d question\\xe2\\x80\\x94arguments that\\nshould be aired before this Court on plenary review.\\nC. In addition to its premature merits arguments, PBGC re-casts the question presented as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwild theory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimproper motive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d involving a conspiracy in which \\xe2\\x80\\x9centire teams of\\ngovernment employees . . . create a complex arrangement to enrich the federal coffers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 1, 8, 21.\\nRespectfully, any \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwild allegations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9celaborate\\nscheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are the product of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own imagination.\\nSee id. at 21.\\nPBGC tilts at this windmill because it cannot dispute the importance of the true question presented.\\nThough PBGC takes great offense at the suggestion\\nthat, as an institution, it has every reason to interpret\\n\\xc2\\xa71344(a) to allow it to hold assets longer and generate\\ninterest for its use, see Pet. 25, it never outright disputes that financial incentives can permeate\\ninsurance systems, much less that PBGC faces those\\nincentives. Cf. Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Glenn, 554 U.S.\\n\\n\\x0c5\\n105, 111 (2008) (discussing how ERISA administrators may \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperat[e] under a conflict of interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\n(emphasis removed; internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\\nInstead of admitting that billions of dollars in\\nplan assets were allocated in a way that indisputably\\nbenefitted its own bottom line, PBGC says no individual employee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgain[ed] a penny.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 21. That, of\\ncourse, was never petitioners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument. PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s systemic interest in preserving the public fisc may be\\nlaudable, but it also creates a structural conflict of interest. Next, rather than admit that the work of its\\nconsultants has been found to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98seriously flawed,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPet. 23 (quoting statement of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of Inspector General), PBGC says those mistakes were made\\nin different cases. See Opp. 21. Never mind that the\\nsame consultants divvied up the plan assets in this\\ncase too. D.C. Cir. J.A. Vols. II-III at JA223, JA11791222. With respect to the criminal convictions of\\nother outside consultants, see Pet. 23-24, PBGC says\\nthere was no finding of misconduct here. Opp. 21-22.\\nAs to fiduciary obligations? PBGC denies having any.\\nSee id. at 10. And what about holding PBGC to the\\nsame standards as all other Title IV trustees (see Pet.\\n9)? Because it has taken over as trustee for virtually\\nall failed pension plans, PBGC declares there are\\nnone to which it can be compared. Opp. 12.1\\n1 PBGC even says the Court cannot \\xe2\\x80\\x9cneatly divide[]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d its suppos-\\n\\nedly singular \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbenefit determination process,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d deferring to\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretations when it has performed one step as guarantor and conducting de novo review of other steps PBGC has\\ntaken as trustee. Opp. 11. It is true that PBGC has adopted a\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nPBGC concedes\\xe2\\x80\\x94as it must\\xe2\\x80\\x94that all five of the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTitle IV provisions centrally at issue in the litigation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nare \\xe2\\x80\\x9cambiguous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 2 n.1. As noted, it admits that\\nit is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccritical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to get the answers right. Yet, at root,\\nPBGC insists none of this matters\\xe2\\x80\\x94not the ambiguity, not the importance of the issue, not PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninherently conflicted status, not the flawed work of its\\nactual decision-makers. It declares that it has taken\\nover all of the duties in Title IV and, as a government\\nagency dealing with a complicated statute, it is entitled to maximum deference. Id. at 1. But Chevron\\nhas never attached merely when \\xe2\\x80\\x9can administrative\\nofficial is involved,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243,\\n258 (2006), and there is even more reason to withhold\\ndeference given the PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trustee role here and the\\ndubious manner in which it has implemented its trustee obligations.\\nII. PBGC ADMITS THAT THE QUESTION PRESENTED CAN ARISE ONLY IN THE D.C.\\nCIRCUIT, WHOSE POSITION IS FIRMLY\\nENTRENCHED\\nThe D.C. Circuit has made clear it will apply Chevron deference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory determinations,\\npractice in which it provides a single document to each plan participant reflecting the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination of that\\nparticipant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstatutory benefit,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which includes both guaranteed benefits and the participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share of recovered plan\\nassets. But it is just that\\xe2\\x80\\x94a practice. As demonstrated by\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own description of the post-termination processes, id. at\\n4, there is no singular \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTitle IV program benefit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 11-12.\\nPBGC calculates guaranteed non-forfeitable benefits under one\\nrubric. Id. at 3-4. And it divides recovered plan assets under\\nanother set of rules. Id. at 4.\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nregardless of whether PBGC is acting as trustee rather than guarantor. In Davis v. PBGC, 571 F.3d\\n1288, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavis I\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the D.C. Circuit saw \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno reason to depart from the usual deference\\n[given] to an agency interpreting its organic statute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand held that Chevron applied to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory\\ninterpretations as Title IV trustee. The decision below rejected the argument that the question\\npresented was still open, expressly stating that the\\ncircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holding in Davis I \\xe2\\x80\\x9cremains binding precedent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 3a. And the D.C. Circuit recently\\ncited Davis I in another case in which it deferred to\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory interpretations. See Fisher v.\\nPBGC, 994 F.3d 664, 670 (D.C. Cir. 2021).\\nFurther debate about the question presented in\\nthe petition has been foreclosed by the D.C. Circuit,\\nwhich is the only circuit in which the question will\\never arise. PBGC concedes as much, Opp. 19, but\\nnonetheless tries to obscure this crucial fact by insisting that two Third and Fourth Circuit cases\\nmentioned in the petition (refusing to give Chevron\\ndeference to PBGC) are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquite different.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 19-21.\\nOf course, those cases \\xe2\\x80\\x9csay[] absolutely nothing about\\ndeference to PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination of pension benefits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 20, because that question will never be\\nheard in those courts. That is precisely the point: the\\nquestion presented can arise only in the D.C. Circuit,\\nmaking a circuit split an impossibility.\\nIn case after case, the D.C. Circuit and district\\ncourts within the circuit have declined independently\\nto weigh evidence in matters involving PBGC; they\\nhave held that PBGC decisions are unreviewable as a\\nmatter of prosecutorial discretion; and, when they\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nactually reach the merits, they apply deferential\\nstandards of review. See Pet. 22 n.6. PBGC responds\\nby saying that the D.C. Circuit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not serve as a\\nrubber stamp for PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determinations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 20.\\nIn support, PBGC cites a single case. Id. (citing Stephens v. US Airways Grp., Inc., 644 F.3d 437 (D.C.\\nCir. 2011)).\\nPBGC has spent more than a decade ensuring that\\nall cases involving its post-termination actions as Title IV trustee are funneled to the D.C. Circuit. See\\nPet. 21-22. Remarkably, PBGC now says this Court\\nshould not bother itself with this petition, because it\\ninvolves \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca statutory scheme implemented by a single\\nagency and reviewed in a single circuit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 19.\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions should not evade review simply because it has managed to consolidate venue and\\nprevent any prospect of a circuit split.\\nIII. PBGC CONCEDES THERE ARE NO VEHICLE PROBLEMS\\nThis case squarely presents the legal question\\nwhether PBGC is entitled to Chevron deference when\\nit takes over a role, as a Title IV trustee, that Congress never intended it to have. PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s response is\\nto say this case does not serve as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d vehicle to\\nresolve that question. Id. at 22. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpecial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or not,\\nnothing about this case makes it an unsuitable vehicle to address the question.\\nCompare this case to an earlier one concerning\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asset allocations for a different plan, Davis v.\\nPBGC, 734 F.3d 1161 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDavis II\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). In\\nDavis II, the D.C. Circuit held that the plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nclaims failed. Although the plaintiffs there made similar arguments against affording Chevron deference\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nto PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allocation decisions, the court made clear\\nit would have reached the same result with or without\\ndeference. Id. at 1167. That is to say, deference was\\nnot outcome determinative.\\nThis case is a different story altogether. Here, the\\nD.C. Circuit did not say it would have affirmed a single aspect of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision-making without the aid\\nof Chevron deference. Its silence is instructive, given\\nthe overtly different approach in Davis II.\\nPBGC retorts that the question presented cannot\\nbe outcome determinative because the petition does\\nnot affirmatively show that petitioners would win absent deference. Opp. 22-23. This has it exactly\\nbackwards: every issue in dispute turns on whether\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s allocation decisions are entitled to deference,\\nsee Pet. 26-27, with PBGC conceding that every key\\nstatutory provision at issue is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cambiguous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 2\\nn.1. Importantly, PBGC does not dispute petitioners\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nargument that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeference underpinned the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review of each relevant aspect of PBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nallocation decisions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. 26. PBGC, rather, admits\\nthat the D.C. Circuit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cupheld a Chevron review of\\nPBGC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory interpretations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe district court stated . . . it was applying the appropriate\\ndeference to PBGC in reviewing each of the amended\\ncomplaint\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opp. 22-23.\\nPBGC also attempts to manufacture meaning\\nfrom the fact that the Davis I retirees chose not to\\nseek certiorari. See id. at 23. However, a strategic\\ndecision made in 2009 by an entirely different group\\nof appellants on different footing says nothing about\\nwhether, more than a decade later, a case rising and\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nfalling on deference alone is a good vehicle to decide\\nthe question presented.\\nIn sum, on remand, once this Court addresses the\\nlimitations on Chevron, the many ambiguous statutory provisions identified by PBGC will need to be\\ninterpreted de novo. That is precisely what it means\\nto be a good vehicle in a Chevron-oriented petition.\\nIV. THE COURT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S GRANT OF CERTIORARI IN\\nAMERICAN HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION REINFORCES THE CERT-WORTHINESS OF\\nTHIS PETITION\\nThe Court recently granted certiorari to review the\\nD.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application of Chevron. See Am. Hosp.\\nAss\\xe2\\x80\\x99n v. Becerra, No. 20-1114. The petition in American Hospital Association asserts that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe decision\\nbelow vividly confirms the continuing need for this\\nCourt to enforce limits on Chevron deference, particularly as it is applied in the D.C. Circuit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id., Pet.\\n15. It adds that the D.C. Circuit has engaged in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextreme application of Chevron\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f left\\nundisturbed, the decision will inevitably exert a\\nstrong and unwarranted gravitational pull in the direction of deference to agency interpretations of law\\nin the D.C. Circuit and beyond\\xe2\\x80\\x94exacerbating separation-of-powers concerns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 16.\\nJust as the Chevron question presented in the\\nMedicare context in American Hospital Association\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfundamentally\\xe2\\x80\\x9d implicated the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application of Chevron at large, id. at 15, the Chevron issue\\nraised here in the PBGC context cuts to the core of\\nChevron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viability and extension by the D.C. Circuit.\\nJust as in American Hospital Association, the Court\\nshould grant certiorari in this case or, at a minimum,\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nhold the petition in the event the Court realigns the\\nChevron doctrine in American Hospital Association.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be\\ngranted.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nPETER K.

The Eighth Circuit\\ninvalidated both the Down Syndrome Provision and\\nthe Gestational Age Restrictions as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccategorically\\nunconstitutional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under Planned Parenthood of\\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833\\n(1992). The questions presented are:\\n1. Whether Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restriction on abortions\\nperformed solely because the unborn child may have\\nDown syndrome is categorically invalid under Casey\\nand Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), or whether it is\\na valid, reasonable regulation of abortion that seeks\\nto prevent the elimination of children with Down\\nsyndrome through eugenic abortion?\\n2. Whether Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restrictions on abortions\\nperformed after eight, fourteen, eighteen, and twenty\\nweeks of gestational age are categorically invalid, or\\nwhether they are valid, reasonable regulations of\\nabortion that advance important state interests?\\n3. Whether the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpenumbral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d right to abortion\\nrecognized in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and\\npartially reaffirmed in Planned Parenthood of\\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania v.

The en banc Sixth Circuit has\\nupheld Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law, while the Eighth Circuit has\\nfollowed the Seventh Circuit in invalidating\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Arkansas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s laws.1 There are now\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompelling reasons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for this Court to review the\\nquestion. Sup. Ct. R. 10.\\n\\n1\\n\\nArkansas recently filed a petition for writ of certiorari\\nseeking review of the Eighth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision invalidating\\nits law, raising similar issues to this petition.

Children with\\nDown syndrome contribute unique beauty, joy, and\\ndiversity to their families and society. Yet the entire\\nDown syndrome community may, in upcoming years,\\nsimply dwindle away. This Court should not delay in\\nresolving this issue of critical importance.\\nJust one month ago, in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nHealth Organization, No. 19-1392 (U.S.) (order dated\\nMay 17, 2021), this Court granted certiorari to review\\nthe question \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]hether all pre-viability prohibitions\\non elective abortions are unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The\\nvalidity of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision\\npresents the Court with an additional, critical\\ndimension of that very question. The Circuits that\\nhave invalidated restrictions on abortions of children\\nwith Down syndrome, like the Eighth Circuit below,\\nhave all relied on the mistaken notion that any\\nprohibition on pre-viability elective abortions is\\ncategorically unconstitutional\\xe2\\x80\\x94the very proposition\\nto be reviewed in Dobbs. This disturbing outcome\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ni.e., holding that States may not act to prevent the\\neugenic elimination of an entire disabled\\ncommunity\\xe2\\x80\\x94demonstrates the absurdity of giving a\\npositive answer to the question presented in Dobbs.\\nConsidering the validity of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down\\nSyndrome Provision in parallel with Mississippi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 15week gestational-age restriction at issue in Dobbs will\\npermit the Court to consider two important\\ndimensions of the same question\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]hether all\\npre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are\\nunconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nOPINIONS BELOW\\nThe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion granting a preliminary\\ninjunction against Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Gestational Age\\nRestrictions, Mo.

Planned Parenthood of\\nIndiana & Kentucky, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780, 1782\\n(2019). At that time, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[o]nly the Seventh Circuit ha[d]\\nthus far addressed this kind of law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the Court\\nfollowed its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cordinary practice of denying petitions\\ninsofar as they raise legal issues that have not been\\nconsidered by additional Courts of Appeals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n(citing this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rule 10).\\nThe Circuit split that was lacking at the time of\\nBox has now arisen. Since the Seventh Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision in Box invalidating Indiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prohibition\\nagainst disability-selective abortions, the Sixth and\\nEighth Circuits have addressed the validity of similar\\nlaws in Ohio, Arkansas, and Missouri. The laws of\\nthree States (Indiana, Arkansas, and Missouri) have\\nbeen invalidated, while Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law has been upheld,\\nall in thoroughly reasoned, published opinions.\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nCompare Preterm-Cleveland v. McCloud, 994 F.3d 512\\n(6th Cir. Apr. 13, 2021) (en banc) (upholding Ohio\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlaw), with App. 16a (invalidating Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law);\\nLittle Rock Fam. Plan. Servs. v. Rutledge, 984 F.3d\\n682, 690 (8th Cir. 2021), cert. pet\\xe2\\x80\\x99n filed, No. 20-1434\\n(U.S. Apr. 9, 2021); (invalidating Arkansas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law);\\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana & Kentucky, Inc. v.\\nComm\\xe2\\x80\\x99r of Indiana State Dep\\xe2\\x80\\x99t of Health, 888 F.3d\\n300, 306 (7th Cir. 2018), rev\\xe2\\x80\\x99d in part on other grounds\\nsub nom. Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana &\\nKentucky, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780 (2019) (invalidating\\nIndiana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law). Moreover, these cases have produced\\na wealth of separate concurring and dissenting\\nopinions analyzing the issues presented from every\\nside. See, e.g., App. 17a (Stras, J., concurring in the\\njudgment in part and dissenting in part); Pre-Term\\nCleveland v. McCloud, 994 F.3d 512, 535 (6th Cir.\\n2021) (en banc) (Sutton, J., concurring); id. at 538\\n(Griffin, J., concurring); id. at 540 (Bush, J.,\\nconcurring); id. at 550 (Cole, C.J., dissenting); id. at\\n551 (Moore, J., dissenting); id. at 563 (Clay, J.,\\ndissenting); id. at 568 (Gibbons, J., dissenting); id. at\\n569 (Donald, J., dissenting); Preterm-Cleveland, 940\\nF.3d at 318 (Batchelder, J., dissenting); PPINK, 888\\nF.3d at 311 (Manion, J., concurring in the judgment);\\nPPINK, 917 F.3d 532, 536 (7th Cir. 2018)\\n(Easterbrook, J., dissenting from the denial of\\nrehearing en banc). No further percolation is needed;\\nthis is a well-developed, thoroughly considered split of\\nauthority.\\nThis Circuit split, moreover, implicates the laws of\\nmany other States as well. At least 12 States have\\nenacted such laws, and many other States are actively\\nconsidering them. See supra. Thus, there is a clear,\\nwell-developed Circuit split on an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimportant matter,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\x0c20\\nwhich provides a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompelling reason[]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to review the\\nquestion. Sup. Ct. R. 10(a).\\nMoreover, this Term presents a uniquely\\nappropriate juncture for the Court to address this\\nimportant issue. In Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Health\\nOrganization, No. 19-1392 (May 17, 2021), this Court\\ngranted certiorari to review the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]hether\\nall pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are\\nunconstitutional,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the context of Mississippi\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstatute prohibiting abortions after 15 weeks\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ngestation. See id. The dispute over Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down\\nSyndrome Provision presents another face of the same\\ncoin. All three circuit-court decisions invalidating\\nstate restrictions on abortions targeted at Down\\nsyndrome rest on the proposition that all pre-viability\\nprohibitions on elective abortions are categorically\\nunconstitutional. App. 8a (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBans on pre-viability\\nabortions are categorically unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d);\\nRutledge, 984 F.3d at 687 (holding that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreviability rule is categorical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and must be \\xe2\\x80\\x9capplied \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\ncategorically\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); PPINK, 888 F.3d at 305 (stating that\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cholding that a woman has the right to terminate\\nher pregnancy prior to viability is categorical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cunambiguous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The validity of state restrictions on\\nDown syndrome abortions presents an important\\ndimension of the same question that this Court has\\nalready granted certiorari to review in Dobbs.\\nFurther, addressing this question presents a\\nmatter of great urgency. As noted above, the abortion\\nrate for children with Down syndrome in America is\\nbetween 67 and 93 percent. That presents an\\nexistential crisis for the entire Down syndrome\\ncommunity, which is already on the verge of\\nelimination in other Western countries.\\n\\n\\x0c21\\nFinally, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case presents an ideal vehicle\\nto review this issue. The parties created a robust\\nrecord on the validity of the Down Syndrome\\nProvision, including expert declarations that address\\nthe issue in great detail. See, e.g., C.A. App. 370\\xe2\\x80\\x9373,\\n432\\xe2\\x80\\x9341, 509\\xe2\\x80\\x9327. This evidence includes historical\\nanalysis, contemporary studies, empirical evidence\\nregarding the frequency of Down syndrome abortions,\\nand testimony about the impact of medicalized\\nprejudice on the epidemic of abortions of children with\\nDown syndrome. See id. The validity of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nDown Syndrome Provision was the principal focus of\\nbriefing in the Court of Appeals, and the Eighth\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s majority and dissenting opinions address the\\nissue in significant detail. App. 1a\\xe2\\x80\\x9330a.\\nB. The Eighth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resolution of this\\nquestion was erroneous.\\nThe Court should also grant review because\\nEighth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision invalidating Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nDown Syndrome Provision was gravely erroneous.\\n1. Casey did not decide this issue.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhatever else might be said about Casey, it did\\nnot decide whether the Constitution requires States\\nto allow eugenic abortions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Box, 139 S. Ct. at 1792\\n(Thomas, J., concurring). On the contrary, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe very\\nfirst paragraph of the respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 brief in Casey\\nmade it clear to the Court that Pennsylvania\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprohibition on sex-selective abortions was \\xe2\\x80\\x98not [being]\\nchallenged.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. (alteration in original). When an\\nissue \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas not \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 raised in briefs or argument nor\\ndiscussed in the opinion of the Court,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d then \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe case\\nis not a binding precedent on this point.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d United\\nStates v. L.A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc., 344 U.S. 33,\\n38 (1952); see also, e.g., Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better\\n\\n\\x0c22\\nEnv\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998); Lewis v.

Ct. 1112, 1140 (2019) (Breyer, J.,\\ndissenting) (quoting Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419,\\n424 (2004)).\\nIn fact, Roe v. Wade explicitly rejected the\\nargument that a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to abortion \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis\\nabsolute and that she is entitled to terminate her\\npregnancy \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 for whatever reason she alone chooses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRoe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 153 (1973) (emphasis\\nadded). Roe stated: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith this we do not agree.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nNor should Casey be interpreted as implying, in\\ndicta, that all pre-viability restrictions on abortion are\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccategorically unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 8a. One of\\nCasey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central conclusions was that the strict\\nscrutiny that had applied to abortion restrictions\\nsince Roe was too stringent, because it gave \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctoo little\\nacknowledgement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to valid state interests in fetal life\\nand women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health. 505 U.S. at 871. Casey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nadoption of the undue-burden standard was designed\\nto relax the level of scrutiny on abortion restrictions,\\nnot heighten it. Id. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccategorical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rule followed by\\nthe Seventh and Eighth Circuits would subject\\nrestrictions on pre-viability abortion to the only level\\nof scrutiny that is more exacting scrutiny than strict\\nscrutiny. This interpretation turns Casey on its head.\\nIt also yields absurd results.\\nThe rule of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccategorical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d invalidity of restrictions on pre-viability\\nabortion has the perverse result of elevating the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpenumbral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d right to abortion above enumerated\\nrights such as freedom of speech, freedom of religion,\\nand freedom from state-imposed racial segregation.\\nThis Court has held that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceven the fundamental rights\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nof the Bill of Rights are not absolute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kovacs v.\\nCooper, 336 U.S. 77, 85 (1949), and it has held that\\nrights enumerated in the Bill of Rights may be\\nsometimes restricted by government policies that are\\nnarrowly\\ntailored\\nto\\nadvance\\ncompelling\\ngovernmental interests. See, e.g., Bethune-Hill v.\\nVirginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 800\\xe2\\x80\\x9302\\n(2017); Fisher v. University of Texas, 136 S. Ct. 2198,\\n2208 (2016); Williams-Yulee v.

Yet the Eighth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrule immunizes pre-viability abortion even from\\nregulations that satisfy strict scrutiny. It elevates the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpenumbral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d right to pre-viability abortion above the\\nConstitution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enumerated rights, which is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsurd.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPPINK, 888 F.3d at 311 (Manion, J., concurring in the\\njudgment in part and dissenting in part).\\nFurther, Casey is a logical misfit with an antidiscrimination provision like Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down\\nSyndrome Provision. Casey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viability framework\\nrested on its holding that the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests in\\nprotecting fetal life and promoting women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health\\nbecome increasingly compelling as gestational age\\nincreases. See 505 U.S. at 860, 870\\xe2\\x80\\x9371. But the\\nState\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anti-discrimination interest in preventing the\\neugenic abortion of people with Down syndrome is\\nequally compelling at any gestational age. Children\\nwith Down syndrome are eliminated with equal\\npermanence regardless of whether the fetus was\\nviable at the time of the abortion, and regardless of\\nthe gestational age at which the abortion occurs.\\nCasey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s viability framework, therefore, has no logical\\napplication to an anti-discrimination provision like\\nthe Down Syndrome Provision.\\n\\n\\x0c24\\n2.\\n\\nThe Down Syndrome Provision\\nsatisfies any level of scrutiny.\\n\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision satisfies\\nstrict scrutiny or any other level of scrutiny, because\\nit is precisely tailored to advance at least eight\\ncompelling state interests.\\nFirst, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law advances the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncompelling interest in protecting an entire class of\\npersons from being targeted for elimination solely\\nbecause of disability. As Justice Thomas noted in Box,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis law and other laws like it promote a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncompelling interest in preventing abortion from\\nbecoming a tool of modern-day eugenics.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Box, 139 S.\\nCt. at 1783 (Thomas, J., concurring). In other\\ncontexts, the Court has recognized that the States\\nhave a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompelling interest in eliminating\\ndiscrimination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that justifies some restrictions on\\nrights. Bd. of Dirs. of Rotary Int\\xe2\\x80\\x99l v. Rotary Club of\\nDuarte, 481 U.S. 537, 549 (1987); Roberts v. U.S.\\nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).

The\\nhistory of medicalized discrimination against persons\\nwith Down syndrome is both recent and appalling,\\n\\n\\x0c25\\nand the Down Syndrome Provision serves to eradicate\\nthe ongoing vestiges of that history. See supra\\nStatement of the Case, Part A. In enacting the Down\\nSyndrome Provision, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legislature found that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[r]emoving vestiges of any past bias or discrimination\\nagainst \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 unborn children, is an important task for\\nthose in the legal, medical, social services, and human\\nservices professions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe abortion of unborn\\nchildren with Down Syndrome \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 is a form of bias or\\ndisability discrimination and victimizes the disabled\\nunborn child at his or her most vulnerable stage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nApp. 71a, 72a; Mo.

As the stories of people\\nlike Chris Nikic and countless others attest, people\\nwith Down syndrome provide an irreplaceable beauty,\\njoy, and inspiration to their communities and our\\nsociety. They make us better people. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHuman beings\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98of difference\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 have much to share with all of us\\nabout what it means to be human.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marsha Saxton,\\nDisability Rights and Selective Abortion, in ABORTION\\nWARS: A HALF CENTURY OF STRUGGLE: 1950 TO 2000\\n(1998).

LOUIS MAG. (Mar. 21, 2014). Our\\nsociety would be incalculably diminished if persons\\nwith Down syndrome were eliminated\\xe2\\x80\\x94and we now\\nstand on the brink of that genocidal outcome.\\n3. Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law is narrowly tailored.\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision advances\\nthese compelling interests in the narrowest possible\\nfashion. The law prohibits performing an abortion\\nonly if the discriminatory purpose is the sole reason\\nfor the abortion, and only if the abortion provider has\\nactual knowledge of that discriminatory purpose: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\nperson shall perform or induce an abortion on a\\nwoman if the person knows that the woman is seeking\\nthe abortion solely because of a prenatal diagnosis,\\ntest, or screening indicating Down Syndrome or the\\n\\n\\x0c30\\npotential of Down Syndrome in an unborn child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App.\\n72a; Mo.

PPINK, 888\\nF.3d at 316 (Manion, J., concurring). Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9conly prohibit[s] abortions performed solely because of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 disability of the unborn child. The doctor also\\nmust know that the woman has sought the abortion\\nsolely for that purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. (emphasis in original).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese are provisions that apply only to very specific\\nsituations and carefully avoid targeting the purported\\ngeneral right to pre-viability abortion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey will\\nnot affect the vast majority of women who choose to\\nhave an abortion without considering the\\ncharacteristics of the child. Indeed, they will not even\\naffect women who consider the protected\\ncharacteristics along with other considerations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf it is at all possible to narrowly tailor abortion\\nregulations, [Missouri] has done so.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nBecause it is narrowly tailored to advance many\\ncompelling interests Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law satisfies strict\\nscrutiny. A fortiori, it satisfies any less stringent form\\nof scrutiny, including Casey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s undue-burden test and\\nrational-basis scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x94the latter of which is the\\nstandard that should apply here.\\nIn sum, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision is\\nnot \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccategorically\\xe2\\x80\\x9d invalid under Casey, because Casey\\nsaid nothing about it. And the right to abort children\\nwith Down syndrome is neither \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeeply rooted in this\\nNation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history and tradition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimplicit in the\\nconcept of ordered liberty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nWashington v.\\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720\\xe2\\x80\\x9321 (1997) (quotations\\nomitted). On the contrary, our society has repudiated\\n\\n\\x0c31\\nthe medicalized biases against disabled people that\\nterminated the lives of people Down syndrome for\\ndecades and now fuel the epidemic of Down syndrome\\nabortions. Thus, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law is subject to rationalbasis scrutiny, and it is valid so long as it reasonably\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfurthers the legitimate interest of the Government,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nGonzales, 550 U.S. at 146\\xe2\\x80\\x94which it plainly does.\\nIn the alternative, if the Court does not grant\\ncertiorari to review the validity of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down\\nSyndrome Provision, the Court should hold this\\npetition pending the resolution of Dobbs v.

Thus,\\nthe Gestational Age Provisions prohibiting abortions\\nperformed at or after 8, 14, 18, and 20 weeks\\ngestational age5 apply to pre-viability abortions.\\nNevertheless,\\nMissouri\\nargues\\nthat\\nthe\\nGestational Age Provisions do not ban pre-viability\\nabortions, but merely regulate them. This distinction\\nis significant. Bans on pre-viability abortions are\\ncategorically unconstitutional. See id. at 879; Little\\nRock Fam. Plan. Servs. v. Rutledge, 984 F.3d 682, 687\\n(8th Cir. 2021). A restriction, on the other hand, is\\npermissible so long as it does not impose \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca\\nsubstantial obstacle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the right to an abortion. See\\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 877. According to Missouri, because\\nthe Provisions still permit pre-viability abortions\\nbefore 8 weeks gestational age, they do not constitute\\ncategorical bans.\\n5 This is measured as 8, 14, 18, and 20 weeks from the first day\\nof a patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last menstrual cycle.\\n\\n\\x0c9a\\nWe have already rejected a similar argument in a\\nnearly identical statute. In Edwards v.

Like Missouri\\ndoes now, the State of Arkansas \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrie[d] to frame the\\nlaw as a regulation, not a ban, on pre-viability\\nabortions because they are available during the first\\n12 weeks (and thereafter if within the exceptions).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 1117. But because the Arkansas law \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprohibit[ed]\\nwomen from making the ultimate decision to\\nterminate a pregnancy at a point before viability,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it\\nconstituted a ban, not a regulation. Id.; see also MKB\\nMgmt. Corp. v.

Casey upheld,\\nin part, requirements for informed consent and for a\\n24-hour waiting period\\xe2\\x80\\x94it did not uphold a ban on all\\nabortions performed at certain points of a pre-viability\\npregnancy. 505 U.S. at 881\\xe2\\x80\\x9387. Under those\\nrequirements, patients could still obtain an abortion\\nat any point before fetal viability so long as they\\nreceived certain information 24 hours before\\nundergoing the procedure. See id. at 881. Here, by\\n\\n\\x0c10a\\ncontrast, there is nothing an individual in Missouri\\ncould lawfully do to obtain an abortion at or after the\\napplicable gestational age cut-off.6 See id. at 894\\xe2\\x80\\x9395\\n(explaining that an abortion statute \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust be judged\\nby reference to those for whom it is an actual rather\\nthan an irrelevant restriction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). These provisions do\\nnot merely have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe incidental effect of making it\\nmore difficult or more expensive to procure an\\nabortion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d before viability. Gonzales v.

Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007). As in Casey, the statute at issue\\nin Gonzales did not ban pre- viability abortions; rather, it\\noutlawed one of several medical techniques used for performing\\nabortions. Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 164\\xe2\\x80\\x9365.

Rather, it bans access to\\nan abortion entirely.\\nMissouri contends that the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nstatute performs a regulatory function because it\\npermits pre-viability abortions when the Down\\nsyndrome diagnosis is only part of the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmotivation. But it is well-established that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]hether\\nor not \\xe2\\x80\\x98exceptions are made for particular\\ncircumstances, a State may not prohibit any woman\\nfrom making the ultimate decision to terminate her\\npregnancy before viability.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Edwards, 786 F.3d at\\n1117 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 879); see also\\nStenehjem, 795 F.3d at 772 (explaining that\\nregulations are permissible when they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo no more\\nthan create a structural mechanism by which the\\nState \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 may express profound respect for the life of\\nthe unborn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 146)).\\nRegulations on pre-viability abortions are permissible\\nprovided they do not constitute an undue burden, see,\\ne.g., Casey, 505 U.S. at 887\\xe2\\x80\\x9394 (rejecting a spousal\\nnotification regulation that posed an undue burden),\\nbut bans on pre-viability abortions are not, see\\nEdwards, 786 F.3d at 1117.

At a minimum, Reproductive\\nHealth Services had to show that the law was likely\\nto prevent a woman from getting an abortion she\\notherwise would have lawfully received. See Winter\\nv. Nat. Res.

See Mo. Rev. Stat.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 188.038.2. It is not enough for a woman to receive a\\nprenatal diagnosis, test, or screening of Down\\nSyndrome (or the potential for it) in an unborn child\\nand then seek an abortion. Rather, for the statute to\\napply, (1) the abortion must be \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely because of\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it;\\nand (2) the provider must actually \\xe2\\x80\\x9cknow[]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of that\\nfact. Id. Even when providers are aware of a positive\\nDown Syndrome diagnosis, for example, nothing\\nprevents them from performing an abortion if they\\nknow nothing more. Nor is there any restriction when\\nproviders know that the diagnosis is one reason for the\\nabortion but remain in the dark about whether there\\nare others.\\nContrast these requirements with what Dr.\\nMcNicholas said in her declaration. According to her,\\nshe treated three women who \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad received a fetal\\ndiagnosis of Down [S]yndrome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe last 12\\nmonths,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that there had been\\nothers too. The declaration is conspicuous for what it\\ndoes not say. Nowhere does it mention whether any of\\nthese women sought an abortion \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely because of\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ntheir prenatal diagnoses, much less whether she knew\\nit at the time. Id. Both are required for Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nDown Syndrome Provision to apply. See id.\\nA.\\nCausation poses the biggest hurdle for\\nReproductive Health Services. No matter how many\\nof Dr. McNicholas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients have received a positive\\nDown Syndrome diagnosis\\xe2\\x80\\x94three, three hundred, or\\nthree thousand\\xe2\\x80\\x94nothing in her declaration\\nestablishes that any of them sought an abortion solely\\nbecause of it. See id.\\n\\n\\x0c21a\\nThe burden of establishing entitlement to a\\npreliminary injunction always rests with the party\\nseeking one. See Watkins Inc., 346 F.3d at 844. There\\nmay well be women in Missouri who terminate their\\npregnancies solely because of a positive Down\\nSyndrome diagnosis, test, or screening, but the\\nproblem is that Reproductive Health Services has not\\nidentified any of them. It instead asks us to fill in the\\ngaps\\xe2\\x80\\x94basically, guess\\xe2\\x80\\x94that there are women out\\nthere who do so, despite the variety of \\xe2\\x80\\x9chealth, family,\\nfinancial, [and] other personal reasons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that can\\nfactor into a decision to terminate a pregnancy.\\nPreterm-Cleveland v. McCloud, 994 F.3d 512, 526 (6th\\nCir. 2021) (en banc) (plurality opinion). Courts are not\\nsupposed to grant injunctions based on guesses.\\nThe district court decided to guess anyway. When\\nDr. McNicholas failed to say whether any of the\\nwomen she treated had sought an abortion solely\\nbecause of a positive diagnosis, the court used its\\nimagination:\\n[c]ommon understanding and judicial notice would\\nconclude that a Down [S]yndrome diagnosis (or\\neven a strong suspicion based on testing) would\\noften be received with dismay by a pregnant\\nwoman and any family members. If an abortion\\nwere sought thereafter, most of us, including an\\nabortion provider, would suppose that the\\ndiagnosis was the principal cause of the request,\\nand that a jury or licensing agency would have\\nlittle trouble with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csole cause\\xe2\\x80\\x9d requirement for\\na violation.

Absent knowledge that\\na Down Syndrome diagnosis is the sole reason for an\\nabortion, the statute does not apply. See id.\\n\\n\\x0c23a\\nDr. McNicholas all but admits in her declaration\\nthat she has no idea how many women, if any, seek an\\nabortion solely for that reason. See id. Consider her\\nwords carefully. In addition to never identifying any\\nwomen who sought abortions \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely because of\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a\\nDown Syndrome diagnosis, she goes on to say that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is generally no medical need for [her], or any\\nother physician providing abortion care at [the clinic,]\\nto know a patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reason for seeking an abortion or\\nto distinguish between one particular fetal diagnosis\\nor another in order to provide compassionate, safe\\nabortion care.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If there is no medical reason to ask,\\nand no evidence that the reason for seeking an\\nabortion is routinely volunteered, then the statute\\nitself cannot create the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthreat of irreparable harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nDataphase Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d at 114.\\nRather, the harm comes from Dr. McNicholas\\nherself, or at least her view of the law. She claims\\nthat, if she learns of any fetal anomaly, then she will\\nhave to ask whether it is Down Syndrome, just\\nbecause of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegal risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d involved. If a woman then\\nadmits that her unborn child has a positive Down\\nSyndrome diagnosis, Dr. McNicholas will \\xe2\\x80\\x9cturn her\\naway and advise her that she cannot get this care in\\nMissouri.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This statute-made-me-do-it theory would\\nmake sense if the statute made her do it.

See Mo. Rev.\\nStat. \\xc2\\xa7 188.038.2. And with no medical reason to\\ninquire, it is her choice to ask the question. Then, if a\\nwoman answers by saying she has received a positive\\nDown Syndrome diagnosis, it is again Dr.\\nMcNicholas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s choice not to perform the abortion,\\n\\n\\x0c24a\\nassuming the woman has not told her that the\\ndiagnosis is the sole reason she is seeking it. We\\ncannot enjoin a law based on what someone thinks it\\nsays, rather than what it actually says. Cf.

Republican Party of Minn., Third Cong. Dist. v.\\nKlobuchar, 381 F.3d 785, 791\\xe2\\x80\\x9393 (8th Cir. 2004). The\\ncourt seems persuaded:\\nThe district court did not clearly err in finding that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most likely scenario, from plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 filings,\\nwould be the provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s declining a requested\\nabortion, in terrorem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Thus, the district court\\nconcluded that absent a preliminary injunction,\\n[the plaintiffs] would be unable to provide previability abortions both to the patients who would\\notherwise obtain one \\xe2\\x80\\x9csolely\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the basis of a fetal\\ndiagnosis of Down [S]yndrome, and to the patients\\nfor whom the diagnosis is only part of the\\nmotivation, causing both types of patients to lose\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Constitutional right to which [they are]\\ncurrently entitled.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nAnte at 12\\xe2\\x80\\x9313 (emphasis added) (second and third\\nbrackets in original).\\nEven if this reasoning sounds plausible, there are\\nobvious problems with it.

The\\nproblem is that abortions are not protected\\nexpression, Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision is\\nnot vague or overbroad (nor is there any claim that it\\nis), and the chill is not an objectively reasonable\\nresponse to the statute.

The district\\ncourt then put its own gloss on her statement when it\\nused its \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[c]ommon understanding and judicial notice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nto announce that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca jury or licensing agency would\\nhave little trouble with the \\xe2\\x80\\x98sole cause\\xe2\\x80\\x99 requirement\\n\\n\\x0c26a\\nfor a violation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d if a woman sought an abortion in those\\ncircumstances. Today, the court adds yet another\\ngloss by declaring that the district court found \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat\\nthe Down Syndrome Provision would likely be\\nenforced against [Reproductive Health Services] \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\neven absent certain knowledge that the patient is\\nseeking an abortion \\xe2\\x80\\x98solely\\xe2\\x80\\x99 because of Down\\nSyndrome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ante at 13 n.9. Just like in the telephone\\ngame, the message in the end bears little resemblance\\nto the message at the start. Dr. McNicholas did not\\nsay any of these things, and the district court did not\\nactually make a factual finding. Indeed, the district\\ncourt relied on \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[c]ommon understanding and judicial\\nnotice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d precisely because there was no evidence on\\nthese points.11 See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6) (providing\\nthat the clear-error standard applies to findings\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbased on oral or other evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added));\\nsee also Am. Prairie Constr. Co. v. Hoich, 560 F.3d\\n780, 796 (8th Cir. 2009) (reviewing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecision to take\\njudicial notice [of a fact] for abuse of discretion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nReproductive Health Services wants us to fill in\\nthe gaps on causation and knowledge through\\nguesswork. That is not how preliminary injunctions\\nwork. It had the burden to connect all the dots for us,\\nand its failure to do so provides reason enough to\\nvacate the preliminary injunction. See Watkins Inc.,\\n346 F.3d at 844 (explaining that failure to establish a\\nthreat of irreparable harm \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis an independently\\nsufficient ground upon which to deny a preliminary\\ninjunction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n11 As for the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actual findings, I agree that not a\\nsingle one of them is clearly erroneous. They simply fall short of\\njustifying a preliminary injunction.\\n\\n\\x0c27a\\nIII.\\nNothing in Little Rock Family Planning Services v.\\nRutledge, 984 F.3d 682 (8th Cir. 2021), is to the\\ncontrary. In Rutledge, a panel of this court concluded\\nthat the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits\\nof a challenge to a similar Arkansas statute. See id. at\\n688\\xe2\\x80\\x9390. Even if Rutledge creates a likelihood of\\nsuccess on the merits here, Reproductive Health\\nServices is still not entitled to a preliminary\\ninjunction without showing a threat of irreparable\\nharm. See Dataphase Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d at 114 n.9.\\nIn any event, I think there is reason to doubt\\nwhether Rutledge was correctly decided, even if this\\npanel has to follow it. See Mader v. United States, 654\\nF.3d 794, 800 (8th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt is a\\ncardinal rule in our circuit that one panel is bound by\\nthe decision of a prior panel.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quotation marks\\nomitted)); see also Preterm-Cleveland, 994 F.3d at 516,\\n535 (concluding that a challenge to a similar, but even\\nmore restrictive, law was not likely to succeed on the\\nmerits). It treated Arkansas\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome\\nProvision as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete prohibition o[n] abortions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cban,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so to speak\\xe2\\x80\\x94not just a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rutledge,\\n984 F.3d at 688\\xe2\\x80\\x9390. This distinction is critical\\nbecause, under our precedent, a pre-viability ban is\\ncategorically unconstitutional. See id. at 687\\xe2\\x80\\x9388; MKB\\nMgmt. Corp. v. Stenehjem, 795 F.3d 768, 772\\xe2\\x80\\x9373 (8th\\nCir. 2015); Edwards v. Beck, 786 F.3d 1113, 1117 (8th\\nCir. 2015) (per curiam). A pre-viability regulation, on\\nthe other hand, is only unconstitutional if it has the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurpose or effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplac[ing] a substantial obstacle\\nin the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gonzales\\nv. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 146 (2007) (quoting Planned\\nParenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 878\\n(1992) (plurality opinion)).\\n\\n\\x0c28a\\nWe have not made it easy to tell the difference\\nbetween the two. In Edwards, we explained that a ban\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprohibits women from making the ultimate decision\\nto terminate a pregnancy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 786 F.3d at 1117. A\\nregulation, by contrast, has only an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincidental effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\non the decision by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmaking it more difficult or more\\nexpensive to procure an abortion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Gonzales, 550 U.S.\\nat 158 (quoting Casey, 505 U.S. at 874 (plurality\\nopinion)). The distinction is only complicated by the\\nfact that a regulation can easily be reframed as a ban:\\nif its requirements are not met, then a woman will be\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompletely prohibited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from having an abortion. Ante\\nat 9.\\nAs slippery as the dividing line seems to be, if I\\nwere writing on a blank slate, I would conclude that\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome Provision is a regulation.\\nRecall that it says that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]o person shall perform or\\ninduce an abortion on a woman if the person knows\\nthat the woman is seeking the abortion solely because\\nof a prenatal diagnosis, test, or screening indicating\\nDown Syndrome or the potential of Down Syndrome\\nin an unborn child.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mo. Rev. Stat. \\xc2\\xa7 188.038.2.\\nInterpreting the statute as an ordinary person would,\\nsee Wis. Cent. Ltd. v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2067,\\n2070 (2018), all it does is limit the reasons for an\\nabortion in certain narrow circumstances. As long as\\na woman has at least two reasons for seeking an\\nabortion, or her provider never knows that a positive\\nDown Syndrome diagnosis, test, or screening is her\\nsole reason for getting one, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ultimate decision\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nstill lies with her. Edwards, 786 F.3d at 1117 (quoting\\nCasey, 505 U.S. at 879 (plurality opinion)). The\\nstatute is, in other words, a regulation, not a ban. See\\nid.\\n\\n\\x0c29a\\nAn example may help. Title VII of the Civil Rights\\nAct of 1964 makes it unlawful \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor an employer \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 to\\ndischarge any individual \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 because of such\\nindividual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national\\norigin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2000e-2(a)(1). No one would\\nsuggest that Title VII is a ban on firing employees.\\nEven under Title VII\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broad language, which requires\\nthe reason to be nondiscriminatory, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe ultimate\\ndecision\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to terminate someone still rests with the\\nemployer. Edwards, 786 F.3d at 1117 (quoting Casey,\\n505 U.S. at 879 (plurality opinion)); see Berg v.\\nNorand Corp., 169 F.3d 1140, 1146 (8th Cir. 1999)\\n(noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he employment-at-will doctrine,\\nallowing an employer to terminate an employee for\\nany lawful reason, is [still] alive and well\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe same is true of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Down Syndrome\\nProvision. Women remain free to terminate their\\npregnancies for nondiscriminatory reasons. Indeed,\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s law is even more permissive than Title VII\\nin at least two respects: an abortion is still available,\\neven after a positive diagnosis, test, or screening, as\\nlong as (1) the provider does not know why a woman\\nis seeking an abortion; or (2) the discriminatory\\nreason\\nis\\naccompanied\\nby\\nat\\nleast\\none\\nnondiscriminatory reason.

This ruling is on\\nappeal.\\nA preliminary injunction was denied, however,\\nconcerning statutory prohibitions of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscriminatory\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nabortions of non-viable fetuses, where the sole reason\\nfor the abortion was the sex or race of the fetus.\\nDefendant providers disclaimed any knowledge of\\nsuch abortions at their facilities, and none could be\\npredicted, so the issue was deemed moot. Those\\nprohibitions remain on the statute books.\\nSimilarly denied, but without prejudice, was a\\npreliminary injunction motion against prohibiting\\n\\n\\x0c32a\\nabortions motivated by testing indicating Down\\nSyndrome. The prohibition of such abortions is\\nprescribed by Mo. Rev. Stat. \\xc2\\xa7 188.038.2. This subsection is the subject matter of a new motion for\\nreconsideration, or, in the alternative, for a\\npreliminary injunction. Doc. 59.1\\nThe earlier ruling on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown Syndrome abortions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nstated that abortions of non-viable fetuses have been\\nprotected under Federal case-law, based on Supreme\\nCourt decisions, and that plaintiff providers are\\nclearly \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikely to prevail in striking down the\\nprohibited reasons law, insofar as it applies to nonviable fetuses.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Doc. 51; Reproductive Health\\nServices of Planned Parenthood of St. Louis Region,\\nInc. v. Parson, 389 F. Supp. 3d 631, 636 (W.D. Mo.\\n2019). Injunctive relief could not be entered,\\nhowever, in the absence of a showing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\ninability to schedule \\xe2\\x80\\x98Down syndrome abortions\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nwould likely interfere with the abortion rights of reallife women during the time-frame of this law suit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 638. I suggested further consideration of \\xe2\\x80\\x9can\\nadequately supported renewed motion on this narrow\\nissue.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Such a motion was promptly filed, with\\nadditional information from co-plaintiff McNicholas,\\napparently the best informed person.2\\nBefore turning to the current factual situation and\\nthe legal contentions of the parties, a practical\\nconsideration may place this part of the dispute in\\ncontext. If a preliminary injunction continues to be\\nThe parties agree, as do I, that this is a collateral issue on\\nwhich I retain jurisdiction.\\n1\\n\\n2 The State Defendants do not question the information\\nsupplied, and offer nothing further \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but do contend that the\\nplaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 material remains insufficient to authorize relief.\\n\\n\\x0c33a\\ndenied, because of a deficiency in proof regarding\\nwomen likely to be seeking abortions because of Down\\nsyndrome testing of a fetus, there is a distinct\\npossibility that such an abortion patient may report to\\nplaintiff providers any day or week during litigation.\\nWithout injunctive protection in place, it is\\npredictable that a legal emergency would ensue; that\\nis, a temporary restraining order would be sought to\\nallow the abortion to take place. The likelihood of\\ngranting a TRO would be strong. There would then\\nlikely ensue hectic back-and-forth litigation like that\\nwhich occurred from October 18\\xe2\\x80\\x9326, 2017, as\\ndescribed in Azar v. Garza, 138 S. Ct. 1790 (2018).\\nWhile the courts may be disciplined to handle such\\nsituations, it would be most difficult to have the sort\\nof orderly and thorough appellate consideration ofthe\\nultimate merits that was invited by the Supreme\\nCourt on this very issue. Box v. Planned Parenthood\\nof Indiana and Kentucky, Inc., 139 S. Ct. 1780\\n(2019). I confess some relief that my appraisal of\\nthe factual situation here is consistent with an orderly\\nprocessing of the controversy.\\nThe facts do support injunctive relief now, as\\noutlined below, although the Down Syndrome\\ncondition in the population is quite rare, thus\\nsuggesting rather infrequent abortion requests. A\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown Syndrome Center\\xe2\\x80\\x9d brochure, submitted by\\nplaintiffs, suggests that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone in every 800\\xe2\\x80\\x931000\\nchildren\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been so diagnosed. Doc. 47-4, Ex. B. See\\ncomparable figures in Doc. 60-1 Ex. 1, p.4.3 But the\\nMcNicholas Supplemental Declaration (Doc. 60-1)\\nindicates that, even without inquiry by providers\\n3 This would relate to living children, thus failing to include\\nthe significant number of fetal abortions.\\n\\n\\x0c34a\\nbefore performing abortions, she specifically recalls\\nthat three patients she treated in the last 12 months\\nhad received \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca fetal diagnosis of Down Syndrome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xc2\\xb6 9. She also estimated she had \\xe2\\x80\\x9capproximately one to\\nfour cases per week\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reporting a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenetic or\\nstructural anomaly,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that Down syndrome is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most common fetal aneuploidy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (abnormal\\nnumber of chromosomes in a cell). \\xc2\\xb6 10.\\nThe only available information that might tend to\\nreduce the number of such patients was a review of\\nmedical records identifying only four patients in 13\\nmonths where Down Syndrome may have been\\npresent. Doc. 60-1, \\xc2\\xb6 11. But those records were\\nreferred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderinclusive,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a characterization not\\nquestioned by the State Defendants. The absence of\\ninformation and records is explained by plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nview prior to the new statute that abortion decisions\\nare for the patients to make, without any special\\ninquiries by the providers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 thus, any information\\nthat is available was inadvertently received.\\nWith the high level of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgenetic or structural\\nanomal[ies]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Down Syndrome being the most\\ncommon abnormality of numbers of chromosomes in a\\ncell, it should fairly be concluded that Dr. McNicholas\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\npersonal dealing with one identified Down Syndrome\\nabortion at about four-month intervals considerably\\nunderstates the abortions of that nature at plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfacility. If I would now project eight more months of\\nlitigation before judgment (perhaps by summary\\njudgment) I must conclude that at least a small\\nnumber of women would predictably need protection\\n\\n\\x0c35a\\nduring litigation, if the statutory prohibition is\\ninvalid.4\\nFor reasons mentioned earlier (Doc. 65, p. 3) the\\nState Defendants have not and are unlikely to belittle\\nthe significance of even a few abortions during\\nlitigation, and I conclude that the requested\\nprotection of the abortion rights of a few women\\nduring litigation should suffice to authorize shortterm anticipatory injunctive protection. I adopt but do\\nnot repeat legal discussion of standing issues and the\\nlike dealt with in the prior ruling, now in print, and in\\nthe denial of a stay. Doc. 65. These issues are on\\nappeal and should probably not be elaborated on or rearticulated while the Circuit Court has jurisdiction.\\nThe State Defendants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 most current procedural\\nobjection relies on two aspects of the circumstances at\\nbar. They repeatedly refer to the statutory\\nrequirement that the forbidden motive be the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csole\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncause of the abortion and they argue that there is an\\nabsence of the necessary \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccertainty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the prediction\\nof likely requests for the forbidden \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown syndrome\\nabortions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d citing Clapper v. Amnesty Int\\xe2\\x80\\x99l.

All except the ripeness\\nissue (relating to imminence of actual harm) may\\nbe readily rejected, at least for preliminary\\ninjunction purposes, for reasons noted by Judge\\nSutton in Planned Parenthood of Greater Ohio v.\\nHodges, 917 F.3d 908 (6th Cir. en banc 2019). While\\nthe Sutton majority opinion rejected a Planned\\nParenthood constitutional claim of public funding\\ndiscrimination, he wrote:\\nThird-party standing cases (are distinguishable).\\nIn those cases, the Supreme Court held that\\nabortion providers have standing to bring the due\\nprocess challenges on behalf of their patients.\\nSee, e.g., Singleton v.

They deal with contentions (now contested) as to fetal\\npain, harmful impacts of abortion on the women involved,\\n\\n\\x0c41a\\nI.\\n\\nProhibited Reasons for Abortion of Nonviable Fetuses\\n\\nThe most challenging and novel of the issues in\\nthis case is the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to prohibit all\\nabortions (including those of non-viable fetuses) for\\nspecial reasons that are deemed contrary to public\\npolicy. Mo. Rev. Stat. \\xc2\\xa7 188.038, effective August 28,\\n2019. The State would prohibit a pregnant woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nfavoritism of males, for instance, or apparently\\nhealthy prospective infants while choosing to abort\\nfetuses with disfavored characteristics. For present\\npurposes I assume that almost everyone in our\\nculture would be appalled by a pregnant woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nabortion of a fetus identified as female because the\\nwoman or the family preferred that she give birth to\\na boy. The legal issue is whether the public, through\\nlegislation, has a right to intervene and prohibit\\nsuch a discriminatory or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cselective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d abortion of a\\nfetus before viability. Plaintiffs do not challenge the\\nvalidity of the prohibitions after viability, which\\nheartbeat\\ntiming,\\nethical\\nconsiderations,\\nworldwide\\nrestrictions earlier than viability, progress in evaluating early\\ndevelopment, etc.. While these considerations might be\\nconsidered pertinent by the Supreme Court in reevaluating\\nabortion jurisprudence, they do not free the lower federal\\ncourts from standards previously established by that Court. A\\npanel of the Eighth Circuit that advocated reconsideration by\\nthe Supreme Court of its abortion jurisprudence nevertheless\\nacknowledged it was compelled to reject such reasons for\\nchanging pertinent law. MKB Management Corp. v Stenehjem,\\n795 F.3d 768, 773 (8th Cir. 2015). As discussed below, the\\ncurrent ruling turns on two questions of law announced by a\\nmajority of the Supreme Court, as it was constituted when\\nJustice Kennedy retired \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that is, the viability test and the\\ncategorical right of women seeking abortions of non-viable\\nfetuses.\\n\\n\\x0c42a\\nduplicated existing law. Under existing Missouri\\nlaw, no viable fetuses can be aborted, unless\\nrequired by the woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s health. Mo. Rev. Stat.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 188.030.\\nThe Supreme Court has not dealt with the merits\\nof this question. Earlier this year, however, it\\ndeclined to review a Seventh Circuit ruling that did\\nprevent Indiana from restricting a discriminatory\\nchoice by pregnant women in that State. Box v.\\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.,\\n139 S. Ct. 1780 (2019). The Court described the\\nlegislation as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbarring the knowing provision of sex, race-, or disability-selective abortions by abortion\\nproviders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1781. The denial of certiorari was\\nexplained by the novelty of the legal issues, which\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chave not been considered by additional Courts of\\nAppeals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1782. The concurrence by Justice\\nThomas demonstrated great interest in the ultimate\\nquestion of a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority, in his phrasing, to\\nprevent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabortion from becoming a tool of modernday eugenics,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d citing the recent State laws seeking\\nto prevent abortions motivated by race, sex, genetic\\nabnormality, and Down Syndrome. Id. at 1783.4\\n4 There is apparently much popular interest in this phase of\\nthe new legislation. See frontpage article in the Kansas City\\nStar of August 4, 2019, with the sub-head, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMissouri law denies\\nabortion for fatal (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfetal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d?) disorders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But the record here\\nsuggests that the proposed prohibition of certain controversial\\nabortions affects only a small number of non-viable fetus\\nabortions. Opening up the subject for legislation could,\\nhowever, logically reach more common reasons for early\\nabortions, such as the prospective illegitimacy of babies born\\nto unmarried girls and women. Illegitimacy being a frequently\\ndisfavored status, perhaps it may be treated as comparable to\\nhealth issues or disfavored sex or race characteristics. While\\nthere is no known legislation to protect the prospectively\\n\\n\\x0c43a\\nThe panel opinion in the Indiana case that was\\ndenied certiorari stated simply that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe nondiscriminatory provisions clearly violate wellestablished Supreme Court precedent holding that a\\nwoman may terminate her pregnancy prior to\\nviability, and that the State may not prohibit a\\nwoman from exercising that right for any reason.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc.\\nv. Commissioner of the Indiana State Dep\\xe2\\x80\\x99t of\\nHealth, 888 F.3d 300, 302 (7th Cir. 2018)\\n(emphasis added). Judge Manion, expressing\\ndissatisfaction, agreed that Supreme Court\\nprecedent invalidated the abortion motivation\\nprohibition that Indiana sought to impose, but only\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause I have no choice but to follow Supreme\\nCourt precedent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 316.\\nThe recent Arkansas decision reaches the same\\nconclusion, for the same reason. That is the result\\nreached by other federal court judges who have ruled\\nthe question. In the district court case affirmed by\\nthe Seventh Circuit, the ruling stated that under\\nexisting law, as established by the Supreme Court,\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to choose to terminate a pregnancy\\npre-viability is categorical.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Planned Parenthood of\\nInd. & Ky., Inc. v. Comm\\xe2\\x80\\x99r, Indiana State Dep\\xe2\\x80\\x99t of\\nHealth, 265 F. Supp. 3d 859, 866 (S.D. Ind. 2017).\\nIn Preterm-Cleveland v. Himes, 294 F. Supp. 3d 746\\n(S.D. Ohio 2018), the Indiana case was relied on to\\nreach the same result. Preterm has been appealed\\nand was argued in the Sixth Circuit in January,\\nillegitimate, such legislation for non-viable fetuses could be\\nlegally evaluated similarly to the issues here. We are thus\\ndealing with a potentially large problem, numerically as well\\nas intrinsically important.\\n\\n\\x0c44a\\n2019. Little Rock Family Services, supra, at p. 36.\\nSignificant rulings on this issue may be imminent.\\nAlthough other Supreme Court language is\\nrelied on to invalidate any prohibition of previability abortions, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cessential holding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d most\\nquoted is from the plurality opinion in Planned\\nParenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania v. Casey,\\n505 U.S. 833, 846 (1992), containing the rule that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]efore viability, the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests are not\\nstrong enough to support a prohibition of abortion or\\nthe imposition of a substantial obstacle to the\\nwoman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effective right to elect the procedure.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d It\\nwas repeated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca Statemay not prohibit any woman\\nfrom making the ultimate decision to terminate her\\npregnancy before viability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 879. Thus, cases\\nto date have accepted the woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cultimate\\ndecision\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and have rejected prohibitions of certain\\nreasons for the decision.\\nDissatisfaction has been voiced, as noted,\\nperhaps most meaningfully by Judge Easterbrook in\\ndissenting from the Seventh Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close vote\\ndenying a rehearing en banc in the Indiana case.\\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky Inc. v.\\nCommissioner of the Indiana State Dept of Health,\\n917 F.3d 532 (2018). He argued that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJudges often\\nsaid that employers could fire workers for any or no\\nreason,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and thereafter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregularly created\\nexceptions when the discharge was based on race,\\nsex, or disability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 536. Of course Supreme\\nCourt justices sometimes overstate principles, and\\nthen reword the rules. But an appellate court that\\nmodifies a rule is appropriately the court that\\nannounced the rule. Lower court judges do not often\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the language of the Supreme Court. While\\n\\n\\x0c45a\\nit can be speculated that the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlanguage in Box implicitly invited appellate judges\\nto review the merits of prohibitions of\\ndiscriminatory abortions, any such invitation was\\nnot addressed to district judges.\\nThere are no pertinent factual disputes on this\\naspect of the case. For present purposes I assume,\\nin accordance with declarations offered by the\\nMissouri defendants, that there are adequate\\npublic policy reasons to adopt the prohibitions\\nagainst aborting fetuses because they are\\ndisfavored by the pregnant woman on grounds of\\nsex, race or Down Syndrome likelihood. I recognize\\nthat a Down Syndrome abortion is a very\\ndebatable subject, but it would likely be a\\nlegislative issue rather than a judicial issue if\\nabortion jurisprudence, as established by the\\nSupreme Court, permitted a legislative override of\\nany aspect of a woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to abort a non-viable\\nfetus. All judicial rulings so far preclude such a\\nlegislative override in this context. It is clear today\\nthat plaintiffs are likely to prevail in striking down\\nthe prohibited reasons law, insofar as it applies to\\nnon-viable fetuses.\\nAnother legal point remains. The Missouri\\ndefendants argue that relief from a regulation of\\nabortion cannot be obtained unless the statute\\nimposes an undue burden on a large fraction of\\nwomen seeking an abortion. E.g., Planned\\nParenthood of Arkansas & Eastern Oklahoma v.\\nJegley, 864 F.3d 953 (8th Cir. 2017). The courts that\\nhave dealt with such an issue in cases like the\\npresent one, however, have limited that test to\\nstatutes that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d abortion practice, not cases\\n\\n\\x0c46a\\nlike this one that impose a complete prohibition of\\ncertain classes of abortions for non-viable fetuses.\\nEdwards v. Beck, 786 F.3d 1113 (8th Cir. 2015),\\nruled that the State cannot recharacterize a ban as\\na regulation, and thus lighten its obligation to\\nrespect the rights of pregnant women, as\\nrepresented by providers. Id. at 1117. See also the\\nsame rationale in Isaacson v. Horne, 716 F.3d 1213,\\n1225 (9th Cir. 2013). In any event, at the\\npreliminary injunction stage, the issue is whether\\nplaintiffs are likely to prevail. With existing law as\\nreviewed above, plaintiffs easily pass that test. But,\\nas discussed below, that is not the only factor to be\\nconsidered in exercising judicial discretion to grant\\nor withhold a preliminary injunction.\\nII.\\n\\nProhibition of Abortions after 20 or\\nFewer Weeks\\n\\nHouse Bill 126 attempts to make a second major\\nchange in abortion law\\xe2\\x80\\x94it limits abortions after 8\\nweeks from the patient\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last menstrual period\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLMP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). If this is deemed constitutionallyforbidden,\\nthe weeks are extended to 14, then 18, and finally\\n20. Because viability has never occurred that early,\\nso it is understood,5 the effect of the legislation is to\\n5 Plaintiff\\nReproductive Health Services of Planned\\nParenthood of the St Louis Region (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRHS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) uses 21 weeks and\\n6 days LMP as its guideline for providing pre-viability surgical\\nabortions. McNicholas Decl. \\xc2\\xa7 25. Doc. 3. This is consistent\\nwith the cases cited by the Eighth Circuit, where the current\\nrecords of newborn infant survival have not reached below 21\\nor 22 weeks. MKB Management Corp. v. Stenehjem, 795 F.3d\\n768, 773 (8th Cir 2015). The Missouri authorities have not\\nasserted that RHS has been violating the current prohibition\\nof abortions of viable fetuses.\\n\\n\\x0c47a\\ncut back the viability test, as adopted by the\\nSupreme Court in Casey. The Little Rock ruling on\\nAugust 6 prohibits enforcement during litigation of\\nvery similar legislation in that State, although\\nArkansas stops at 18 rather than 20 weeks. However\\nformulated, the legislation on its face conflicts with\\nthe Supreme Court ruling that neither legislative\\nnor judicial limits on abortion can be measured by\\nspecified weeks of development of a fetus; instead,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cviability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the sole test for a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority to\\nprohibit abortions where there is no maternal health\\nissue. That is the lesson of Casey, previously\\nquoted, as widely recognized by the lower courts,\\nincluding the Eighth Circuit. See also, the\\nconcurrence of Justice O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connor in Webster v.\\nReproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 528\\n(1989) (where testing at 20 weeks was permissibly\\nrequired), repeating the language of Colautti v.\\nFranklin, 439 U.S. 379, 388\\xe2\\x80\\x9389 (1979), that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98neither\\nthe legislature nor the courts may proclaim one of\\nthe elements entering into the assessment of\\nviability\\xe2\\x80\\x94be it weeks of gestation \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 or any other\\nsingle factor\\xe2\\x80\\x94 as the determinant of when the\\nState has a compelling interest in the life or health\\nof the fetus. Viability is the crucial point.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(emphasis added). The Missouri General Assembly\\nhas just done what Justice O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Connor declared is\\nimpermissible.\\nThe Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prohibition on a State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nselecting a specific fetal age where abortion could be\\nprohibited has been enforced in many cases,\\nincluding the Little Rock case. A 20-week limit has\\nbeen struck down in several. Bryant v. Woodall,\\n363 F. Supp. 3d 611 (M.D.N.Car. 2019) (appealed\\n6/26/2019); McCormack v.

Utah.\\n1992) (appealed on other issues).\\nIt is thus highly likely that the listed weekly time\\nlimits on abortions will be ruled invalid in the final\\njudgment in this case.\\nIII.\\n\\nPreliminary\\nIssues.\\n\\nInjunction\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nIn addition to evaluating likelihood of success in\\nobtaining a permanent injunction, I must consider\\nthe threat of irreparable harm to plaintiffs and\\npatients if the challenged provisions of Bill 126 go\\ninto effect this week, the balance of harm to the\\nparties if preliminary relief is granted, and the\\npublic interest. Dataphase Sys. Inc. v. C L Sys. Inc.,\\n640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981). I need also\\nconsider whether preservation of the status quo\\nwould be served by granting interim relief.\\nEnjoining new legislation pending litigation and\\nbefore the effective date seems to be a method of\\npreserving the status quo during the pendency\\nof\\nthe\\nlawsuit.\\nAssociation of Equipment\\nManufacturers v. Burgum, 2017 WL 8791104\\n(D.N.Dak.). While federal courts should generally\\nbe very cautious before delaying the effect of State\\nlaws, the sense of caution may be mitigated when\\nthe legislation seems designed, as here, as a protest\\nagainst Supreme Court decisions.\\nThe hostility to, and refusal to comply with, the\\nSupreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abortion jurisprudence is most\\nobviously demonstrated in the attempt to push\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cviability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d protection downward in various weekly\\n\\n\\x0c49a\\nstages to 8 weeks LMP. This is contrary to repeated,\\nclear language of the Court. The anti-discrimination\\nsection seeks to create novel exceptions to some\\nplain but general language. That is a less\\nquestionable legislative practice. It does seem so\\nlikely wrong, however, that it should not be\\npermitted to go into operation, unless the relief\\nsought offers minimal demonstrable practical\\nbenefit \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or, in other words, the denial of immediate\\nrelief is not demonstrably harmful.\\nThe greatest impact of House Bill 126 would be\\nto prohibit abortions in Missouri after 8 weeks LMP.\\nThis would prohibit more than two thirds of plaintiff\\nRHS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients from obtaining abortions and about\\nhalf the reported abortions in Missouri. McNicholas\\nDecl. \\xc2\\xb6 52. Crumbliss Decl. \\xc2\\xb6 14. Docs. 3 & 35. The\\nimpact of the 20-week rule seems likely to prohibit\\nabout 100 abortions performed each year.\\nMcNicholas Decl. \\xc2\\xa7 52. I classify that as a\\nsignificant interference with plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 service and\\nthe rights of its prospective patients, so it should be\\nconsidered quite adequate as harm to justify\\nimmediate relief from the defective provisions of\\nHouse Bill 126. The least impact would result from\\nprohibiting the sex or race reasons for an abortion,\\nthe occurrence of which is unknown to the Chief\\nMedical Officer of RHS. McNicholas Decl. \\xc2\\xa7 59. An\\nabortion before viability motivated by a Down\\nSyndrome test would also be somewhat rare, given\\nthe window of time needed for adequate testing\\nand consultation. Bebbington Decl. \\xc2\\xa7\\xc2\\xa7 9, 22\\xe2\\x80\\x9324, 43.\\nAnd we do not know the frequency of those abortions\\nin Missouri, where the testing rate might be greater\\nor below testing elsewhere.\\n\\n\\x0c50a\\nThere is an absence of any information from RHS\\nthat would allow me to assess whether, if final\\njudgment is possible in several months, the inability\\nto schedule \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown syndrome abortions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would be\\nlikely to interfere with the abortion rights of real-life\\nwomen. I asked counsel early in the morning of\\nargument, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy is there neither a disclaimer nor an\\nestimate of \\xe2\\x80\\x98Down Syndrome abortions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 at RHS?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis issue remains entirely speculative after\\nargument, perhaps because no estimate is possible,\\nsince Down Syndrome is rarely mentioned by\\npatients. If so, there could be no sanctions, since the\\nlaw requires knowledge before a provider is in\\nviolation.6 Caution suggests I withhold a\\npreliminary\\ninjunction\\nagainst\\nthe\\nantidiscrimination section, but remain open to an\\nadequately supported renewed motion on this\\nnarrow issue.7\\n\\nPlaintiffs complain that this provision will, if ultimately\\nvalidated by the courts, cause them to engage in inappropriate,\\nintrusive discussions with women seeking abortions. But one\\ncan imagine that if there is a legally validated prohibition,\\nproviders would protect themselves by adding to medical\\npaperwork a question such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIs this procedure being sought\\nbecause of race, sex or Down syndrome?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One would guess this\\nwould lead to the effective discontinuance of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDown syndrome\\nabortions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at RHS. Until there is finality on the legal issue,\\nwhich currently tilts in favor of plaintiffs, one might suppose\\nfewer questions would be asked, since they are not required,\\nand that the status quo could be preserved without court order.\\nAt least this may be true for the next several months, which\\nwould diminish the likelihood of harm from denial of a\\npreliminary injunction. If my supposition is mistaken, a\\nfurther motion can be filed.\\n6\\n\\n7 The related issue of ripeness will apparently be the subject\\nof further briefing. Doc. 33,p 12.\\n\\n\\x0c51a\\nIn plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reply brief (Doc. 47) they candidly\\nchange the emphasis to perceived harm that\\ncompliance might cause RHS and its officials and\\nmedical personnel. They suggest criminal penalties\\nor loss of licenses. Prosecutions seem even more\\nspeculative or unlikely than the possible loss of an\\nabortion opportunity during the next several\\nmonths by some pregnant woman and her family.\\nThe St. Louis Circuit Attorney, a named defendant,\\ndoes not oppose plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 request for a preliminary\\ninjunction. Doc. 42, noted in Doc. 47, p. 1. License\\ncontroversies on this subject also seem entirely\\nunlikely. Both this court and the State Courts are\\nopen to RHS or any other target of a license\\ncancellation. Unlike many individuals who seek\\nabortions, legal assistance seems available, and the\\nviews expressed here should reduce the likelihood\\nof harassment issues concerning the antidiscrimination section.\\nThe public interest in this case at this time\\nseems dominated by the analysis of which party is\\nlikely to prevail, which overwhelmingly favors\\nplaintiffs, and\\nseems unlikely to change\\ndramatically in the next several months; that is,\\nbefore final judgment can be entered.8 A\\nThe apparent absence of material facts that are in dispute\\nsuggests that summary judgment may be the most expeditious\\nway to advance this case toward an appeal.\\n8\\n\\nIn offering this procedural suggestion I am aware that the\\nMissouri brief proposes slowing the case for development and\\nconsideration of a factual record, advising that last Monday it\\nsubmitted extensive newly developed evidence. Doc. 35.\\nMissouri has offered material for the record (and perhaps\\nappellate or Supreme Court consideration) regarding the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscrimination\\xe2\\x80\\x9d issues. There is also a good deal of material\\n\\n\\x0c52a\\npreliminary injunction in favor of plaintiffs is\\nappropriate here, except as to \\xc2\\xa7 188.038, the antidiscrimination section.\\nIV.\\n\\nSeverability and Conditions\\n\\nThe Missouri General Assembly has made clear\\nthat it wishes to preserve as much of House Bill 126\\nas can be saved under current law. The various\\nsections specifying prohibitions on abortions at\\nvarious weeks prior to viability cannot be allowed to\\ngo into effect on August 28, as scheduled. The\\nexisting prohibition against abortion of viable\\nfetuses remains in effect, and is not challenged, so\\na preliminary injunction leaves Missouri with a\\n\\nrelating to fetus development and other issues outlined in Doc.\\n31. But the two basic issues regarding (1) restricting reasons\\nfor exercising abortion rights before viability and (2) banning\\nabortions at various weekly stages before viability seemingly\\npresent pure legal questions. Both prohibitions very likely\\nconflict with current abortion jurisprudence. Because I was the\\ndistrict judge in the Hawley case, supra, and because the\\nMissouri defendants seek to equate the need for factual\\ndevelopment in that case with this one, I note that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfactual\\nissues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d here and there are unrelated. Here I express the view,\\nwith other judges, that certain Supreme Court legal rulings are\\nbinding. In Hawley, on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfactual issues\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I was of the view\\nthat certain Supreme Court factual rulings on \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegislative\\nfacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial facts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were binding, and could not be relitigated\\nat the district court. See Doc. 113 in Case 16-4313. For\\nillustration, I quoted Judge Easterbrook that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter a majority\\nof the Supreme Court has concluded that photo ID\\nrequirements promote confidence, a single district judge\\ncannot say as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98fact\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that they do not even if 20 political\\nscientists disagree with the Supreme Court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Avoidance of facts\\nhere is thus in a different context, that is, whether a legal\\nprinciple established by the Supreme Court can be rebutted by\\nfactual material offered in the lower courts.\\n\\n\\x0c53a\\npublic policy against abortions to the extent\\npermitted by Constitutional law.\\nThe statutory prohibition of discriminatory or\\nselective abortions is unqualified, thus applying to\\nboth viable and non-viable fetuses. If it were possible\\nto sever the language to limit the coverage to viable\\nfetuses I would do so, but that cannot be done\\nwithout judicial re-writing of the section, a practice\\nto be avoided when possible. The desired result could\\nbe achieved, however, by using an as applied rather\\nthan a comprehensive injunction. A full facial\\nchallenge is not appropriate here because RHS\\nlimits its practice to non-viable fetus abortions (21\\nweeks, 6 days, LMP).\\nAs is customary in cases of this nature, and\\nconsistently with Rule 65 (c), Fed. R. Civ. Proc., no\\nbond will be required from plaintiffs in this case.\\nLittle Rock Family Planning Services, supra, 2019\\nWL 3679623, at * 90.\\nIt is therefore ORDERED that the Missouri\\nofficial defendants, their employees, agents, and\\nsuccessors in office are hereby PROHIBITED,\\npending litigation or further order of the court, from\\nenforcing certain pre-viability bans on abortions,\\npursuant to H.B. 126; specifically, Mo.

Missouri Stands for the Unborn Act \\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nfindings of general assembly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 interests of the\\nstate of Missouri. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1. This section and sections\\n188.056, 188.057, and 188.058 shall be known and\\nmay be cited as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMissouri Stands for the Unborn\\nAct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\n2. In Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), certain\\ninformation about the development of the unborn\\nchild, human pregnancy, and the effects of abortion\\nwas either not part of the record or was not available\\nat the time. Since 1973, advances in medical and\\nscientific technology have greatly expanded our\\nknowledge of prenatal life and the effects of abortion\\non women. The general assembly of this state finds:\\n(1) At conception, a new genetically distinct\\nhuman being is formed;\\n(2) The fact that the life of an individual human\\nbeing begins at conception has long been recognized in\\nMissouri law: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]he child is, in truth, alive from the\\nmoment of conception\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. State v. Emerich, 13 Mo. App.\\n492, 495 (1883), affirmed, 87 Mo. 110 (1885). Under\\nsection 1.205, the general assembly has recognized\\nthat the life of each human being begins at conception\\nand that unborn children have protectable interests in\\nlife, health, and well-being;\\n(3) The first prohibition of abortion in Missouri\\nwas enacted in 1825. Since then, the repeal and\\nreenactment of prohibitions of abortion have made\\ndistinctions with respect to penalties for performing\\nor inducing abortion on the basis of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquickening\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\n\\n\\x0c58a\\nhowever, the unborn child was still protected from\\nconception onward;\\n(4) In ruling that Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prohibition on\\nabortion was constitutional in 1972, the Missouri\\nsupreme court accepted as a stipulation of the parties\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98[i]nfant Doe, Intervenor Defendant in this case,\\nand all other unborn children have all the qualities\\nand attributes of adult human persons differing only\\nin age or maturity. Medically, human life is a\\ncontinuum from conception to death.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rodgers v.\\nDanforth, 486 S.W.2d 258, 259 (1972);\\n(5) In Webster v. Reproductive Health Services,\\n492 U.S. 490 (1989), the Supreme Court, while\\nconsidering the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreamble\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that set forth \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfindings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in\\nsection 1.205, stated: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe think the extent to which\\nthe preamble\\xe2\\x80\\x99s language might be used to interpret\\nother state statutes or regulations is something that\\nonly the courts of Missouri can definitively decide.\\nState law has offered protections to unborn children\\nin tort and probate law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Id. at 506. Since Webster,\\nMissouri courts have construed section 1.205 and\\nhave consistently found that an unborn child is a\\nperson for purposes of Missouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s homicide and\\nassault laws when the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mother was\\nkilled or assaulted by another person. Section 1.205\\nhas even been found applicable to the manslaughter\\nof an unborn child who was eight weeks gestational\\nage or earlier. State v. Harrison, 390 S.W.3d 927 (Mo.\\nCt. App. 2013);\\n(6) In medicine, a special emphasis is placed on\\nthe heartbeat. The heartbeat is a discernible sign of\\nlife at every stage of human existence. During the\\nfifth week of gestational age, an unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heart\\n\\n\\x0c59a\\nbegins to beat and blood flow begins during the sixth\\nweek;\\n(7) Depending on the ultrasound equipment\\nbeing used, the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heartbeat can be\\nvisually detected as early as six to eight weeks\\ngestational age. By about twelve weeks gestational\\nage, the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s heartbeat can consistently be\\nmade audible through the use of a handheld Doppler\\nfetal heart rate device;\\n(8)\\nConfirmation of a pregnancy can be\\nindicated through the detection of the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nheartbeat, while the absence of a heartbeat can be an\\nindicator of the death of the unborn child if the child\\nhas reached the point of development when a\\nheartbeat should be detectable;\\n(9) Heart rate monitoring during pregnancy\\nand labor is utilized to measure the heart rate and\\nrhythm of the unborn child, at an average rate\\nbetween one hundred ten and one hundred sixty beats\\nper minute, and helps determine the health of the\\nunborn child;\\n(10) The Supreme Court in Roe discussed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\ndifficult question of when life begins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and wrote:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[p]hysicians and their scientific colleagues have\\nregarded [quickening] with less interest and have\\ntended to focus either upon conception, upon live\\nbirth, or upon the interim point at which the fetus\\nbecomes \\xe2\\x80\\x98viable\\xe2\\x80\\x99, that is, potentially able to live\\noutside the mother\\xe2\\x80\\x99s womb, albeit with artificial aid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nRoe, 410 U.S. at 160. Today, however, physicians\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\nscientists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests on life in the womb also focus on\\nother markers of development in the unborn child,\\nincluding, but not limited to, presence of a heartbeat,\\nbrain development, a viable pregnancy or viable\\n\\n\\x0c60a\\nintrauterine pregnancy during the first trimester of\\npregnancy, and the ability to experience pain;\\n(11)\\nIn Planned Parenthood of Central\\nMissouri v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52 (1976), the Supreme\\nCourt noted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe recognized in Roe that viability\\nwas a matter of medical judgment, skill, and technical\\nability, and we preserved the flexibility of the term\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nId. at 64. Due to advances in medical technology and\\ndiagnoses, present-day physicians and scientists now\\ndescribe the viability of an unborn child in an\\nadditional manner, by determining whether there is a\\nviable pregnancy or viable intrauterine pregnancy\\nduring the first trimester of pregnancy;\\n(12) While the overall risk of miscarriage after\\nclinical recognition of pregnancy is twelve to fifteen\\npercent, the incidence decreases significantly if\\ncardiac activity in the unborn child has been\\nconfirmed. The detection of a heartbeat in an unborn\\nchild is a reliable indicator of a viable pregnancy and\\nthat the unborn child will likely survive to birth,\\nespecially if presenting for a prenatal visit at eight\\nweeks gestational age or later. For asymptomatic\\nwomen attending a first prenatal visit between six\\nand eleven weeks gestational age where a heartbeat\\nwas confirmed through an ultrasound, the subsequent\\nrisk of miscarriage is one and six-tenths percent.\\nAlthough the risk is higher at six weeks gestational\\nage at nine and four-tenths percent, it declines rapidly\\nto one and five-tenths percent at eight weeks\\ngestational age, and less than one percent at nine\\nweeks gestational age or later;\\n(13) The presence of a heartbeat in an unborn\\nchild represents a more definable point of\\nascertaining survivability than the ambiguous\\n\\n\\x0c61a\\nconcept of viability that has been adopted by the\\nSupreme Court, especially since if a heartbeat is\\ndetected at eight weeks gestational age or later in a\\nnormal pregnancy, there is likely to be a viable\\npregnancy and there is a high probability that the\\nunborn child will survive to birth;\\n(14) The placenta begins developing during the\\nearly first trimester of pregnancy and performs a\\nrespiratory function by making oxygen supply to and\\ncarbon dioxide removal from the unborn child possible\\nlater in the first trimester and throughout the second\\nand third trimesters of pregnancy;\\n(15) By the fifth week of gestation, the\\ndevelopment of the brain of the unborn child is\\nunderway. Brain waves have been measured and\\nrecorded as early as the eighth week of gestational age\\nin children who were removed during an ectopic\\npregnancy or hysterectomy.\\nFetal magnetic\\nresonance imaging (MRI) of an unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brain is\\nused during the second and third trimesters of\\npregnancy and brain activity has been observed using\\nMRI;\\n(16) Missouri law identifies the presence of\\ncirculation, respiration, and brain function as indicia\\nof life under section 194.005, as the presence of\\ncirculation, respiration, and brain function indicates\\nthat such person is not legally dead, but is legally\\nalive;\\n(17)\\nUnborn children at eight weeks\\ngestational age show spontaneous movements, such\\nas a twitching of the trunk and developing limbs. It\\nhas been reported that unborn children at this stage\\nshow reflex responses to touch. The perioral area is\\nthe first part of the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body to respond to\\n\\n\\x0c62a\\ntouch at about eight weeks gestational age and by\\nfourteen weeks gestational age most of the unborn\\nchild\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body is responsive to touch;\\n(18) Peripheral cutaneous sensory receptors,\\nthe receptors that feel pain, develop early in the\\nunborn child. They appear in the perioral cutaneous\\narea at around seven to eight weeks gestational age,\\nin the palmar regions at ten to ten and a half weeks\\ngestational age, the abdominal wall at fifteen weeks\\ngestational age, and over all of the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s body\\nat sixteen weeks gestational age;\\n(19) Substance P, a peptide that functions as a\\nneurotransmitter, especially in the transmission of\\npain, is present in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord of\\nthe unborn child at eight to ten weeks gestational age.\\nEnkephalins, peptides that play a role in\\nneurotransmission and pain modulation, are present\\nin the dorsal horn at twelve to fourteen weeks\\ngestational age;\\n(20) When intrauterine needling is performed\\non an unborn child at sixteen weeks gestational age or\\nlater, the reaction to this invasive stimulus is blood\\nflow redistribution to the brain. Increased blood flow\\nto the brain is the same type of stress response seen\\nin a born child and an adult;\\n(21) By sixteen weeks gestational age, pain\\ntransmission from a peripheral receptor to the cortex\\nis possible in the unborn child;\\n(22) Physicians provide anesthesia during in\\nutero treatment of unborn children as early as sixteen\\nweeks gestational age for certain procedures,\\nincluding those to correct fetal urinary tract\\nobstruction.\\nAnesthesia is administered by\\n\\n\\x0c63a\\nultrasound-guided injection into the arm or leg of the\\nunborn child;\\n(23)\\nA leading textbook on prenatal\\ndevelopment of the human brain states, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt may be\\nconcluded that, although nociperception (the actual\\nperception of pain) awaits the appearance of\\nconsciousness, nociception (the experience of pain) is\\npresent some time before birth. In the absence of\\ndisproof, it is merely prudent to assume that pain can\\nbe experienced even early in prenatal life (Dr. J.\\nWisser, Z\\xc3\\xbcrich): the fetus should be given the benefit\\nof the doubt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Ronan O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Rahilly & Fabiola M\\xc3\\xbcller. The\\nEmbryonic Human Brain: An Atlas of Developmental\\nStages (3d ed. 2005);\\n(24) By fourteen or fifteen weeks gestational\\nage or later, the predominant abortion method in\\nMissouri is dilation and evacuation (D&E). The D&E\\nabortion method includes the dismemberment,\\ndisarticulation, and exsanguination of the unborn\\nchild, causing the unborn child\\xe2\\x80\\x99s death;\\n(25) The Supreme Court acknowledged in\\nGonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 160 (2007), that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe standard D&E is in some respects as brutal, if not\\nmore, than the intact D&E\\xe2\\x80\\x9d partial birth abortion\\nmethod banned by Congress and upheld as facially\\nconstitutional by the Supreme Court, even though the\\nfederal ban was applicable both before and after\\nviability and had no exception for the health of the\\nmother;\\n(26)\\nMissouri\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban on the partial birth\\nabortion method, section 565.300, is in effect because\\nof Gonzales v. Carhart and the Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsubsequent decision in Nixon v. Reproductive Health\\nServices of Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis\\n\\n\\x0c64a\\nRegion, Inc., 550 U.S. 901 (2007), to vacate and\\nremand to the appellate court the prior invalidation of\\nsection 565.300. Since section 565.300, like Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nban on partial birth abortion, is applicable both before\\nand after viability, there is ample precedent for the\\ngeneral assembly to constitutionally prohibit the\\nbrutal D&E abortion method at fourteen weeks\\ngestational age or later, even before the unborn child\\nis viable, with a medical emergency exception;\\n(27) In Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551 (2005),\\nthe Supreme Court determined that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevolving\\nstandards of decency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d dictated that a Missouri statute\\nallowing the death penalty for a conviction of murder\\nin the first degree for a person under eighteen years\\nof age when the crime was committed was\\nunconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth\\nAmendments to the United States Constitution\\nbecause it violated the prohibition against \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccruel and\\nunusual punishments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\n(28) In Bucklew v. Precythe, 139 S. Ct. 1112,\\n1123 (2019), the Supreme Court noted that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98[d]isgusting\\xe2\\x80\\x99 practices\\xe2\\x80\\x9d like disemboweling and\\nquartering \\xe2\\x80\\x9creadily qualified as \\xe2\\x80\\x98cruel and unusual\\xe2\\x80\\x99, as\\na reader at the time of the Eighth Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nadoption would have understood those words\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\n(29) Evolving standards of decency dictate that\\nMissouri should prohibit the brutal and painful D&E\\nabortion method at fourteen weeks gestational age or\\nlater, with a medical emergency exception, because if\\na comparable method of killing was used on:\\n(a) A person convicted of murder in the first\\ndegree, it would be cruel and unusual punishment; or\\n\\n\\x0c65a\\n(b) An animal, it would be unlawful under state\\nlaw because it would not be a humane method,\\nhumane euthanasia, or humane killing of certain\\nanimals under chapters 273 and 578;\\n(30) In Roper, the Supreme Court also found\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]t is proper that we acknowledge the\\noverwhelming weight of international opinion against\\nthe juvenile death penalty.... The opinion of the world\\ncommunity, while not controlling our outcome, does\\nprovide respected and significant confirmation for our\\nown conclusions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Roper, 543 U.S. at 578. In its\\nopinion, the Supreme Court was instructed by\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinternational covenants prohibiting the juvenile\\ndeath penalty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, such as the International Covenant on\\nCivil and Political Rights, 999 U.N.T.S. 171. Id. at\\n577;\\n(31) The opinion of the world community,\\nreflected in the laws of the United Nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 193member states and six other entities, is that in most\\ncountries, most abortions are prohibited after twelve\\nweeks gestational age or later;\\n(32) The opinion of the world community is also\\nshared by most Americans, who believe that most\\nabortions in the second and third trimesters of\\npregnancy should be illegal, based on polling that has\\nremained consistent since 1996;\\n(33) Abortion procedures performed later in\\npregnancy have a higher medical risk for women.\\nCompared to an abortion at eight weeks gestational\\nage or earlier, the relative risk increases\\nexponentially at later gestational ages. The relative\\nrisk of death for a pregnant woman who had an\\nabortion performed or induced upon her at:\\n\\n\\x0c66a\\n(a) Eleven to twelve weeks gestational age is\\nbetween three and four times higher than an abortion\\nat eight weeks gestational age or earlier;\\n(b) Thirteen to fifteen weeks gestational age is\\nalmost fifteen times higher than an abortion at eight\\nweeks gestational age or earlier;\\n(c) Sixteen to twenty weeks gestational age is\\nalmost thirty times higher than an abortion at eight\\nweeks gestational age or earlier; and\\n(d) Twenty-one weeks gestational age or later\\nis more than seventy-five times higher than an\\nabortion at eight weeks gestational age or earlier;\\n(34) In addition to the short-term risks of an\\nabortion, studies have found that the long-term\\nphysical and psychological consequences of abortion\\nfor women include, but are not limited to, an increased\\nrisk of preterm birth, low birthweight babies, and\\nplacenta previa in subsequent pregnancies, as well as\\nserious behavioral health issues. These risks increase\\nas abortions are performed or induced at later\\ngestational ages. These consequences of an abortion\\nhave a detrimental effect not only on women, their\\nchildren, and their families, but also on an already\\nburdened health care system, taxpayers, and the\\nworkforce;\\n(35) A large percentage of women who have an\\nabortion performed or induced upon them in Missouri\\neach year are at less than eight weeks gestational age,\\na large majority are at less than fourteen weeks\\ngestational age, a larger majority are at less than\\neighteen weeks gestational age, and an even larger\\nmajority are at less than twenty weeks gestational\\nage. A prohibition on performing or inducing an\\n\\n\\x0c67a\\nabortion at eight weeks gestational age or later, with\\na medical emergency exception, does not amount to a\\nsubstantial obstacle to a large fraction of women for\\nwhom the prohibition is relevant, which is pregnant\\nwomen in Missouri who are seeking an abortion while\\nnot experiencing a medical emergency. The burden\\nthat a prohibition on performing or inducing an\\nabortion at eight, fourteen, eighteen, or twenty weeks\\ngestational age or later, with a medical emergency\\nexception, might impose on abortion access, is\\noutweighed by the benefits conferred upon the\\nfollowing:\\n(a) Women more advanced in pregnancy who\\nare at greater risk of harm from abortion;\\n(b)\\nUnborn children at later stages of\\ndevelopment;\\n(c) The medical profession, by preserving its\\nintegrity and fulfilling its commitment to do no harm;\\nand\\n(d) Society, by fostering respect for human life,\\nborn and unborn, at all stages of development, and by\\nlessening societal tolerance of violence against\\ninnocent human life;\\n(36) In Webster, the Supreme Court noted, in\\nupholding a Missouri statute, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat there may be a 4week error in estimating gestational age\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Webster,\\n492 U.S. at 516. Thus, an unborn child thought to be\\neight weeks gestational age might in fact be twelve\\nweeks gestational age, when an abortion poses a\\ngreater risk to the woman and the unborn child is\\nconsiderably more developed. An unborn child at\\nfourteen weeks gestational age might be eighteen\\nweeks gestational age and an unborn child at eighteen\\n\\n\\x0c68a\\nweeks gestational age might be twenty-two weeks\\ngestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk\\nto the woman, the unborn child is considerably more\\ndeveloped, the abortion method likely to be employed\\nis more brutal, and the risk of pain experienced by the\\nunborn child is greater. An unborn child at twenty\\nweeks gestational age might be twenty-four weeks\\ngestational age, when an abortion poses a greater risk\\nto the woman, the unborn child is considerably more\\ndeveloped, the abortion method likely to be employed\\nis more brutal, the risk of pain experienced by the\\nunborn child is greater, and the unborn child may be\\nviable.\\n3. The state of Missouri is bound by Article VI, Clause\\n2 of the Constitution of the United States that \\xe2\\x80\\x9call\\ntreaties made, or which shall be made, under the\\nauthority of the United States, shall be the supreme\\nlaw of the land\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. One such treaty is the International\\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights, entered into\\nforce on March 23, 1976, and adopted by the United\\nStates on September 8, 1992. In ratifying the\\nCovenant, the United States declared that while the\\nprovisions of Articles 1 through 27 of the Covenant are\\nnot self-executing, the United States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 understanding\\nis that state governments share responsibility with\\nthe federal government in implementing the\\nCovenant.\\n4. Article 6, Paragraph 1, U.N.T.S. at 174, of the\\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights\\nstates, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEvery human being has the inherent right to\\nlife. This right shall be protected by law. No one shall\\nbe arbitrarily deprived of his life\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The state of\\nMissouri takes seriously its obligation to comply with\\nthe Covenant and to implement this paragraph as it\\nrelates to the inherent right to life of unborn human\\n\\n\\x0c69a\\nbeings, protecting the rights of unborn human beings\\nby law, and ensuring that such unborn human beings\\nare not arbitrarily deprived of life. The state of\\nMissouri hereby implements Article 6, Paragraph 1 of\\nthe Covenant by the regulation of abortion in this\\nstate.\\n5. The state of Missouri has interests that include,\\nbut are not limited to:\\n(1) Protecting unborn children throughout\\npregnancy and preserving and promoting their lives\\nfrom conception to birth;\\n(2) Encouraging childbirth over abortion;\\n(3) Ensuring respect for all human life from\\nconception to natural death;\\n(4) Safeguarding an unborn child from the\\nserious harm of pain by an abortion method that\\nwould cause the unborn child to experience pain while\\nshe or he is being killed;\\n(5) Preserving the integrity of the medical\\nprofession and regulating and restricting practices\\nthat might cause the medical profession or society as\\na whole to become insensitive, even disdainful, to life.\\nThis includes regulating and restricting abortion\\nmethods that are not only brutal and painful, but if\\nallowed to continue, will further coarsen society to the\\nhumanity of not only unborn children, but all\\nvulnerable and innocent human life, making it\\nincreasingly difficult to protect such life;\\n(6) Ending the incongruities in state law by\\npermitting some unborn children to be killed by\\nabortion, while requiring that unborn children be\\nprotected in nonabortion circumstances through,\\nincluding, but not limited to, homicide, assault, self-\\n\\n\\x0c70a\\ndefense, and defense of another statutes; laws\\nguaranteeing prenatal health care, emergency care,\\nand testing; state-sponsored health insurance for\\nunborn children; the prohibition of restraints in\\ncorrectional institutions to protect pregnant offenders\\nand their unborn children; and protecting the\\ninterests of unborn children by the appointment of\\nconservators, guardians, and representatives;\\n(7) Reducing the risks of harm to pregnant\\nwomen who obtain abortions later in pregnancy; and\\n(8) Avoiding burdens on the health care\\nsystem, taxpayers, and the workforce because of\\nincreased preterm births, low birthweight babies,\\ncompromised pregnancies, extended postpartum\\nrecoveries, and behavioral health problems caused by\\nthe long-term effects of abortions performed or\\ninduced later in the pregnancy.\\n\\n\\x0c71a\\nAPPENDIX F\\n\\xc2\\xa7 188.038, Revised Statutes of Missouri\\n188.038.\\nPregnant\\nwomen,\\nbias\\nor\\ndiscrimination against \\xe2\\x80\\x94 findings of general\\nassembly \\xe2\\x80\\x94 limitations on performing an\\nabortion, when. \\xe2\\x80\\x94 1. The general assembly of this\\nstate finds that:\\n(1) Removing vestiges of any past bias or\\ndiscrimination against pregnant women, their\\npartners, and their family members, including their\\nunborn children, is an important task for those in the\\nlegal, medical, social services, and human services\\nprofessions;\\n(2) Ending any current bias or discrimination\\nagainst pregnant women, their partners, and their\\nfamily members, including their unborn children, is a\\nlegitimate purpose of government in order to\\nguarantee that those who \\xe2\\x80\\x9care endowed by their\\nCreator with certain unalienable Rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can enjoy\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\n(3) The historical relationship of bias or\\ndiscrimination by some family planning programs and\\npolicies towards poor and minority populations,\\nincluding, but not limited to, the nonconsensual\\nsterilization of mentally ill, poor, minority, and\\nimmigrant women and other coercive family planning\\nprograms and policies, must be rejected;\\n(4) Among Missouri residents, the rate of black\\nor African-American women who undergo abortions is\\nsignificantly higher, about three and one-half* times\\nhigher, than the rate of white women who undergo\\nabortions. Among Missouri residents, the rate of\\nblack or African-American women who undergo\\n\\n\\x0c72a\\nrepeat abortions is significantly higher, about one and\\none-half* times higher, than the rate of white women\\nwho undergo repeat abortions;\\n(5) Performing or inducing an abortion because\\nof the sex of the unborn child is repugnant to the\\nvalues of equality of females and males and the same\\nopportunities for girls and boys, and furthers a false\\nmindset of female inferiority;\\n(6) Government has a legitimate interest in\\npreventing the abortion of unborn children with Down\\nSyndrome because it is a form of bias or disability\\ndiscrimination and victimizes the disabled unborn\\nchild at his or her most vulnerable stage. Eliminating\\nunborn children with Down Syndrome raises grave\\nconcerns for the lives of those who do live with\\ndisabilities. It sends a message of dwindling support\\nfor their unique challenges, fosters a false sense that\\ndisability is something that could have been\\navoidable, and is likely to increase the stigma\\nassociated with disability.\\n2.

Burger King Corp. v.\\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 472-473, 105 S. Ct. 2174,\\n2182, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528 (1985). To give fair warning of\\npossible suit there, for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca State to exercise jurisdiction\\nconsistent with due process, that relationship\\n[between the defendant and the forum] must arise out\\nof contacts that the defendant himself creates with\\nthe forum\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284, 113\\nS. Ct. 1115, 1122, 188 L. Ed. 2d 12 (2014) (emphasis\\nin the original).\\nThe question presented is:\\nIn a suit on a loan guaranty, can specific\\npersonal jurisdiction be involuntarily created over an\\nout-of-state guarantor based solely on a co-defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconsent, for itself, to a forum-selection consent clause\\nin its two-party borrower agreement with the lender,\\nwhen the guarantor did not negotiate or sign the codefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s borrower agreement nor sign or approve\\nthe defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged guaranty agreement, which\\nguaranty had no forum consent clause itself and did\\nnot reference the forum consent clause in the\\nborrower agreement?\\n\\n\\x0cii\\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING\\nMr. C. Al Buis, petitioner on review, was the\\npetitioner below and a defendant in the trial court.\\nThe Arlington County Circuit Court, 17th\\nJudicial Circuit of Virginia, and the Honorable\\nWilliam T. Newman, Jr., thereof, respondents on\\nreview, were the nominal respondents below.\\nDLI Assets Bravo LLC, a California limited\\nliability company, is plaintiff of record and the real\\nparty in interest per the Complaint filed in the trial\\ncourt.1\\nIn April 2021, the trial court granted Petitioner leave to file an\\nAmended Plea in Bar and Demurrer dated April 2, 2021, whose\\nnew first Plea therein is that the litigation below should be\\ndismissed as a legal nullity, ab initio, because the Plaintiff of\\nrecord below, DLI Assets Bravo, LLC, allegedly a California\\nlimited liability company (Complaint, \\xc2\\xb61) does not legally exist.\\nNo such domestic limited liability company of that name is\\nshown on the records of the California Secretary of State.\\nRather, that site shows only a foreign limited liability company\\nof the same name formed under Nevada law who is doing\\nbusiness in California. Therefore, Petitioner has argued below,\\neven if there was only a misnomer, not a misjoinder, the case\\nmust still be dismissed. See Estate of James v. Peyton, 277 Va.\\n442, 453, 674 S.E.2d 864, 868-69 (2009) (even where a plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nchange of name is a misnomer, not a misjoinder, a named\\nplaintiff who lacks standing cannot later be substituted by a new\\nplaintiff who does have standing; rather, the case is a legal\\nnullity so must be dismissed, ab initio). By a Memorandum\\nOpinion dated June 8, 2021, the trial court dismissed this first\\nPlea claiming lack of standing but, so far, an associated\\njudgment has not yet been entered.

Both are unreported.\\nOn July 14, 2020, the Arlington County Circuit\\nCourt, 17th Judicial Circuit Of Virginia entered a\\njudgment which denied Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s February 20,\\n2020, Motion To Quash Service And To Dismiss For\\nLack Of Personal Jurisdiction By Special Appearance\\n(the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMotion To Quash\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (App. at 5a-6a).

Both\\nrulings are unreported.\\nJURISDICTION\\nThe November 30, 2020, judgment of the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia, once Rehearing was\\ndenied on February 20, 2021, represents a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal\\norder\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the merits from Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest court\\nsufficient to create jurisdiction in this Court under 28\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257, unless this Court were to find that\\nclause \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Va. Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1, enacted effective\\nJuly 1, 2020 and on which there is no case law yet,\\ncompels a contrary ruling. This Petition is filed to\\nassure that jurisdiction in this Court exists under\\n28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257 if the Court determines that \\xc2\\xa78.01670.1(D) does not allow further state court appellate\\nreview of the underlying July 14, 2020, trial court\\njudgment complained of.\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nThis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Order of March 19, 2020, extended\\nthe date within which to file a Petition For A Writ Of\\nCertiorari therefrom to July 6, 2021, 150 days from\\nthe appellate court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last ruling.\\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY\\nPROVISIONS INVOLVED\\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\\nAmendment, U.S. Constitution, amend.

Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-328.1, the Commonwealth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlong-arm statute (App. at 9a-11a) provides, in\\nrelevant part,2 that:\\nA. A court may exercise personal\\njurisdiction over a person, who acts\\ndirectly or by an agent, as to a cause of\\naction arising from the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s:\\n1. Transacting any business in this\\nCommonwealth.\\n2.

Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1, titled Appeal of\\nInterlocutory orders and provisions by permission,\\nimmunity (App. at 12a-14a) says, in relevant part:\\nA. When, prior to the commencement of\\ntrial, the circuit court has entered in any\\npending civil action, except any matters\\nappealable to the Court of Appeals\\npursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 17.1-405, an order or\\ndecree that is not otherwise appealable,\\nany party may file in the circuit court a\\nmotion requesting that the circuit court\\ncertify such order or decree for\\ninterlocutory appeal.\\nThe motion shall include a concise\\nanalysis of the statutes, rules, or cases\\nbelieved to be determinative of the\\nissues and request that the court certify\\nin writing that the order or decree\\ninvolves a question of law as to which\\n(i) there is substantial ground for\\ndifference of opinion, (ii) there is no\\nclear, controlling precedent on point in\\nthe decisions of the Supreme Court of\\nVirginia or the Court of Appeals of\\nVirginia, (iii) determination of the issues\\nwill be dispositive of a material aspect of\\nthe proceeding currently pending before\\nthe court, and (iv) it is in the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best\\ninterest to seek an interlocutory appeal.\\nIf the request for certification is opposed\\nby any party, the parties may brief the\\nmotion in accordance with the Rules of\\nthe Supreme Court of Virginia.\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nWithin 15 days of the entry of an order\\nby the circuit court granting such\\ncertification, a petition for appeal may\\nbe filed with the appellate court that\\nwould have jurisdiction in an appeal\\nfrom a final judgment in the proceeding.\\nIf the appellate court determines that the\\ncertification by the circuit court has\\nsufficient merit, it may, in its discretion,\\npermit an appeal to be taken from the\\ninterlocutory order or decree and shall\\nnotify the certifying circuit court and\\ncounsel for the parties of its decision.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nD. The failure of a party to seek\\ninterlocutory appeal under this section\\nshall not preclude review of the issue on\\nappeal from a final order. An order by\\nthe appellate court denying review\\nunder this section shall not preclude\\nreview from a final order, unless the\\norder denying such interlocutory review\\nprovides for such preclusion.\\n(emph. added)\\nFinally, the text of 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257(a) (App. at\\n15a) says that:\\nFinal judgments or decrees rendered by\\nthe highest court of a State in which a\\ndecision could be had, may be reviewed\\nby the Supreme Court by writ of\\ncertiorari\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. where the validity of a\\ntreaty or statute of the United States is\\n\\n\\x0c6\\ndrawn in question or where the validity\\nof a statute of any State is drawn in\\nquestion on the ground of its being\\nrepugnant to the Constitution, treaties,\\nor laws of the United States, or where\\nany title, right, privilege, or immunity is\\nspecially set up or claimed under the\\nConstitution or the treaties or statutes\\nof, or any commission held or authority\\nexercised under, the United States.\\nINTRODUCTION\\nPetitioner, a Texas resident and an alleged\\nloan guarantor, has been unfairly subjected to\\nlitigation in Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courts in violation of his rights\\nto due process under the Fourteenth Amendment, and\\nVirginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-arm statute also. The statutory and\\nthe constitutional inquiries are one and the same and\\nmerge. See e.g. Peninsula Cruise, Inc. v. New River\\nYacht Sales, Inc., 257 Va. 315, 319, 512 S.E.2d 560,\\n562 (1999):\\n[t]he purpose of Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long arm\\nstatute is to assert jurisdiction over\\nnonresidents who engage in some\\npurposeful activity in this State to the\\nextent permissible under the due\\nprocess clause.\\nAccord Consulting Engineers Corp. v. Geometric,\\nLtd., 561 F.3d 273, 277 (4th Cir. 2014):\\nBecause Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s long-arm statute is\\nintended to extend personal jurisdiction\\nto the extent permissible under the due\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nprocess clause, the statutory inquiry\\nmerges with the constitutional inquiry.\\nIn Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S.\\n462, 471-72, 105 S. Ct. 2174, 2181-82, 85 L. Ed. 2d 528\\n(1985), this Court held that:\\nThe Due Process Clause protects an\\nindividual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s liberty interest in not being\\nsubject to the binding judgments of a\\nforum in which he has no meaningful\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontacts, ties or relations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBy\\nrequiring that individuals have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair\\nwarning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that a particular activity may\\nsubject [them] to the jurisdiction of a\\nforeign sovereign.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nThis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair warning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d requirement is\\nsatisfied\\nif\\nthe\\ndefendant\\nhas\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurposefully directed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d his activities at\\nresidents of the forum, and the litigation\\nresults from alleged injuries that \\xe2\\x80\\x9carise\\nout of or relate to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d those activities.\\n(internal citations omitted; punctuation\\nmodified; emph. added).\\nSee also Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 284, 134\\nS. Ct. 1115, 1121-1122, 186 L Ed. 2d 82 (2014):\\nFor a State to exercise jurisdiction\\nconsistent with due process, the\\ndefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suit-related conduct must\\ncreate a substantial connection with the\\nforum State. Two related aspects of this\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nnecessary relationship are relevant to\\n[the subject] case.\\nFirst, the relationship must arise out of\\ncontacts that the defendant himself\\ncreates with the forum State [emph. in\\nthe original, citing Burger King]. \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\nSecond, our \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminimum contacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nanalysis looks to the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncontacts with the forum State itself, not\\nthe defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contacts with persons\\nwho reside there.\\nThe sole basis given by the Circuit Court in\\ndenying the Motion to Quash rested in a consent to\\nVirginia jurisdiction given by Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s codefendant, Backwoods Retail, Inc. (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBackwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), for\\nitself, alone, in the forum selection clause of a twoparty \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d attached to the\\nComplaint as Ex. A (App. 27a-60a) whose stated\\nparties were Backwoods and the lender named\\ntherein, QuarterSpot. This Ex. A agreement, it held,\\ncould be read together, as one, with Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nalleged loan guaranty, titled a Borrower Validity\\nAgreement, part of Ex. D to the Complaint (App. at\\n65a), which had no forum consent clause itself nor\\ncross-referenced the forum clause in the Ex. A\\nagreement. The basis for the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, as had\\nbeen urged by the Plaintiff below, was Countryside\\nOrthopaedics, P.C. v. Peyton, 261 Va. 142, 541 S.E.2d\\n279 (2001).\\nThe Circuit Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s extension of the codefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own consent to Virginia jurisdiction over\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nPetitioner, affirmed on appeal, violated the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights to Constitutional due process as:\\nx\\n\\nunder Burger King and Walden,\\nconsent by an out-of-state defendant\\nto the jurisdiction of a foreign State\\ncan only arise from the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nown actions and conduct, alone, not\\nthe actions of a third-party codefendant.\\n\\nx\\n\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unrebutted evidence,\\nfrom both documents admitted into\\nevidence and his phone testimony,\\nnot crossed, was, among other things,\\nthat he did not sign, initial or even\\nknow of his alleged guaranty, part of\\nComplaint Ex. D, titled a Borrower\\nValidity Agreement (App. at 65a).\\nThe document which bore his typed\\nname followed by the initials CAB, he\\ntestified, was not in his handwriting\\nnor approved by him. Countryside\\nwas thus clearly inapplicable as\\nthere were not two signed contracts\\nfor the Circuit Court to even consider\\nreading together as one to start with.\\n\\nx\\n\\nA 2014 decision from the federal\\ndistrict court for the Western District\\nof Virginia, BioVeris Corp. v.\\nWohlstadter, 69 F. Supp. 3d 574\\n(W.D. Va. 2014), established that the\\nEx. A and D documents were clearly\\ntwo stand-alone agreements, not one.\\nYet, the trial court, and later the\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nSupreme Court of Virginia, refused\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s call to adopt and apply\\nBioVeris as Virginia law.\\nThe Court should grant this writ, rule that\\nspecific personal jurisdiction does not exist over\\nPetitioner and order him to be dismissed from the\\nVirginia state court litigation below, unless Va. Code\\n\\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1(D), a new statute discussed below, bars\\nrelief. It appears likely not to.\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\nA.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nThis Petition arises from collection litigation\\nagainst an out-of-state borrower and two alleged\\nindividual guarantors, one being the Petitioner, to\\ncollect a defaulted corporate loan debt. The Plaintiff\\nof record, DLI Assets Bravo, LLC, a California limited\\nliability company (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDLI\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) filed a Complaint on March\\n27, 2019, in the Arlington County Circuit Court\\nclaiming to be the present noteholder, as a second-tier\\nassignee of the original lender.\\nDLI named Petitioner C. Al Buis, a citizen of\\nTexas, as a defendant, claiming he guaranteed the\\nloan. As alleged in the Complaint, a Texas company,\\nco-defendant Backwoods Retail, Inc., borrowed money\\nfrom a Delaware lender, QuarterSpot, Inc. The\\nborrower and lender executed a Borrower Agreement,\\nand the borrower signed a promissory note (App. at\\n56a-60a). Complaint (App. at 16a, et. seq.), \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb61, 2, and\\n6 (App. at 17a and 18a).\\nDLI pleaded it was the holder of the note\\nbecause of two allonges \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the first, from QuarterSpot\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nto a DLI affiliate dated August 24, 2017, attached to\\nthe Complaint (App. at 61a), and a second Allonge the\\nsame day (not so attached) from that affiliated entity\\nto DLI itself. Id. at 3, \\xc2\\xb611 (App. at 19a). Plaintiff\\nalleged that the corporate borrower had defaulted on\\nthe note. Id., \\xc2\\xb613.\\nCount III of the Complaint is directed to Buis.\\nIt does not allege that he executed the Borrower\\nAgreement or the promissory note itself. It claims\\ninstead that he signed a two-paragraph document\\ncalled a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Validity Agreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ex. D to\\nthe Complaint, under which he indemnified\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cQuarterSpot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d against losses from any breach of two\\nspecific paragraphs of an unidentified document\\ntitled the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoan Agreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was not attached\\nto the Complaint.

A Borrower\\nAgreement. Complaint, Exhibit D (App. at 65a).\\nB.\\n\\nConstitutional objections\\n\\nBuis, by counsel, appeared specially to contest\\nin personal jurisdiction over him. His first objection\\nwas the Motion to Quash filed February 20, 2020.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\nPetitioner pled that his signature was not on the\\nguaranty, that he had insufficient contacts with\\nVirginia to create any jurisdiction over him, and that\\nthe Complaint nowhere asserted the basis on which\\njurisdiction was claimed, nor proved to the contrary.\\nHe also said (Motion to Quash at 4):\\nBuis has not yet pled on the merits and\\nherein seeks solely to have this case\\ndismissed and the related summons\\nquashed by special appearance of his\\nundersigned counsel solely to contest the\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal jurisdiction over him.\\nOn March 6, 2020, Plaintiff DLI filed its\\nOpposition to the Motion to Quash. DLI then asserted\\nthat Buis was bound by the forum selection clause\\nfound in \\xc2\\xb638 of the Borrower Agreement, a document\\nbetween his-co-defendant and the lender, alone.\\nIn response, Buis filed a Memorandum of Law\\nof March 26, 2020. One of its exhibits was his original\\nFebruary 29, 2020, Affidavit (App. at 66a-68a) which\\nsaid, among other jurisdictional facts, that the initials\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCAB\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the Ex. D Borrower Agreement (on which\\nhis name was typed in the signature block) were not\\nin Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s handwriting, that he had no\\nrecollection of the Ex. D guaranty and had not\\nnegotiated any financing for Backwoods with the\\nPlaintiff.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brief cited Alper v. Cordova, 64 Va.\\nCir. 87, 2007 WL 515230 (Fairfax County Cir. Ct. Feb.\\n24, 2004), which held that a defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s typed name\\nfound on a document in the Commonwealth did not\\ncreate specific personal jurisdiction if that was the\\ndefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only contact with the forum. Petitioner\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nalso cited and applied the various BioVeris tests to\\nshow that, properly considered, the Ex. A Borrower\\nAgreement and the Ex. D Borrower Validity\\nAgreement were two separate documents, not one, as\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument for jurisdiction urged. Meaning,\\nPetitioner argued in his legal memorandum, that\\neven if the Ex. D guaranty were treated as signed,\\nwhen it should not be so treated, it still could not be\\nconstrued as one, together with the Ex. A Borrower\\nAgreement, to bind Petitioner to Virginia jurisdiction,\\nsolely by his co-defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consent to that effect in\\nthe Ex. A document for itself, alone, as Plaintiff\\nmaintained.\\nPetitioner urged that BioVeris be\\nadopted as Virginia law.\\nC.\\n\\nEvidentiary Hearing on Motion to Quash\\n\\nOn June 26, 2020, as expressly requested by\\nBuis in his February 20, 2020, Motion To Quash, an\\nevidentiary hearing was held thereon. After taking\\nevidence from Petitioner Buis, in the form of\\ndocuments and phone testimony (a personal\\nappearance not being possible in those early days of\\nCOVID), and after hearing argument from counsel,\\nthe Circuit Court nevertheless denied Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nMotion to Quash. The sole basis given by the Court\\nfor its ruling was that the Ex. A and the Ex. D\\nagreements could be read together as one, as the\\nPlaintiff had urged. Thereby extending Backwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nconsent to Virginia jurisdiction for itself, in the Ex.\\nA Borrower Agreement, involuntarily over the\\nPetitioner.\\nEven though, the evidence showed,\\nPetitioner had neither negotiated nor signed the Ex.\\nA document, nor signed or approved the Ex. D\\nguaranty either, which had no forum selection clause\\nitself nor referenced the co-defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forum consent\\n\\n\\x0c14\\nin the Ex. A Borrower Agreement. The Circuit Court\\nentered its associated judgment on July 14, 2020.3\\nElaborating, Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence at the June\\n26, 2020, evidentiary hearing on his Motion To\\nQuash, by both (i) his Feb. 29, 2020, Affidavit [App. at\\n66a-68a] and other documents now moved and\\nadmitted into evidence, and his (ii) phone testimony\\nalso, was that:\\nx\\n\\nhe did not know the original lender,\\nQuarterSpot, and had never spoken\\nwith nor contacted it to request\\nfinancing for Backwoods. And, that\\nhe had he never negotiated financing\\non behalf of Backwoods with it.\\n\\nTo avoid default, Buis filed his initial responsive pleading to\\nthe Complaint in the Circuit Court on August 4, 2020. This took\\nthe form of a Plea in Bar and Demurrer which now included\\nStatute of Frauds and various other merits defenses not pled\\nearlier in the Motion to Quash. It also included a plea, again,\\nthat the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over Petitioner,\\nnotwithstanding the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s July 14, 2020, ruling to the\\ncontrary, to preserve the issue for appeal. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s filing of\\nthe Plea in Bar and Demurrer did not waive his earlier\\njurisdictional objection. Va. Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-277.1; Preston v. Legard,\\n160 Va. 364, 372 (1933). Months later, an Amended Plea in Bar\\nand Demurrer, dated April 2, 2021, was filed with leave of the\\nCircuit Court. It now added, as a new first Plea, that the Plaintiff\\nof record was a non-existent legal entity which had no authority\\nor standing to file the Complaint below. Requiring, Petitioner\\nurged, that the case below be dismissed as a legal nullity, ab\\ninitio, under Estate of James v. Peyton, 277 Va. 443, 453, 674\\nS.E.2d 864, 866-69 (Va. 2009). This Amended Plea In Bar and\\nDemurrer still included, as one of the pleas, a plea that the trial\\ncourt lacked personal jurisdiction over Defendant, to avoid\\nclaims of waiver.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nx\\n\\nthe initials CAB on the Borrower\\nValidity Agreement attached to the\\nComplaint as part of Ex. D [App. at\\n65a] were NOT in his handwriting\\nnor authorized by him. He had never\\nsigned or initialed his alleged Ex. D\\nguaranty or agreed to let anyone do\\nso for him, nor agreed to any use of\\nelectronic signatures.\\n\\nx\\n\\nhe owned no stock in Backwoods\\ndirectly and had only an 8% indirect\\ninterest therein.\\n\\nx\\n\\nBackwoods, bankrupt several years\\nago, had operated no stores in\\nVirginia and was not registered to do\\nbusiness in the Commonwealth, and\\n\\nx\\n\\nhe had, personally, no Virginia assets\\nor connections (thus, with his other\\nevidence, no contacts sufficient to\\ncreate support general or specific\\njurisdiction over him there).\\n\\nDLI did not cross examine Petitioner on June\\n26, 2020, nor present any evidence of its own that day.\\nRather, DLI merely argued that Countryside should\\nbe extended to create involuntary personal\\njurisdiction over Buis based not on his own conduct,\\nalone, but solely on a consent to Virginia jurisdiction\\nmade by co-defendant Backwoods for itself, alone, via\\nthe forum selection clause of the Ex, A Borrower\\nAgreement.\\nThe Ex. A Borrower Agreement, whose only\\nexhibit was a promissory note from co-defendant\\n\\n\\x0c16\\nBackwoods to QuarterSpot, did not reference therein\\nany personal guarantees of that loan, by Petitioner or\\nanyone else. It also did not have any reference to\\nPetitioner by name. The Ex. A \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwas not signed in Backwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x99 corporate name but,\\nrather, allegedly, by co-defendant, Ms. Jennifer\\nNeuhaus, whose revocable trust was the 60% majority\\nshareholder of Backwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x99 parent company. The Ex.\\nA document had as its sole exhibit Backwoods alleged\\npromissory note to QuarterSpot.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nalleged\\nBorrower\\nValidity\\nAgreement, part of Ex. D to the Complaint.4 stated\\nthat its purpose was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo induce QuarterSpot to enter\\ninto a Borrower Agreement with the Borrower.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHowever, the Ex. D guaranty document for Buis\\n(App.65a) did not identify who the parties to the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d referenced therein were, the\\ndate of that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Agreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nor what the\\nterms of any loan under the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nreferenced in the Ex. D document even were. Details\\nof the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoan Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d referenced in the Ex. D\\nguaranty were similarly lacking.\\nDLI\\nnevertheless argued that\\nunder\\nCountryside, which it cited by name for the first time\\nonly at the hearing, the Ex. A Borrower Agreement\\nhad to be read and construed as one document,\\ntogether, with Buis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 alleged Ex. D Borrower Validity\\nAgreement. So, DLI asserted, that in this backdoor\\nand improper fashion Backwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x99 own consent to\\nVirginia jurisdiction in \\xc2\\xb638 of the Ex. A Borrower\\nEx. D to the Complaint also includes a second guaranty, a\\nsimilar two-paragraph document also titled a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorrower Validity\\nAgreement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this time bearing the typed name of co-defendant\\nJennifer Neuhaus, followed by illegible initials. App. at 64a\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0c17\\nAgreement, for itself, alone, could be involuntarily\\nextended over Petitioner Buis as well. Even though,\\nthe evidence showed, Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own alleged Ex. D\\nguaranty had not been signed and had no forum\\nconsent clause itself. And, Buis testified, that he had\\nnot negotiated the Ex. A agreement, which says it is\\nbetween Backwoods and QuarterSpot, whose forum\\nconsent clause was not cross-referenced in the Ex. D\\nguaranty document.\\nD.\\n\\nTrial Court Judgment, denying the Motion to\\nQuash.\\n\\nOn that record, the trial court, in its bench\\nruling of June 26, 2020, still accepted Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal\\nargument on personal jurisdiction. The transcript\\nshows the following dialogue at the very end of the\\nevidentiary hearing that day (Tr. at 27:12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 28:12,\\nwhich transcript was filed with the Supreme Court of\\nVirginia below as part of a Document Appendix which\\naccompanied the Petition For Appeal):\\nMr. Tatge [Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Counsel]: And\\nwe submit, Your Honor, for all the\\nreasons that we argued that the Court\\ndoes lack specific \\xe2\\x80\\x93 either general or\\nspecific jurisdiction over my client, and,\\nYour Honor, that we would ask that in\\nview thereof that the Court go ahead and\\njust grant Mr. Buis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Motion to Dismiss\\nand the plaintiff can have a second shot\\nif it wants down in Texas.\\nThe Court: All right. The Court in this\\ncase is going to deny the motion.\\n\\n\\x0c18\\nMs. Powell [Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel]: Thank\\nYou, Your Honor.\\nThe Court: All right. Please prepare an\\norder to that effect.\\nMr. Tatge: Your Honor, were there \\xe2\\x80\\x93 can\\nI ask were there reasons why the Court\\ndenied the motion?\\nThe Court: I believe that in this case\\nthese two documents can be read\\ntogether.\\nMr. Tatge: All right. Thank you, Your\\nHonor.\\nThe Court: Yes sir.\\nMs. Powell: Thank you, Your Honor.\\n(Whereupon, at 12:10 p.m., the taking of\\nthe instant hearing ceased.)\\nOn July 14, 2020, the trial court entered its\\nassociated judgment denying Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion to\\nQuash.\\nE.\\n\\nCertification of Interlocutory Appeal\\n\\nTo its great credit, the Circuit Court, on\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion of July 30, 2020, took the unusual\\nstep of certifying an interlocutory appeal to the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia from its July 14, 2020,\\njudgment that denied the Motion to Quash. The\\nCertification of Interlocutory Appeal dated August 14,\\n2020, [App. at 2a-4a] acknowledged, among other\\nthings, that:\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nx\\n\\nthere were substantial grounds for\\ndifferences of opinion on whether\\npersonal jurisdiction existed or not\\nover the Petitioner.\\n\\nx\\n\\nno controlling precedent on point\\nexisted in the decisions of the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia or the\\nCourt of Appeals of Virginia and\\n\\nx\\n\\nthat a different ruling on appeal,\\nwere the Petition For Appeal granted\\nby the Supreme Court of Virginia and\\nthereafter, following briefing and\\nargument, if the trial court were then\\nreversed, would be dispositive of a\\nmaterial portion of the litigation\\npending in the trial court. Here,\\nPetitioner\\nwould\\nhave\\nbeen\\ndismissed from litigating further in\\nVirginia.5\\n\\nPetitioner was and is very grateful for that\\nopportunity from the trial court to appeal.\\nF.\\n\\nSupreme Court of Virginia Appeal\\n\\nPetitioner argued to the Supreme Court of\\nVirginia, in his Petition For Appeal, that the Plaintiff\\nhad the burden of proof below to show that\\nCounsel to co-defendant Jennifer Neuhaus did not enter his\\nappearance in the Circuit Court case below until September 2,\\n2020, several days after Mr. Buis had filed his Petition For\\nAppeal with the Supreme Court of Virginia, on August 28, 2020.\\nCo-defendant Backwoods, which the record below shows filed\\nChapter 11 bankruptcy in Texas several years ago, has never\\nappeared in the Circuit Court action.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c20\\njurisdiction existed over him, under Iron City Sav.\\nBank v. Isaacsen, 158 Va. 609, 630-31 (1932). Which\\nburden it did not meet below. While not cited there,\\nEastern Technological Enterprises, Inc. v. Wilson &\\nHayes, Inc., 46 Va. Cir. 558 (Circuit Court for the City\\nof Norfolk, July 10, 1997) likewise holds the burden of\\nproof to prove that jurisdiction exists over the\\ndefendant is on the plaintiff under Virginia law. Slip\\nop. at *2, citing federal case law from this Court.\\nThe Petition For Appeal urged that the\\nComplaint did not describe, and the evidence below\\ndid not show, any conduct by Petitioner in or directed\\nat Virginia, let alone any evidence of a substantial\\nconnection between any such conduct and Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlitigation claims below. So, Petitioner urged, the trial\\ncourt had erred in finding specific personal\\njurisdiction over him.6\\nPetitioner advised the Virginia Supreme Court\\nthat his documentary and testimonial evidence below,\\nagainst personal jurisdiction, had not been challenged\\nby the Plaintiff. Buis also argued on appeal the\\nPlaintiff had put on no evidence of its own below,\\nrelying only on its claim that backdoor jurisdiction\\nexisted over Buis via Countryside.\\nFurthermore, Petitioner argued, the trial court\\nhad misapplied Countryside, and that Walden and\\nBurger King both barred his being bound to Virginia\\nPetitioner being a long-standing resident of Texas with no\\nVirginia business or assets, as his Affidavit admitted into\\nevidence at trial (App. at 66a-68a) also showed, Plaintiff never\\nargued that Petitioner had the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontinuous and systematic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ncontacts needed to support general jurisdiction over him in\\nVirginia.\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c21\\njurisdiction only by the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own consent to a\\nforum selection clause in the Ex. A Borrower\\nAgreement, alone.\\nMoreover, that was not an\\nagreement he had not negotiated, signed, or seen,\\nwhich he was not party to. And that he had also\\nproved below he had not signed his putative Ex. D\\nguaranty, which itself had no forum selection clause\\ntherein. Additionally, the Ex. D guaranty did not\\ncross reference the forum selection clause in the Ex.\\nA Borrower Agreement either. He could permissibly\\nbe bound to Virginia jurisdiction only by his own\\nconduct, not solely by the actions of his co-defendant,\\nBackwoods, Petitioner maintained.\\nPetitioner again urged, on appeal, that\\nBioVeris be adopted as state law and illustrated, as\\nhe had below, how its tests should be applied in the\\npresent circumstances. Referencing, among other\\nthings, a merger clause in the two-party Ex. A\\nBorrower Agreement which said it was the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete\\nagreement\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the two parties thereto, alone, as well\\nas language in the Ex. A agreement referring to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ceither party\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany party,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d showing, again, a\\nmulti-party agreement with Petitioner was not\\nintended. Petitioner claimed also that because the\\nEx. D guaranty referenced a few paragraphs, in\\ntwo other documents, this showed it was not intended\\nto be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guaranty which picked up all\\nobligations under the Ex. A agreement, etc. Again\\nshowing, applying BioVeris, that the Ex. A and Ex. D\\nagreements are, properly considered, two separate\\nagreements at law, not to be read together as one, as\\nthe trial court did.\\nTellingly, Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Brief in Opposition filed\\nwith the Supreme Court of Virginia on September 18,\\n\\n\\x0c22\\n2020, in response to the Petition For Appeal, never\\ncited Walden or Burger King. Let alone distinguished\\nor applied them to the present circumstances.\\nOn October 20, 2020, the writ panel heard 10\\nminutes of oral argument from Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel,\\nalone, as the applicable Virginia appellate rules\\nprovide, about why the Petition For Appeal should be\\ngranted. While questions were invited by Petitioner\\nfrom the three Justice writ panel none were posed.\\nAfter the November 30, 2020, judgment that\\ndeclined the Petition For Appeal was entered,\\nPetitioner filed, on December 14, 2020, his Petition\\nFor Rehearing thereof. The Petition For Rehearing\\nwas itself denied on February 5, 2021.\\nThis Petition For A Writ of Certiorari follows.\\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT\\nI.\\n\\nThis Court clearly has jurisdiction, unless\\nit determines that the November 30, 2020,\\njudgment, which employed language historically\\nconstrued as being an adverse summary\\nadjudication on the merits, is no longer such\\ndue to section \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Va. Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1,\\nenacted July 1, 2020. That is not clearly\\nthe case, so this Petition is filed.\\nA.\\n\\nThis Court has jurisdiction over final\\njudgments of a state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest court\\non discrete federal questions, even if\\nactions are continuing against the\\nPetitioner and others on state law claims.\\n\\nEven though litigation is now continuing below\\non the various state law claims brought by the\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nPlaintiff against the Petitioner and his co-defendants,\\nthis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257 to\\nhear this appeal from a final judgment on a federal\\nquestion from the Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s highest court, if there is\\na final judgment here. As seems likely. See e.g., Cox\\nBroadcasting Corp. v. Cohn, 420 U.S. 469, 477, 95\\nS. Ct. 1029, 1037, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328 (1975):\\n[a]s the cases have unfolded, the Court\\nhas recurringly encountered situations\\nin which the highest court of a State has\\nfinally determined the federal issues\\npresent in a particular case, but in which\\nthere are further proceedings in the\\nlower state courts to come. There are\\nnow at least four categories of such cases\\nin which the Court has treated the\\ndecision on the federal issue as a final\\njudgment for purposes of 28 U.S.C. 1257\\nand has taken jurisdiction without\\nawaiting the completion of the\\nadditional proceedings anticipated in\\nthe lower state courts. In most, if not all,\\nof the cases in these categories, these\\nadditional proceedings would not\\nrequire the decision of other federal\\nquestions that might also require review\\nby the Court at a later date, and\\nimmediate rather than delayed review\\nwould be the best way to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nmischief of economic waste and delayed\\ninjustice,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Radio State WOW, Inc. v.\\nJohnson [328 U.S. 120, 65 S.

Ed. 2d 562 (1945)], supra at 1478, as\\nwell as precipitate interference with\\nstate litigation.,,,\\n\\n\\x0c24\\nIn the first category are those cases in\\nwhich there are further proceedings \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\neven entire trials \\xe2\\x80\\x93 yet to occur in the\\nstate courts but where for one reason or\\nanother the federal issue is conclusive\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\nSecond, there are cases\\xe2\\x80\\xa6in which the\\nfederal issue, finally decided by the\\nhighest court in the State, will survive\\nand require decision regardless of the\\noutcome of the future state-court\\nproceedings\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\nIn the third category are those situations\\nwhere the federal claim has been\\ndecided, with further proceedings on the\\nmerits in the state courts to come, but in\\nwhich later review of the federal issue\\ncannot be had, whatever the ultimate\\noutcome of the case. Thus, in these\\ncases, if the party seeking interim\\nreview ultimately prevails on the merits,\\nthe federal issue will be mooted; if he\\nwere to lose on the merits, however, the\\ngoverning state law would not permit\\nhim again to present the federal claims\\nfor review\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.\\nLastly, there are those situations where\\nthe federal issue has been finally decided\\nin the state courts with further\\nproceedings pending in which the party\\nseeking review here might prevail on the\\nmerits on nonfederal grounds, thus\\nrendering unnecessary review of the\\nfederal issue by this Court, and where\\n\\n\\x0c25\\nreversal of the state court on the federal\\nissue would be preclusive of any further\\nlitigation on the relevant cause of action\\nrather than merely controlling the\\nnature and character of, or determining\\nthe admissibility of evidence in, the state\\nproceedings still to come. In these\\ncircumstances, if a refusal immediately\\nto review the state court decision might\\nseriously erode federal policy, the Court\\nhas entertained and decided the federal\\nissue, which itself has been finally\\ndetermined by state courts for purposes\\nof the state litigation.\\nPetitioner respectfully submits that, unless\\nnew subparagraph \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of Va. Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1\\ncompels a different result, and it is not clear it does\\n(see below), this Court can hear and should grant this\\npetition, however the present situation is viewed.\\nPetitioner also cannot sue in federal court;\\nrather, any appeal from the judgment of the Supreme\\nCourt of Virginia must be to this Court.

Rather, as\\n\\n\\x0c27\\nhere, litigants can presently only file a Petition For\\nAppeal to the Supreme Court of Virginia.7\\nA commission to study the massive docket load\\nfaced by an understandably overburdened Supreme\\nCourt of Virginia, and the fact appeals there are not\\nof right, was established in 2020.8 In March 2021,\\nlegislation was enacted expanding the number of\\njudges of the Court of Appeals of Virginia and\\nproviding now for appeals of right, not merely be\\npermission of the Supreme Court of Virginia as under\\npresent law, from trial court civil judgments such as\\nthe July 14, 2020, judgment implicated here.

See\\nhttps://virginia-appeals.com/a-quick-read-on-appellate-statistics/\\n#.YNTDqxGSmUk. This Court grants far less writs itself, say,\\n1-2% due to, again, understandable workload issues. Id.\\n7\\n\\nJudicial Council of Virginia to Study Expansion of the Court of\\nAppeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Jurisdiction, Organized (www.normanthomaslaw.com)\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c28\\nD. The failure of a party to seek\\ninterlocutory appeal under this section\\nshall not preclude review of the issue on\\nappeal from a final order. An order by\\nthe appellate court denying review\\nunder this section shall not preclude\\nreview from a final order, unless the\\norder denying such interlocutory review\\nprovides for such preclusion.\\n(emph. added)\\nIt can be argued that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplain meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the\\nstatute now means that the November 30, 2020,\\njudgment of the Virginia Supreme Court is no longer\\na \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal judgment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as it clearly would be under\\nVirginia law before this statute was enacted, as there\\nis no language therein which expressly bars later\\nappeal, such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cand no further appeal can be taken\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nIn which case this Court would lack jurisdiction to\\nconsider a timely petition for a writ of certiorari under\\n28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257. If this Court so rules, this Petition\\nshould be dismissed. Whereupon Petitioner will try\\nagain to later raise his Constitution concerns before\\nthe Court of Appeals of Virginia in 2022, once its civil\\njurisdiction then expands, or possibly later. If need\\nbe.\\nOn the other hand, it can also be argued that\\nbecause the exact language of the Supreme Court of\\nVirginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s November 30, 2020, judgment has already\\nbeen adjudged by Virginia courts to be a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nsummary (adverse) adjudication of the subject appeal\\non its merits, this necessarily means, even without\\nmore, that the ruling already contains all the\\nlanguage required to preclude further state court\\nappellate review and that the November 30, 2020\\n\\n\\x0c29\\njudgment in question is now final, on the merits,\\neven after enactment of \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1(D). Unless, for\\nexample, additional language had been added by the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia to the language it used\\nhere, in the November 30, 2020 judgment, to say,\\nexpressly, as part of the written judgment denying a\\nparticular Petition For Appeal, that the Supreme\\nCourt of Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denial of the interlocutory appeal\\nin question does not bar later appellate review of the\\nissue(s) presented in the subject appeal, after a final\\norder has been entered in the trial court adjudicating\\nall issues in the underlying case. There is no such\\nlanguage in the November 30, 2020 judgment\\nexpressly allowed later appeals after a final order is\\nentered here.\\nMoreover, the legislative history of \\xc2\\xa78.01670.1(D), provided to Petitioner on June 28, 2021, by\\nthe Legislative Service of Virginia, a state agency,\\nsuggests clause \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was enacted to address\\ninterlocutory appeals where the sovereign immunity\\nof the Commonwealth of Virginia, and that of other\\nstate actors, employees and agencies, was at issue in\\nthe trial court, and the impact of the Supreme Court\\nof Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denial of an interlocutory appeal in that\\ncontext. Rather than aimed at the situation presented\\nhere.\\nThe Executive Summary of an August 30, 2019,\\nMemorandum to John Keith, Chairman of the BoydGraves Conference, from the Committee on\\nInterlocutory Appeals, states, in relevant part:\\n[S]econd, Code \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1 should be\\namended to provide a more expeditious\\nappeal of an interlocutory order granting\\n\\n\\x0c30\\nor denying a plea of immunity\\xe2\\x80\\xa6The\\nmechanism allows a faster decision by\\nthe appellate court on the immunity\\nquestion which, in turn, will expedite\\nproceedings in the trial court. Unlike\\nthe federal rule, under which the party\\nasserting immunity may pursue an\\ninterlocutory appeal, the amendment\\nrecommended here would allow either\\nparty to seek appellate review of the trial\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s immunity ruling.\\nUnder the amendments proposed here,\\nappellate review of the interlocutory\\nappeal will not stay proceedings in the\\ntrial court unless the trial court or the\\nappellate court otherwise provides. And\\na decision by the appellate court denying\\nthe interlocutory appeal will not preclude\\nreview of the question on appeal from the\\nfinal order, unless the appellate court\\notherwise provides.\\nBacon-Graves Conf. Mem. at 1 (emph.\\nadded).9\\n\\nPresumably referring to the ultimate judgment by the trial\\ncourt in the case, after all issues and points of law therein have\\nbeen adjudicated. Yet, Virginia law shows that trial court\\njudgments before then can still sometimes be viewed as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSee e.g., Samuel v. Samuel, Record Nos. 2501-01-2, 1417-02,\\n2004 WL 135895 (Va. Ct.

Or something else? The\\nlegislative history of the statute suggests the latter.\\nSee the Boyd-Graves Conf. Mem. at 4:\\nIn 2011, Senator Stanley introduced a\\nbill \\xe2\\x80\\x93 S.B. 1381, https://tinyurl.com/\\ny6zv5qd2- to allow an interlocutory\\nappeal of \\xe2\\x80\\x9can order denying a plea of\\nsovereign immunity made by the\\nCommonwealth\\nor\\nany\\nagency,\\ninstrumentality, political subdivision, or\\nagent or employee thereof.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The bill failed\\nin the Courts of Justice Committee. Our\\ncommittee reached out to Senator\\nStanley, who did not recall significant\\nopposition to the bill. He indicated that\\nlegislators may have been concerned the\\nappeal of the immunity issue might delay\\nproceedings in the trial court. He offered\\nthat that would not be a problem with\\nour proposal, however, which provides\\nthat an interlocutory appeal does not\\nautomatically stay trial court proceedings.\\n(emph. added).\\n\\n\\x0c32\\nII.\\n\\nThe November 30, 2020, judgment of the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia represents an\\nunwarranted and dangerous expansion of\\nspecific personal jurisdiction and conflicts with\\nseveral reported decisions of this Court.\\nS. Ct. Rule 10 supports accepting this Petition\\nFor A Writ of Certiorari.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court of Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment of\\nNovember 30, 2020, which left the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\njudgment of July 14, 2020, denying the Motion to\\nQuash in place, represents, like the opinion below, an\\nunwarranted, overly expansive view of specific\\npersonal jurisdiction, beyond the permissible use and\\nboundaries of Walden, Burger King, and more\\nrecently Ford Motor Company. There, __ U.S. ___,\\n141 S. Ct. 1017, 1024-25, 209 L. Ed. 2d 225 (2021),\\nthis Court held that to find specific personal\\njurisdiction:\\nThe defendant, we have said, must take\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csome act by which [it] purposefully\\navails itself of the privilege of conducting\\nactivities within the forum State. The\\ncontacts must be the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own\\nchoice and not \\xe2\\x80\\x9crandom, isolated, or\\nfortuitous.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d They must show that the\\ndefendant deliberately \\xe2\\x80\\x9creached out\\nbeyond\\xe2\\x80\\x9d its home\\xe2\\x80\\x94by, for example,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cexploi[ting] a market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the forum\\nState or entering a contractual\\nrelationship centered there. Yet even\\nthen\\xe2\\x80\\x94because the defendant is not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cat\\nhome\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94the forum State may exercise\\njurisdiction in only certain cases. The\\nplaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims, we have oft stated,\\n\\n\\x0c33\\nmust arise out of or relate to the\\ndefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the forum. Or\\nput just a bit differently, there must be\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98an affiliation between the forum and the\\nunderlying controversy, principally, [an]\\nactivity or an occurrence that takes\\nplace in the forum State and is therefore\\nsubject to the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n(Internal punctuation modified; citations\\nomitted; emph. added in italics).\\nThe uncontested evidence below at trial on\\nJune 26, 2020, showed, without question of any\\ndispute over \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjurisdictional facts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Plaintiff having\\nraised no objections to Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence) that\\nPetitioner had not signed, initialed or approved the\\nEx. D guaranty bearing only his typed name. And that\\nhe had also not negotiated Backwoods\\xe2\\x80\\x99 alleged loan\\nfrom QuarterSpot and knew nothing of it, nor of the\\nEx. A Borrower Agreement. It also showed that\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged Ex. D guaranty lacked a forum\\nclause itself and did not cross reference the forum\\nselection clause in the Ex. A Borrower Agreement.\\nAnd the Plaintiff put on no evidence to show that the\\nEx. D guaranty even clearly referenced the Ex. A\\nagreement at all.\\nReading the Ex. A and the Ex. D documents as\\none, given this evidence, at the misguided urging of\\nPlaintiff DLI, the trial court, and then on appeal the\\nSupreme Court of Virginia, did just what Walden,\\nBurger King, Ford Motor Company and other\\ndecisions of this Court all say cannot be done --- treat\\nthe Petitioner, an out-of-state defendant, as bound to\\nthe jurisdiction of Virginia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s courts, a forum with\\n\\n\\x0c34\\nwhich he has no legally cognizable contacts himself\\nwhich could create jurisdiction, as nevertheless\\nsubject to jurisdiction there. Not by virtue of his own\\nconduct, alone, but, improperly, based solely on the\\nacts of his co-defendant, Backwoods.\\nThere was no proof that Petitioner signed\\na guaranty agreement in Virginia. Nor that he\\nnegotiated third-party loan contracts in Virginia, the\\nperformance of which Petitioner personally later\\nguaranteed outside the forum, in Texas. There was\\nno evidence below that Buis himself had signed,\\ninitialed or even knew of the Ex. D guaranty\\ndocument bearing his typed name. Here, his putative\\nEx. D guaranty bore only his typed name and, was not\\ninitialed or approved by the Petitioner. Which Ex. D\\nguaranty had no forum selection clause itself nor\\ncross referenced the Virginia forum selection consent\\nclause in the Ex. A Borrower Agreement either. The\\nevidence was the Ex. A document concerned a loan\\nwhich Petitioner had not negotiated. Nor did Plaintiff\\npresent any proof that Petitioner sent numerous\\nemails or made many phone calls to Virginia on the\\nsubject loan, or regarding any guaranty thereof. Or,\\nthat he had sent signed guaranty documents into\\nthe Commonwealth related to his corporate codefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan.\\nThe trial court, nevertheless, extended\\nCountryside and found personal jurisdiction over the\\nPetitioner out of, in essence, thin air. And it was\\nsummarily affirmed on appeal. Based on nothing\\nPetitioner did, but solely from his co-defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nactions. This violates Walden, Burger King, and Ford\\nMotor Company.\\n\\n\\x0c35\\nDLI did not meet its burden of proof to show\\npersonal jurisdiction over the Petitioner in Virginia,\\nnor even come close.\\nUnder S. Ct. Rule 10 this Petition should be\\ngranted.\\nIII.\\n\\nThe November 30, 2020, judgment of the\\nVirginia Supreme Court, left in place on\\nFebruary 5, 2021, was wrong. Law from other\\nstates shows that.\\n\\nA recent Georgia federal district court decision,\\nIOU Central, Inc. v. Big State Tire and Axle, Inc., No.\\n1:20-CV-200-MHC, 2020 WL 6588742 (N.D. Ga. Oct.\\n8, 2020), held the court there had no specific or\\ngeneral personal jurisdiction over defendant Melissa\\nKay Ebarb, a Kansas citizen (M. Ebarb). She had not\\nsigned a loan guaranty, unlike her husband, who had.\\nMs. Ebarb was sued in Georgia along with her spouse,\\ndefendant Roy Lee Ebarb, also a Kansas citizen (R.\\nEbarb). He had, on behalf of defendant Big State Tire\\nAnd Axle, Inc., a Kansas company (BTSA), submitted\\na loan application to the plaintiff, IOU Central, Inc.,\\nin Georgia, and had guaranteed that loan. See slip\\nop. at *4:\\nIOU asserts that because M. Ebarb is a\\nco-debtor to the loan and that R&S and\\nRSS are alter-egos of R. Ebarb, they are\\nall jointly and severally liable\\xe2\\x80\\xa6IOU\\ndoes not present any evidence to indicate\\nthat M. Ebarb, R&S and RSS are parties\\nto the Note and Guaranty. In support\\nof their motion [to dismiss for lack\\nof jurisdiction] R. Ebarb and BSTA\\npresented the affidavit of R. Ebarb,\\n\\n\\x0c36\\nwhich contained Exhibit A \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Note and\\nGuaranty\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.Neither document contains\\nthe name or signature of M. Ebarb, RSS\\nor R&S. IOU has not alleged any facts\\nthat support a finding that M. Ebarb,\\nR&S or RSS transacted business in\\nGeorgia. Accordingly, the Court finds\\nthat IOU has failed to establish that M.\\nEbarb, R&S or RSS transacted business\\nwithin the meaning of the first prong of\\nthe Georgia long-arm statute.\\n(emph. added).\\nHere, there was, similarly, no evidence that\\nPetitioner ever signed his putative Ex. D guaranty,\\nwhich had no forum consent clause itself. Nor did\\nPlaintiff present evidence that Petitioner had\\notherwise done business in or directed any conduct at\\nVirginia, let alone related to DLI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s litigation claims,\\nas alleged assignee of the QuarterSpot note.\\nThis Court should grant the writ and remedy\\nthis unfortunate situation.\\nIV.\\n\\nThis case presents an excellent opportunity\\nfor this Court to clarify, nationally, the\\npermissible scope of specific personal\\njurisdiction, in the context of an alleged\\nguarantor, and advance Virginia law.\\n\\nThe Court can make meaningful contributions\\nto the American public, across all 50 states, by\\nratifying and clarifying that specific personal\\njurisdiction does not exist over a defendant in the\\nfactual circumstances of the Petitioner. This Court\\nhas also not often addressed how, when and why\\n\\n\\x0c37\\nspecific personal jurisdiction exist over a putative\\nguarantor. This is a good opportunity to give\\nguidance there too.\\nThis action would help not only guarantors, but\\nother defendants also, down the road, nationwide,\\nand avoid them bearing the huge expenses of time,\\nmoney and worry that the Plaintiff has foisted on the\\nPetitioner here. By forcing him to unreasonably\\nlitigate in a jurisdiction, Virginia, with which he has\\nno legally cognizable connections or activities\\nsufficient to create specific personal (or general)\\njurisdiction over him there.\\nFinally, by ruling on whether and how Va.\\nCode \\xc2\\xa78.01-670.1(D) applies in the present situation\\nthe Court can make an important contribution to the\\ndevelopment of Virginia law.\\nCONCLUSION\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari should\\nbe GRANTED.\\nJuly 1, 2021\\n\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nC.

At the same time, the federal government\\'s Health and Human Services Pain\\nManagement Best Practices Inter-Agency Task Force has determined that tens of millions of\\nAmericans rely on legal prescription opioids to treat acute or severe chronic pain, including pain\\narising from cancer as well as terminal or degenerative illnesses. The Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) long ago approved opioid medications for these purposes, and doctors\\nthroughout the country lawfully prescribe them. Congress tasked DOJ and its sub-agency DEA\\nwith primary responsibility for preventing drug abuse. With respect to illegal opioids\\xe2\\x80\\x94the chief\\ncause of opioid overdose deaths\\xe2\\x80\\x94DEA\\'s and DOJ\\'s duty is to keep those drugs off the streets\\nand to find and punish the criminals who push them. Through the CSA, Congress similarly\\nentrusted DEA with the responsibility for regulating legal opioids. DEA is responsible for\\nenforcing the CSA in a way that preserves legitimate patients\\' access to pain-relief medications\\nprescribed by their doctors while preventing diversion, misuse, and abuse. As such, Congress\\nhas charged DEA with regulating every step in the opioid supply chain.\\nWatchdog agencies have meticulously catalogued, however, myriad ways in which DEA has\\nfailed to safeguard the public from improper diversion of prescription opioids. In the shadow of\\ntheir own profound failures, DOJ and DEA now seek to retroactively impose on physicians\\nunworkable requirements that are not found in any law and go beyond what physicians are\\ntrained and licensed to perform- to investigate and arrest criminals.\\n\\nThe first question presented is:\\nDoes the Respondent\\'s unfairly tasking, and blaming the Petitioner for the DOJ/DEA\\nresponsibility violate the Petitioner\\'s Constitutional rights ?\\n\\nii\\n\\n\\x0cSecond Question.\\nOn January 22nd 2018, based on uncorroborated MAPS and wild lies, the State of Michigan\\nsuspended the Plaintiff\\'s controlled license. Speculation based on uncorroborated MAPS\\nreports is not credible,\" citing Michigan Aero Club v. Shelly, 283 Mich 401; 278 NW 121 (1938),\\n\\nThe second presented is :\\nWhether the Respondent usage of uncorroborated MAP violate the Due process clause ?\\n\\nThird Question.\\nThe medical-malpractice expert-testimony statute, MCL 600.2169, states that an expert witness\\nmust be licensed and, \"if [the defendant] is a specialist who is board certified, the expert\\nwitness must be a specialist who is board certified in that same specialty.\" MCL 600.2169(l)(a).\\nThe Petitioner is Board certified in Addiction Medicine. The Respondent\\'s expert witness, Dr.\\nDavid Nicolaou is board certified in Emergency Medicine. The Respondent\\'s second expert\\nwitness, Ms. Janice Waldmiller is only a Registered Pharmacy. The Petitioner objected to the\\ntwo offering any testimony. The respondent acting as the prosecutor and the judge disregarded\\nthe Petitioner\\'s objection. Both expert witnesses had no knowledge, to low quality\\nknowledge in chronic diseases and out patient settings, and drew inferences before knowing\\nall the facts.\\n\\nThe Third question presented is:\\nWhether the Respondent expert testimony was in violation of Due Process?\\n\\nFourth Question.\\niii\\n\\n\\x0cThe authors of the CDC guidelines Dr. Deborah Dowell, Dr. Tamara Haegerich and Dr, Roger\\nChou specifically stated that the CDC guidelines are only clinical recommendations, they are\\nNOT laws, rules or regulations. They do not have the effect of law.\\nThe Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own guidelines were more stringent than the CDC guidelines, see CDC,\\nGuidelinefor Prescribing Opioidsfor Chronic Pain (Mar. 18, 2016).\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/drugoverdose/pdf/Guidelines_At-A-Glance-508.pdf\\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that the Petition violated the CDC guidelines\\n\\nThe Fourth question presented is:\\nWhether CDC guidelines have effect of law?\\n\\nFifth Question.\\nThe court \"may not find substantial evidence \\'merely on the basis of evidence which in and of\\nitself justified [the agency\\'s decision], without taking into account contradictory evidence or\\nevidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.\"\\' Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v. NLRB,\\n347 F.3d 955, 962 {D.C. Cir. 2003) (quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 487,\\n71 S.Ct. 456, 95 LEd. 456 (1951)). And, while the agency is the ultimate factfinder, the\\nPlaintiff\\'s evidence and testimony are part of the record, and the record must be considered as\\na whole in order to see whether the result is supported by substantial evidence.\\nThe Fifth question presented is:\\nWhether it is proper for the Court to set aside a judgment if the whole record on file is not\\nreviewed?\\n\\nSixth Question.\\n\\niv\\n\\n\\x0cThe Petitioner was a respected professional in the community and has spent his life building a\\npositive reputation. Nevertheless, he uncovered that the Respondent has been maliciously\\nspreading inaccurate and unfounded information that is damaging to his personal and\\nprofessional character. The aforesaid defamatory statement has harmed Petitioner reputation;\\nsuch a statement has a tendency to injure and has injured the Petitioner in his occupation, his\\nfuture business and employment prospects have been severely harmed, the Petitioner has had\\nto incur substantial expense, in order to redress the harm he has suffered and continued to\\nsuffer.\\nUnder the laws in the State of Michigan, it is unlawful for an individual to make deliberate\\nstatements that intend to harm a person\\'s reputation without factual evidence or based on\\nhearsay.\\n\\nThe Sixth question presented is:\\nWhether uncovering of new evidence warrant review of a case?\\n\\n\\x0cQuestion Presented\\n\\nii-v\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\n,v- VI\\nvii-viii\\n\\nTable of Authorities\\n\\n1\\n\\nPetition for Writ Of Certiorari\\nOpinions Below\\n\\n1\\n\\nJurisdiction\\n\\n1\\n\\nConstitutional Provisions Involved\\n\\n1-16\\n\\nStatement of the Case\\n\\n6\\n\\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n16\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nvi\\n\\nExhibit A Administrative Complaint and Answers to the Complaint\\nExhibit B Judgment Dissolving Summary Suspension by Judge Erick Williams\\nExhibit C Oxycodone Records\\nExhibit D Oxymorphone Records\\nExhibit E Promethazine with Codeine Records\\nExhibit F Brief- Michigan Supreme Court\\nExhibit G Opinion of Michigan Court of Appeals\\nExhibit H Order of Michigan Supreme Court\\n\\nvi\\n\\n\\x0cCases\\nAss\\'n of the United States, Inc. v.

The Michigan Supreme Court\\ndenied review on March 30th 2021.\\n\\nJurisdiction\\nThe Petitioner\\'s appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court was declined to review on\\nMarch 30th 2021. The petitioner seeks review of the state-court decision, this Court\\'s\\njurisdiction is being invoked under 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa71257(a) having timely filed this petition for a writ\\nof certiorari within ninety days of the Michigan Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order.\\n\\nConstitutional Provisions Involved\\nUnited States Constitution, Amendment 5th and 14th Amendments.\\n\\nStatement of the Case\\nIn 2008, the Petitioner incorporated East & West Physicians, which he owns 100%. However, he\\ndidn\\'t do any business or treat any patients at East & West Physicians until August 2016. He\\ntreated his first patient at East & West Physicians on August 28,2016. The Plaintiff treated two\\ngroups of patients. The first group was the addiction group. The addiction group consisted of\\npatients who were battling mostly heroin. This group consisted of about 99% heroin addicts and\\nabout 1% were patients who were abusing and using prescription opioids in large quantities.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office was one of the office-based centers registered at the Substance Abuse\\nand Mental Health Services Administration (SAMBHSA) website. The Providers at this website\\nhad gone through training, taken tests and had been given special DEA numbers which permitted\\nthem to treat patients who had been battling opioid addictions especially heroin. The second\\ngroup consisted of other chronic cases. MB, JJ, LL, SK, BS and MO were all other chronic\\ncases. The six patients chosen for review by the Respondent, all had something in common. All\\nof them had pain score levels in the range of 8-10 out of 10.\\nIn October 2016, the Petitioner saw his first prescription fraud from Jefferson Pharmacy,\\nDetroit, Michigan. The Petitioner at that time informed the Respondent, Detroit DEA and filed\\nPolice report in Detroit etc. The Petitioner never had arresting power to arrest people. All what\\nthe Petitioner had to do was to wait for the law enforcements to effect the arrests of the\\nperpetrators, which never happened.\\n. In December 2016 the Petitioner pulled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMAPS\\xe2\\x80\\x9d report on MB and found out that MB had\\nfraudulently filled Oxycodone and Xanax 2mg at Meijier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pharmacy in East Lansing, about 70\\nmiles away from the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office location. The Petitioner tried to call MB to find out how\\nshe got the prescription. MB did not respond and the Petitioner filed police report with East\\nLansing Police (Case #1736400173). At that time Meijer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pharmacist had informed the\\nPetitioner that someone at the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office called Dana had verified the prescription. But\\nthere was no one at the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office called Dana. All the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employees denied\\nany involvement when questioned. In early April 2017, the State of Michigan requested for the\\ncharts of MB, BS, JJ, LL, MO, SK. When the Petitioner pulled MAP reports on JJ, LL, MO, he\\nfound out that the three had pulled the same scheme as MB did. The three had fraudulently filled\\nOxycodone and Xanax 2mg using the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credentials at Meijer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Pharmacies in Lansing,\\nMichigan and Dewitt, Michigan, about 70 miles away. At that time Lansing and Dewitt Police\\ndepartments refused to file police reports over the phone directing the Petitioner to the City of\\nSouthfield, the location of the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. When the Petitioner contacted the Southfield\\nPolice to file reports, they also refused, claiming that the prescriptions were filled at different\\nlocation, hence the Southfield Police had no jurisdictions. All the six were not even the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients in early April 2017 when the Michigan Board asked for their charts. SK\\nwas dropped in October 2016 due to Doctor shopping. BS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insurance did not pay for services\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cprovided due to networking problem. MB, JJ, LL, MO did not come back after the prescription\\nfraud scheme. In April 2017, the Petitioner wrote a letter to the Michigan Medical Board\\nreiterating that he had never written powerful pain medications such Oxycodone, Oxymorphone,\\nhydromorphone in his life. That any pain medication exceeding 30 MMED under his credentials,\\nshould be investigated right away.\\nTo give this Court a brief summary of what happened, in early May 2017 the Petitioner had a\\nmeeting with Janice Waldmiller Rph, a pharmacy inspector with the State of Michigan at\\nSouthfield Library concerning \\xe2\\x80\\x9c over prescribing of controlled medications\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. At that time the\\nPetitioner let Ms. Waldmiller know that his DEA number had been compromised and showed\\nher some police reports that he had filed. The Petitioner also let Ms. Waldmiller know that he\\ndid not prescribe powerful medications such as Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, hydromorphone,\\nMorphine, Xanax 2 mg etc. Next, the Petitioner let her know that he did not prescribe any pain\\nmedication that exceeded 30 Morphine Milligram Equivalent/day (30 MME/day). (Note the\\nMME/day per the state and federal standard is 90 MME/day). The Petitioner let Ms. Waldmiler\\nknow that any pain medication exceeding 30 MME/day, under the Petitioner warranted\\nimmediate investigation. Before parting the early May 2017 meeting, Ms. Waldmiller promised\\nthe Petitioner that she would come to the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office at a later date to show him more\\nprescriptions. On or around 31st May 2017, Ms Waldmiller came to the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office with\\na huge stack of prescriptions. Those were prescriptions for medications exceeding 30 MME. Ms.\\nWaldmiler and the Petitioner plugged the names on the prescriptions into the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncomputer, to check the names against the Petitioner \\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients\\' population. NOT a single match.\\nMs. Waldmiller advised the Plaintiff to contact the Detroit DEA and change his DEA number. In\\nJune 2017, the Petitioner spoke to Detroit DEA agent, Mr. Patrick Reimann. After hearing the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s story, Mr. Reimann and the Petitioner came to conclusion that changing the DEA\\nnumber alone would not solve the problem. Because the information on the prescriptions\\nmatched the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office information, it looked like the person behind the prescription\\nfrauds was someone closed to the Petitioner. That person would still get hold of the new DEA\\nnumber since the Petitioner had to be putting the numbers on the prescription pads. Mr.\\nReimann let the Petitioner know that the new vendor the State of Michigan had, allowed\\nproviders to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d themselves. In other words the new feature allowed providers to see people\\nwho had filled prescriptions under their credentials. That the Petitioner could\\xe2\\x80\\x9d MAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d himself\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cwhile he waited for the Police to apprehend the perpetrators. Right away the Petitioner contacted\\nthe vendor to learn how to use the new feature to MAP himself. The vendor spent hours over the\\nphone with the Petitioner but the new feature couldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t work for the Petitioner. Meanwhile the\\nprescription fraud continued and the Plaintiff kept on filing Police reports. The Plaintiff\\nencountered numerous Police abuses, humiliations and unwillingness to assist. That dampened\\nthe hope and the spirit of the Petitioner. It was only Warren Police Department which sent one\\nof the criminals to jail but the person went in for only 95 days. The person did not expose the\\nsource of the prescription frauds due to the light sentence. The person in question came all the\\nway from Grand Rapids , Michigan about 145 mile away, to Warren Michigan to fill\\nprescriptions for Norco (Hydrocodone and Acetominophin) and Promethazine with Codeine\\nunder the Petitioner s credentials. .The inactions of the area Police emboldened these criminals\\nto continue their criminal activities.\\n\\nIn October 2017 with the help of Safari Pharmacy in Detroit, Michigan, Ms. Krystalla Cross\\nMedical Assistant of the Plaintiff was caught red-handed verifying prescription of Norco (\\nHydrocodone and Acetominophen) and Promethazine with Codeine for someone called Macy\\nGlover, a person who had never been the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patient. The Petitioner has a voice\\nrecording of Ms Cross engaging in the prescription fraud using alias Anita (Transcript, 3/14/18,\\npp. 33, 214-218.)). Ms Cross worked for the Petitioner from September 2016 until she was\\ncaught and fired in October 2017. Krystalla Cross was fired and police reports filed. Krystalla\\nCross lied to the Petitioner for over a year. The person doing the prescription frauds was using\\ndifferent aliases to verify prescriptions and was mostly dealing with cooperating Pharmacists\\nand people who were not the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s patients. This made it difficult for the Petitioner to tie\\nthe frauds to a specific person or group. All the employees including Krystalla Cross were\\nquestioned several times and all of them including Krystalla Cross, each time steadfastly denied\\nany involvement. This went on until October 2017, that was when Krystalla Cross was caught\\nred-hand engaging in the prescription fraud using alias Anita (Transcript, 3/14/18, pp. 33,214218.)).\\nIn November 2017 the Petitioner found out from the head of MAPS, Mr. Andrew Hudson that\\nthe State of Michigan had blocked the Plaintiff from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMAPING\\xe2\\x80\\x9d himself preventing him from\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cseeing people who had filled prescription under his credentials. Making the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s problem\\nworse.\\nThe Petitioner was a respected professional in the community and had spent his life building a\\npositive reputation. The Petitioner had never had malpractice lawsuit filed against him in his\\nentire life and had unblemished reputation and was ready to meet with law enforcement agents\\nany time any day anywhere to give them the necessary and clean information to help them\\ninvestigate, arrest and prosecute. But the Detroit police were thinking about homicides not\\nprescription frauds.\\nThere were and still are a lot of patients in Detroit Metropolitan area. Even more than what the\\nPetitioner could see. Why would the Petitioner knowingly see patients who would give him\\ntrouble? There were a lot of apples, why would the Petitioner knowingly pick up the one which\\nwould give him a stomachache? Everything was done for legitimate medical purposes, and in\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood faith.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nHydrocodone is a semisynthetic, moderately potent, orally available opioid that, in combination\\nwith acetaminophen, is widely used for treatment of acute or chronic pain, and in combination\\nwith antihistamines or anticholinergics used to treat cough. The FDA indication for Norco\\n(Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen ) is for moderate to severe pain. Hydrocodone was first\\nmanufactured in 1920 and was introduced in the US market on March 23rd 1943. The half life of\\nhydrocodone is 4 hrs to 6 hrs. The medication is metabolized by the liver enzymes. Hydrocodone\\ndoes not stay in the human body forever. Medications taken several days ago may not show in\\nthe urine. For example JJ was seen on November 4th 2016 and he came back on December 8 ,\\n2016. JJ was given only 30 days medication with no refill. But JJ came back after 34 days, if JJ\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nurine drug screen was negative. That was correct, the medication had been eliminated from his\\nbody. As for the Codeine which is a pro drug and was given for a maximum of 10 days. If JJ,\\nLL, MO and MB came back after 30 days and the urine drug screens for codeine were negative.\\nThat was correct. The codeine had been eliminated from their bodies. The FDA indication for\\nPromethazine with Codeine is for cough. JJ, LL, MO MB received not more than 8 oz of this\\nmedication as needed which lasted from 7 to 10 days which was good for acute cough. Patients\\nwere seeing the Plaintiff once a month for monitoring and thorough assessments. Patients were\\nadvised that if they did not kick the bad risk habit such as continuing smoking, the cough would\\n5\\n\\n\\x0ccome back. All the six patients were smokers. Janice Waldmiller was always surrounded with\\ncontroversies because she had been drawing conclusions without any solid facts.\\nOn January 22nd 2018, based on uncorroborated Michigan Automated Prescription System\\n(MAPS) and fabricated evidence, the Respondent suspended the Petitioner license. Speculation\\nbased on uncorroborated MAPS reports is not credible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d citing Michigan Aero Club v. Shelly,\\n283 Mich 401; 278 NW 121 (1938), holding that a mere claim cannot stand in the place of\\nevidence and operate a proof; things not make to appear must be taken as not existing, *** Courts\\ndo not guess in the absence of evidence. [Emphasis added] Clements v. Clements, 2 Mich App\\n370; 139NW2d 918 (1966), holding that a Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision cannot rest on conjecture or\\nspeculation by an expert witness. The Petitioner through his then Attorneys filed answers to the\\ncomplaints and a motion to dissolve the summary suspension (Exhibit A). Hearings were held\\non that motion on March 12, March 14 and March 21, 2018. The hearing were filled with\\nfabricated evidence, lies and liars. Mr. Bruce Johnson, Mr. Timothy Erickson and Ms. Janice\\nWaldmiller came to the hearing with fabricated evidence, names on some prescriptions scratched\\nout with black pens, witnesses coached to lie on the stand and most of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d used\\n#\\n\\nagainst the Petitioner concealed. The Petitioner had never written a single Oxymorphone in his\\nlife, yet he was ranked 21st among the Michigan doctors. The Petitioner had never written a\\nsingle Oxycodone in his life yet he was ranked 26th. The Petitioner had never written a single\\nXanax 2mg in his life, yet he was ranked. The Petitioner had never written Promethazine with\\nCodeine 16 oz (Exhibit E) yet he was ranked number one and the list went on and on. The\\nRespondent victimized the Petitioner by fueling a media circus with outright lies. On March\\n23rd 2018, after three day hearings, Judge Williams saw through the lies and dissolved the\\nsuspension ( Exhibit B ). That was when everything was opened for the Petitioner to \"map\"\\nhimself and view everything for the first time. The Petitioner was shocked to find what he saw.\\nThousands of prescriptions filled under his credentials by these criminals who were not even his\\npatients (Please see Exhibits C,D,E for few of the criminals). In fact, the Petitioner learned from\\nthe Canton city Police that some of the names of the people featured on the MAPS under the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credentials were fictitious and not even real. The Respondent freely injected lies into\\nevidence.\\nThe medical-malpractice expert-testimony statute, MCL 600.2169, states that an expert witness\\nmust be licensed and, \"if [the defendant] is a specialist who is board certified, the expert witness\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cmust be a specialist who is board certified in that same specialty.\" MCL 600.2169( 1 )(a). Dr.\\nDavid Nicolaou, the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expert witness was not competent and was not qualified to testify.\\nThe plain language of MCL 600.2I69(l)(a) precluded Dr. David Nicolaou, the State expert\\nwitness from offering any testimony regarding the applicable standard of practice or care, the\\nPetitioner is board certified in Addiction Medicine by the American Board of Addiction\\nMedicine and the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expert witness Dr. Nicolaou is board certified in Emergency Medicine.\\nThat was a big mistake. Here is ER Physician Vs Out Patient Physician. Acute Conditions Vs\\nChronic Conditions. General Practice Vs. Subspecialty. Huge knowledge gap. Dr. Nicolaou\\nmade inferences without solids facts. Anybody who is well versed in medicine knows that Dr.\\nNicolaou cannot compare himself with the Petitioner. For a Provider to be able to manage a\\ndisease very well, that Provider should know the pathogenesis of the disease. The Provider\\nshould also know the Pharmacodynamics and Pharmacokinetics of the medications being used.\\nSomething Dr Nicolaou disagreed and did not know. Dr. Nicolaou even did not know the basic\\nconversions of MME of opioids. Dr Nicolaou himself raised the issue of Oxycodone 90 mg.\\nWhen asked the MME of that, Dr. Nicolaou was up 5 point. (135 vs 140). There is no room for\\nerrors in medicine. Providers are dealing with human lives not woods or metals. Dr. Nicolaou\\nthought Tussionex is a single medication (Hydrocodone). He didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t even know its indication.\\nTUSSIONEX- Pennkinetic is a combination of hydrocodone, an opioid agonist; and\\nchlorpheniramine, a histamine-1 (HI) receptor antagonist, indicated for the temporary relief of\\ncough and upper respiratory symptoms associated with allergy or the common cold in patients 18\\nyears of age and older]. And the list goes on and on. When the Petitioner tried to correct Dr.\\nNicolaou so that they would be on the same page, Dr Nicolaou started running his mouth and\\nbecame belligerent. After the first day, when Dr. Nicolaou saw that the Petitioner would not be a\\ncool walk, Dr. Nicolaou decided to testify over the phone. The Petitioner wanted Dr. Nicolaou to\\ntestify in person. The Petitioner Verses Dr. Nicolaou. There would have been\\xe2\\x80\\x9d medical\\nhematomas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nDr Nicolaou tried to take a jab at the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notes. Doctors are not required to spend their\\nwhole time writing thesis about their patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 visits .Providers are required to make reasonable\\nefforts to document their patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 visits. Templates are created to assist doctors with\\ndocumentations. So that the Providers get and spend ample time with their patients. Patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ncharts are susceptible to criticisms and the Petitioner as an MD, MPH, MRO, FASAM and a\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cdiplomate of American board of addiction medicine, can rip up Dr. Nicolaou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notes within\\nseconds, if the Petitioner wants to be critical of Nicollaou. If a Provider has no notes on a patient\\nthat he/she saw, then that is a problem. Every Provider is required to make a reasonable effort to\\nwrite notes on a patient he/she saw. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSOAP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d notes formats are the same, whether in the\\nSoviet Union, in the United States or in Hong Kong . The \\xe2\\x80\\x98S\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is for the Patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subjective\\nfeeling . The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cO\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objective findings. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the Provider\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Assessments\\nand Diagnosis and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the Plan. The SOAP notes is basic knowledge which even every\\nfirst year Medical Student knows and writes well. In Boyd v Wynadotte, 402 Mich 98,104-105;\\n260 NW2d 439 (1977), the Michigan Supreme Court affirmatively stated that evidence of an\\nalleged breach that didn\\'t cause any harm has \"no bearing on whether defendants were\\nnegligent.\" The Court also held that the negligent record-keeping theory \"would have no bearing\\non whether a defendant was negligent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d .\\nThe initial position of the Respondent was that the Petitioner was \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverprescribing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. When that\\ntheory sank like titanic, Mr. Johnson and Co quickly shifted their position to asserting that the\\nCDC guidelines were somehow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cviolated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The CDC guidelines are only clinical\\nrecommendations, they are NOT laws, rules or regulations . They do not have the effect of law.\\nThe Judge Williams correctly quoted the authors on Recommendation No. 11, which is in\\ncontention. That section refers to the fact that the recommendation that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclinicians should avoid\\nprescribing opioid pain medication and benzodiazepines concurrently whenever possible, PFD,\\np. 18. [Emphasis added] That, of course, clearly means that these medications can certainly be\\nused in certain cases such as the cases of patients MB and BS, and thus the mere use of them\\ncannot be construed as proving a violation of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstandard of care.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Both MB and BS had the\\ndual diagnosis of severe pain and severe anxiety and were treated properly as the medical\\nliteratures recommended.\\nEarlier pain research listed the overall prevalence of comorbid anxiety disorders and pain as\\nranging between 16.5% and 28.8%.l However, newer studies suggest that anxiety disorders may\\nbe present in up to 60% of patients with chronic pain. (See, FN 3, supra). It is well published in\\nthe medical literature that both ailments (Lower Back pain and Anxiety) should be treated\\nconcurrently for effective results.\\n1 McWilliams LA, Goodwin RD, Cox BJ. Depression and Anxiety Associated with Three Pain Conditions: Results from a\\nNationally Representative Sample. Pain. 2004;! 11(1-2); 77\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cWe believe but we would check. (^OBepafi ho npoBepaft). When MB, JJ, LL and OM turned\\nout to be dishonest and criminals by engaging in prescription frauds, using the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncredentials, the four were immediately terminated from the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clinic and appropriate\\nauthorities (DEA and Police) notified. Patients would never confide to a Doctor, their\\nunderlying fears and embarrassing information if they perceived that the Doctor was indifferent,\\njudgmental or hostile. So the Petitioner never exhibited that kind of behavior to patients. The\\nopioid contract emphasized on the risks of substance use and overdose associated with controlled\\nsubstances containing an opioid. Mixing opioids with benzodiazepines, alcohol, muscle\\nrelaxants, etc. For female who were pregnant or were of reproductive age, the heightened risk of\\nshort and long term effect of opioids including but not limited to neonatal abstinence syndromes\\nwere stress. Safe disposal of opioids and safe storage of medications to prevent family members\\nfrom reaching them also stressed. The patients were informed by the Petitioner, what the contract\\nstressed, that it was a felony to illegally deliver, distribute or share controlled substances without\\na prescription properly issued by a licensed health care prescriber and all the patients verbalized\\nunderstanding of the contract provided. Everything was instituted to combat diversions. All the\\nsix patients were seen for legitimate medical purposes, and in good faith as the Petitioner\\nextensively testified.\\nThe Subcommittee also came in later to make a farce of the administrative process. Mr. Johnson\\nand his group had converted the Subcommittee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s functions to a conveyor belt of convictions\\nbased on fabricated evidence. The Respondent who was the prosecutor and the Judge also made\\nuse of the\\xe2\\x80\\x9d local effect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9c Ottawa road\\xe2\\x80\\x9d effect to bulldozer its way through the\\nState\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judicial system. At the core of a real fair judicial system is the unfettered right to due\\nprocess and equal protection of the law . The Michigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is stunningly\\none-sided in its focus and, thus, utterly arbitrary and capricious. As indicated in the brief, the\\ntranscripts and the exhibits, the Petitioner presented extensive testimonies and provided\\nnumerous evidence pertaining to each of these disputed facts, though one would not know it\\nfrom the Appeals Court Opinion analysis. The Petitioner was not even present when the\\nSubcommittee met. In fact the Petitioner did not know that there was a meeting and no one\\nrepresented him over there. Because the Petitioner rightly refused to accept responsibility for\\nsomething he had NOT done. The Subcommittee meted on the Petitioner, the harshest\\npunishment. Suspending his license for six months ( 6 months) and one day (1 day),\\ncommencing May 5th 2019 and fifteen thousand dollar ($15000.00) fine. The Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncontrolled substance license revoked and Ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) fine imposed. The\\nPetitioner appealed the decision to all the way to the Michigan Supreme Court. The Petitioner\\nfiled the reply brief himself. (Exhibit F). On March 30th, 2021, the Michigan Supreme Court\\ndeclined to review the case stating that the question presented by the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s then attorney is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot for this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ( Exhibit G). The Michigan Supreme Court failed to state which Court the\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cquestion is for.\\nAnother strange thing, the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case was scheduled for oral argument on May 5th 2020 via\\nzoom. The oral argument was suspiciously cancelled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdue to Covid 19\\xe2\\x80\\x9d . The Petitioner saw that\\nhis then Attorneys had been very ineffective and had not done a good job with the brief and the\\nPetitioner was looking forwarding to answering any questions which the Justices might have.\\nEven though all the answers can be found in the five day hearings/ transcripts, everyone knows\\nthat no Court would spend that much time going through all the five day transcripts. Cancelling\\nthe oral argument adversely affected the Petitioner. The oral argument was cancelled due to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCovid 19\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. If the oral argument was going to be done via zoom, then the risk of infection was\\nzero. The Petitioner does not want to sound redundant. The Michigan Supreme Court Reply\\nBrief written by the Petitioner (Exhibit F) answers all the questions raised in the Appeals\\nCourt.\\nThe Michigan Court of Appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion cannot withstand review, because it fails to consider\\ncontradictory record evidence where such evidence is precisely on point. Such a lapse of\\nreasonable and fair decision making is particularly acute where, as here, the opinion entirely\\nignores the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidence and testimony (Exhibit G). The Michigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision is stunningly one-sided in its focus and, thus, utterly arbitrary and capricious.\\nThe court \"may not find substantial evidence \\'merely on the basis of evidence which in and of\\nitselfjustified [the agency\\'s decision], without taking into account contradictory evidence or\\nevidence from which conflicting inferences could be drawn.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\" Lakeland Bus Lines, Inc. v.\\nNLRB, 347 F.3d 955, 962 (D.C.

Const. 1963, art. 6, \\xc2\\xa7 28, provides, in relevant part:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c All final decisions, findings, rulings and orders of any administrative officer\\nor agency existing under the constitution or by law, which are judicial or quasi-judicial and affect\\nprivate rights or licenses, shall be subject to direct review by the courts as provided by law. This\\nreview shall include, as a minimum, the determination whether such final decisions, findings,\\nrulings and orders are authorized by law; and, in cases in which a hearing is required, whether\\nthe same are supported by competent, material and substantial evidence on the whole record\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nA court must review the entire record, not just the portions that support an agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings,\\nwhen assessing \"whether an agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision was supported by competent, material, and\\nsubstantial evidence on the whole recordf.J\" Risch, 274 Mich.App. at 372, 733 N.W.2d 403.\\n\"Substantial evidence\" means \"evidence that a reasonable person would accept as sufficient to\\nsupport a conclusion.\" Id. This may be substantially less than a preponderance of evidence, but\\ndoes require more than a scintilla of evidence. Id. For purposes of Const. 1963, art. 6, \\xc2\\xa7 28, a\\ndecision is not \"authorized by law\" when it is in violation of a statute or a constitutional\\nprovision, in excess of an agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statutory authority or jurisdiction, made upon unlawful\\nprocedure that results in material prejudice, or when it is arbitrary and capricious. Northwestern\\nNat\\xe2\\x80\\x991 Cas. Co. v.Comm\\xe2\\x80\\x99r of Ins., 231 Mich.App. 483, 488, 586 N.W.2d 563 (1998).\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opioid contract and SOAP notes emphasized on the risks of substance use and\\noverdose associated with controlled substances containing an opioid. Mixing opioids with\\nbenzodiazepines, alcohol, muscle relaxants, etc. For female who were pregnant or were of\\nreproductive age, the heightened risk of short and long term effect of opioids including but not\\nlimited to neonatal abstinence syndromes were stress. Safe disposal of opioids and safe storage\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cof medications to prevent family members from reaching them also stressed. The patients were\\ninformed by the Petitioner, what the contract stressed, that it was a felony to illegally deliver,\\ndistribute or share controlled substances without a prescription properly issued by a licensed\\nhealth care prescriber and all the patients verbalized understanding of the contract provided.\\nEverything was instituted to combat diversions. The other diversion enforcement area such as\\ninvestigations, arrests and prosecutions were supposed to be done by the Detroit DEA and local\\npolice. In Detroit Metropolitan area, the DEA and the local police enforcements have woefully\\nfailed.\\nThe Respondent acting under the color of the State law violated the Due Process Clause which is\\nenshrined in both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States constitution. Such\\nas:\\n1 - The right to an unbiased trial\\n2- The right of being aware of all evidence against him\\n3- The right to freely cross-examine witnesses\\n4- The right to freely present evidence\\nThe Michigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is stunningly one-sided in its focus and, thus, utterly\\narbitrary and capricious..\\nThe Michigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions that the whole evidence/records were examined were\\nfar-fetched. If the Appeals Court had examined the whole evidence/records as required by law\\nbefore arriving at conclusions, the Appeals Court would have found the following:\\n1) Dr. Nicolaou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualifications and knowledge were challenged from day one. Nicolaou\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and\\nthe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualifications and knowledge do not match.\\n2) Ms. Janice Waldmiller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualifications and knowledge were challenged. Mr. Bruce Johnson\\nhad to step in and stop the Petitioner from cross examining to save Ms. Waldmiller. Ms.\\nWaldmiller was RPh not PharmD. Her knowledge showed. It was abysmal. The Petitioner did\\nnot mean to humiliate her, he wanted to see whether she knew what she was charged to\\ninvestigate. Ms. Waldmiller drew conclusions without knowing the basic facts. Waldmiller\\nknowingly lied on the stand\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c3) Krystalla Cross is a liar, not credible and prescription fraudster who was caught red-handed\\nand fired. To cover her covert prescription frauds, she used aliases to verify prescriptions for her\\ncriminals. When Krystalla Cross\\xe2\\x80\\x99 criminal activities were uncovered, she lost all the respects the\\npatients had for her. Cross is still walking free because Mr. Bruce Johnson, Michigan Assistant\\nAttorney has pardoned her in exchanged for her manufactured lies. Krystalla Cross is not\\ncredible. The Petitioner has a voice recording of Ms Cross engaging in the prescription fraud\\nusing alias Anita (Transcript, 3/14/18, pp. 33, 214-218.)).\\n4) Dr Uche Obua, a Nurse Practitioner who has two PHD Degrees, is credible and has\\nimpeccable reputation. Highly respected by all patients. He refuted Cross\\xe2\\x80\\x99 accusations that the\\nPetitioner saw Patients in group and wrote prescriptions before seeing patients. Krystalla Cross\\nwas simply a spiteful and angry former employee who was caught red-handed doing\\nprescription fraud and got fired. Police report was filed against her.\\n5) Akeela Noel, the Office Manager is credible with clean record and well respected by all the\\npatients.\\n6) Francina Kirk, a Medical Assistant is credible with clean record and well respected by all the\\npatients.\\n7) The CDC guidelines are clinical recommendations. The Authors of the guidelines have\\nmightily stated that the CDC guidelines are NOT laws, NOT rules and NOT regulations. The\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guidelines were more stringent than the CDC guidelines.\\n8) Every patient was schooled on the risks and benefits of all medications and treatments. Every\\npatient signed opioid contract in which the risks and benefits of opioids Benzos, muscle relaxants\\netc well laid out.\\n9) The Petitioner had plan in place to stamp out diversion by seeing and monitoring Patients\\nmonthly. Patients who received opioids were given not more than 30MMED (30 vs 90), lower\\nquantity, MAPS pulled before Patients were given controlled medication. Refills never put on\\ncontrolled medications to limit access and quantity. Frequent toxicology performed etc. Drug\\nDiversion preventions are multifunctional, interdepartmental and involve investigations.\\nMaintain data base of cases. Assure proper reporting to authorities before case closed. The\\nPetitioner gave the Detroit DEA and several Michigan local police departments wealth of\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cinformation. But those Authorities failed to act on, making the cases continued as long as they\\ndid. Krystalla Cross would have been caught earlier.\\n10) All Patients were informed that it was a felony to illegally deliver, distribute or share\\ncontrolled substances as spelt out in the contracts.\\n11) The Patients who breached any part of the contracts were terminated and the appropriate\\nauthorization informed, if indicated.\\n12) All Patients counseled on prescription drugs and street drug during every visit. Opioid and\\nBenzos never given concurrently whenever possible.\\n13) Mr. Johnson and Co had been making inferences without proofs.\\n14) The State of Michigan, through its employees knowingly lied, concealed evidence, and\\nblocked proper Due Process. All the witnesses the Respondent presented had been coached to lie.\\n\\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT\\nReasons for Granting the Petition\\nJ. State supreme courts are divided on the question\\npresented.\\nIT. The case presents an issue of national importance.\\nIII. The Michigan Supreme Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is incorrect.\\nAt the core of a real fair judicial system is the unfettered right to due process and equal\\nprotection of the law . The Michigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is stunningly one-sided in its\\nfocus and, thus, utterly arbitrary and capricious. As indicated in the brief and the exhibits, the\\nPetitioner presented extensive testimonies and evidence pertaining to each of these disputed\\nfacts, though one would not know it from the Appeals Court Opinion analysis.\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cThe Respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings, and conclusions were arbitrary, capricious. The Respondent abused\\nits discretion. The Respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action were not in accordance with law and were contrary to\\nconstitutional right, power, privilege/ immunity. The Respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s action were\\nin excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority/ limitations, and short of statutory right and\\nwithout observance of procedure required by law.\\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion is unsupported by substantial evidence provided by\\nstatute. The Michigan Appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion is unwarranted by the facts to the extent that the\\nfacts are subject to trial de novo by the reviewing court.\\nIn making the foregoing determinations, the court shall review the whole record or those parts of\\nit cited by a party, and due account shall be taken of the rule of prejudicial error.\\nThis Court adopted a set of prophylactic measures to protect the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Due Process Clause\\nenshrined in both 5th and 14th Amendments.\\nThe decision by the Court of Appeals is plainly incorrect, as it both contradicts the bright-line\\nholding of MCL 600.2169 and the express purpose of the rule.\\nThe present case is a textbook example of the arm strong arm tactics the Respondent has been\\nusing to crash Innocent Physician. Despite having clearly invoked his right to qualified expert\\nwitness, the Petitioner was nonetheless placed in \\xe2\\x80\\x9can interrogation room\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and subjected to\\nthe Respondent who had no legitimate reason for doing so. Despite observing that the\\nRespondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions violated MCL 600.2169, the Court of Appeals then proceeded with its\\nanalysis without any acknowledgement that the Respondent actions have affected the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nConstitutional Rights. Making most vulnerable Physicians to feel that the invocation of the right\\nto qualified expert is meaningless:\\nThe Court of Appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 erroneous decision circumvents this premise, effectively\\npermitting the Respondent the right to use strong-arm tactic and break the law.\\nNext, the Respondent invoked the CDC guidelines for Opioid prescribing. Well, the authors of\\nthe CDC guidelines Dr. Deborah Dowell, Dr. Tamara Haegerich and Dr, Roger Chou\\nspecifically and publicly stated that the CDC guidelines are only clinical recommendations, they\\nare NOT laws, rules or regulations . They do not have the effect of law. The Respondent has\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cbeen trying to shamelessly distort the CDC guidelines to make them fit its narrative of the\\napplicable standard of practice or care. The CDC guidelines have no applicable standard for\\npatients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assessments and notes writing.\\nLastly, Congress entrusted DEA\\xe2\\x80\\x94not Physicians \\xe2\\x80\\x94with the responsibility, tools, and legal\\nauthority to investigate, arrest and prosecute criminals and bad actors who want to make it bad\\nfor legitimate Patients. The Respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal contentions about the duties of Physicians\\ncannot be found anywhere in the text of the Controlled Substance Act (the CSA) or in any DEA\\nregulation. At most, the Respondent has stitched its untested position together from scattered and\\ninformal letters and PowerPoint presentations by its officials. But these documents are not law,\\nas DOJ has recently reaffirmed in rules and other public statements. In any event, the\\nRespondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opioid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguidance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is often inconsistent or even irreconcilable with the expert\\njudgment of federal health agencies, and with other state practice of medicine and pharmacy\\nlaws.\\nThis case presents this Court with an opportunity to clarify. Absent intervention by this Court,\\nthe Michigan Court of Appeals\\' opinion will work to undermine the carefully-crafted procedural\\nsafeguards and rule of law that this Court and Congress have spent years developing. The\\nMichigan Appeals Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is stunningly one-sided in its focus and, thus, utterly\\narbitrary and capricious.\\n\\nX. CONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Petitioner respectfully requests that this Honorable Court\\nissue a writ of certiorari to review the opinion of the Michigan Court of Appeals.\\nRespectfully Submitted\\n/s/ Solomon Adu-Beniako\\nSOLOMON ADU-BENIAKO\\n\\nDATED June 28, 2021.\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c'\n",

Accordingly, the presumption at\\nthe outset of this case was that museums are cultural\\ninstitutions dedicated to enriching the public sphere\\nand should therefore be immunized to infringement\\nliability (unless Petitioner showed otherwise). The\\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed,\\nresting primarily on the status and identity of\\nRespondent as a non-profit museum which, by its very\\nnature, functions to display historical artifacts or other\\nworks deemed of cultural significance.\\nThe\\nDistrict\\nCourt\\nidentified\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthree\\ndimensions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of transformativeness: (1) the Met used\\nthe Photograph as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistorical artifact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to represent\\nthe Frankenstein guitar in action; (2) the Met used the\\nPhotograph in a scholarly context, i.e. a museum; and\\n\\n\\x0c2\\n(3) the Photograph was published on-line along with\\nhundreds, if not thousands of other photographs.\\nBut all three dimensions identified by the\\nDistrict Court could be applied to virtually any\\nsecondary use of any photograph by a museum such\\nas The Met. As to the first dimension, in every case\\nwhere a photograph has, through the passage of time,\\nacquired historical significance, a court could simply\\ndetermine transformativeness as a matter of law,\\nthereby stripping a vintage photograph of protection.\\nThe\\nsecond\\ndimension\\nalso\\noperates\\ngenerically, as such finding would apply to any work\\nof art displayed in a museum, because museums serve\\na scholarly function (at least in part).\\nAs to the third dimension, this factor can also\\nbe applied generically to any photograph on The Met\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\non-line catalogue. It would always be the case that a\\nsingle photograph shown on the Met\\xe2\\x80\\x99s on-line\\ncatalogue would co-exist with hundreds, maybe\\nthousands, of other images.\\nNotably, Respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the Photograph\\nhere was not \\xe2\\x80\\x9creduced size\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Rather, Respondent\\nexpropriated a full scale, full-color reproduction of the\\nPhotograph and placed it on prominent display on its\\nwebsite as a means to advertise its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrick and mortar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nexhibition of the Frankenstein guitar. Even though\\nthe Photograph was used to explain to the public why\\nthe Frankenstein guitar embodied any significance at\\nall, the District Court described the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use\\nof the Photograph as \\xe2\\x80\\x9calmost an afterthought.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nIn short, all three dimensions identified by the\\nDistrict Court, as affirmed by the Court of Appeals,\\nare geared towards the identical concept: that\\nmuseums have an unfettered right to display\\nphotographs as a means to illustrate the historical\\nsignificance of exhibits on showcase, without\\npermission from the copyright holder.\\nThere is no question that Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s photograph\\nhas historical value. The same can be said for any\\nphotograph of any Rock n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Roll icon: Janis Joplin, Jimi\\nHendrix, Jim Morrison, etc. But that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s all the more\\nreason why museums such as The Met need to obtain\\nthe Artist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permission to exhibit their work: because\\nthe work appreciates over time.\\nPetitioner has a right to be compensated for\\ncreating an iconic image that a prestigious museum\\nwants to display for its paying clientele. The Met\\nshould pay the fair price, credit the photographer and\\nestablish a protocol moving forward for seeking\\npermission from photographers to display their work\\nto its patrons.\\nIn sum, the Second Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overly broad\\napplication of the fair use doctrine should be rejected,\\nand the Court should reverse the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nruling and remand this case for further proceedings.\\nOPINIONS BELOW\\nThe Second Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion, dated April 2,\\n2021 is reported as 844 Fed.Appx. 436.

Marano is in the business of\\nlicensing his photographs for a fee.\\nThe Met is a sophisticated purveyor of\\ncopyrighted works which operates a website at the\\nURL www.metmuseum.org (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWebsite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) and a\\nbrick-and-mortar museum at The Met Fifth Avenue,\\nNew York.

AcuffRose Music, Inc., 510 U.S. at 579 (1994). The central\\npurpose of the inquiry is to determine whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nnew work merely supersedes the objects of the original\\ncreation, or instead adds something new, with a\\nfurther purpose or different character, altering the\\nfirst with new expression, meaning, or message.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nRinggold v. Black Entertainment Television, Inc., 126\\nF.3d 70, 79 (2d Cir. 1997) (citations omitted).\\nThe Court of Appeals determined that the\\nsecondary use was transformative as a matter of law\\nbecause The Met\\xe2\\x80\\x99s exhibition used the Photograph to\\nhighlight the Guitar rather than Van Halen. The\\nCourt of Appeals also found that the Photograph was\\ndisplayed in connection with text which described the\\nhistorical significance of the Guitar (as well as other\\ninstruments).\\nHowever, use of a photograph to describe the\\ncontent depicted in the image is not transformative.\\nSee, e.g., Cruz v. Cox Media Grp., LLC, 444 F. Supp.\\n\\n\\x0c10\\n3d 457 (E.D.N.Y. 2020) (secondary use of a photograph\\nof a terrorist suspect held not transformative where\\nnews organization published a descriptive report of\\nthe arrest); Otto v.

Had the Met used the Photograph itself as\\nthe object of a museum exhibition, for example, to\\nspotlight the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTop Ten Iconic Images of Rock Stars,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nor to comment on the artistic merits of the\\nPhotograph, or historical significance of Rock n Roll\\nimagery in general, or to highlight the professional\\nlives of Rock n Roll photographers, then maybe the\\nMet would have a colorable claim of transformative\\nuse of the Photograph.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nBut neither the Website\\xe2\\x80\\x99s display of the\\nPhotograph nor the Play It Loud Exhibition say\\nanything whatsoever about the Photograph. Indeed,\\nprior to the filing of this lawsuit, the Website\\ncontained no information about the photographer, the\\ndate when the Photograph was taken, where the\\nPhotograph was taken, or information about how the\\nPhotograph was captured.\\nA secondary user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wholesale reproduction of a\\nPhotograph to show the historical significance of\\nobjects depicted in the Photograph should not be\\nconsidered transformative as a matter of law. Such\\nstandard threatens to strip virtually every\\nphotograph of its copyright protection because no\\nphotograph is immune to the passage of time. The fact\\nthat the subject matter of the Photograph has\\nacquired historical significance over time should be of\\nno legal import in the transformative inquiry, as the\\nsame could be said for virtually any photograph.\\nIn sum, because The Met failed to use the\\nPhotograph itself as the object of its museum\\nexhibition; but instead used it to merely describe the\\ncontent depicted in the issue, there can be no\\ntransformative effect.\\nPOINT II:\\n\\nIT IS PLAUSIBLE THAT THE MET\\xe2\\x80\\x99S\\nUSE WAS COMMERCIAL RATHER\\nTHAN NON-PROFIT\\n\\nThe first statutory factor specifically instructs\\ncourts to consider whether copyrighted materials are\\nused for a commercial purpose or for a nonprofit\\n\\n\\x0c12\\neducational purpose, the former tending to weigh\\nagainst a finding of fair use. Campbell, 510 U.S. at\\n585.\\nHere, the Court of Appeals determined that The\\nMet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use was not commercial because The Met is a\\nnon-profit organization that was established as a\\nmuseum and because the Website does not charge\\nadmission to view photographs on-line. However, that\\ndoesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t mean The Met hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t acquired conspicuous\\nfinancial reward from the Play it Loud Exhibition. The\\nrecord shows that the Met used the Photograph to\\nadvertise its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbrick-and-mortar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Exhibition, which\\nrequired payment of substantial fees to enter for outof-state visitors (contrary to the Court of Appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nconclusion, a $25 ticket is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnominal fee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for the\\ngreat majority of citizens).\\nThe Met invited web users to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy Tickets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake a Donation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d directly above display of the\\nPhotograph. This supports Marano\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position that the\\nPhotograph was being used to solicit visitor interest\\nand generate income for the Met. Such use could be\\ndeemed commercial.

[See Rothenberg,\\nDkt. #30] The district court denied the Rule 12(b)(6)\\nmotion as premature, finding that it was preferable to\\ndevelop a factual record of the fair use defense for\\npurpose of summary judgment.

At the pleading stage, it is\\nentirely plausible that fans of Van Halen (the very\\nsame people who would likely be interesting in\\nviewing Van Halen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guitar on display on Met) would\\nalso want to license the Photograph for vintage Tshirts or memorabilia. It is also plausible that\\ncompeting museums, such as the Rock \\xe2\\x80\\x98n Roll Hall of\\nFame in Cleveland, would be interesting in licensing\\nphotographs for historical exhibitions. Discovery is\\nneeded to determine what markets actually or\\npotentially exist for the Photograph and how the Met\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsecondary use impacts those markets.\\nIn the end, Marano is entitled to collect\\nlicensing fees in whatever reasonably expected\\npotential markets may exist. See Michael Grecco\\nProds., Inc. v. Valuewalk, LLC, 345 F. Supp. 3d 482,\\n508\\xe2\\x80\\x9309 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe inquiry [of the fourth\\nfactor] looks to whether infringement will affect the\\npotential market for the copyrighted work in\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional, reasonable, or likely to be developed\\nmarkets.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (emphasis added).\\n\\n\\x0c20\\nAt this stage of the proceeding, it is unclear\\nwhether the Met licenses photographic content for use\\nin its on-line catalogue.

What is particularly troubling about this\\ntrend is the binary nature of the inquiry, meaning that\\na district court declares a secondary use as either\\ntransformative or not transformative \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and then all of\\nthe other factors get subsumed into the binary\\nanalysis.\\nBut the Court should recognize that the\\ntransformative inquiry is a matter of degree. District\\ncourts should be required to measure the\\ntransformativeness of a secondary work through a\\nseries of gradations, e.g., not transformative,\\nminimally (or marginally) transformative, moderately\\ntransformative, or highly transformative, so as to\\nprovide this Court the opportunity to conduct a\\nmeaningful review.\\nBy recognizing the various\\ngradations, courts will have a better idea of which\\nuses can be declared transformative as a matter of law\\n(or not), versus which uses should be reserved for the\\nfact-finder.

Caproni, J.). In 2019, Marano\\nbrought a copyright action against the Metropolitan\\nMuseum of Art (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Marano alleged that the\\nMet infringed his copyright by featuring a 1982\\nphotograph he took of Eddie Van Halen playing his\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guitar (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPhoto\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in an exhibition of\\n\\n\\x0c4a\\nrock n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roll instruments on the Met\\'s website. After\\nbriefing on the fair use exception of the Copyright Act,\\n17 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 107, the district court dismissed Marano\\'s\\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim, finding that\\nMarano had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailed to show why the Met\\'s use of [the\\nPhoto] is not protected by the fair use exception.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d *438\\nMarano v.

Aug. 14, 2020).\\nWe assume the reader\\'s familiarity with the record.\\nMarano challenges the district court\\'s determination\\nthat the Met\\'s display of the Photo in its exhibition\\nconstitutes fair use. For the reasons stated below, we\\naffirm the judgment of the district court.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSection 107 of the Copyright Act permits the\\nunauthorized use or reproduction of copyrighted work\\nif it is \\xe2\\x80\\x98for purposes such as criticism, comment, news\\nreporting, teaching ..., scholarship, or research.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill\\nGraham Archives v.

These factors \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust be viewed\\ncollectively, with their results \\xe2\\x80\\x98weighed together, in\\nlight of the purposes of copyright,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d namely, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto\\npromote progress in science and art.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d TCA Television\\nCorp. v.

We\\nbegin with the first factor \\xe2\\x80\\x94often framed as whether\\nthe use is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransformative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94which constitutes the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cheart of the fair use inquiry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blanch v.

The\\nMet\\'s exhibition transformed the Photo by\\nforegrounding the instrument rather than the\\nperformer. Whereas Marano\\'s stated purpose in\\ncreating the Photo was to show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat Van Halen\\n\\n\\x0c6a\\nlooks like in performance,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App\\'x at 29, the Met\\nexhibition highlights the unique design of the\\nFrankenstein guitar and its significance in the\\ndevelopment of rock n\\xe2\\x80\\x99 roll instruments. Further, the\\nPhoto appears alongside other photographs showing\\nthe physical composition of the guitar, which are\\ncollectively accompanied by text discussing the\\nguitar\\'s genesis, specifications, and impact on rock n\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nroll music, not Van Halen\\'s biography or discography.\\nThis context \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadds something new, with a further\\npurpose or different character, altering the [Photo]\\nwith new expression, meaning, or message.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCampbell, 510 U.S. at 579, 114 S.Ct. 1164.\\nMarano contends that the Met\\'s display of the Photo\\nis not sufficiently transformative for fair use because\\nthe Met charges admission and provides\\nentertainment. Yet the Met was founded \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor the\\npurpose of establishing and maintaining in [New\\nYork City] a Museum and library of art,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it\\nremains a nonprofit that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccollects, studies, conserves,\\nand presents significant works of art.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App\\'x 70.\\nAlthough the Met charges a nominal fee to out-ofstate visitors who visit the physical museum, the\\nmuseum\\'s website\\xe2\\x80\\x94the subject of Marano\\'s *439\\ncopyright claim\\xe2\\x80\\x94is both free and publicly available,\\nserving to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextend [the Met\\'s] cultural and academic\\nreach ... by welcoming without charge millions of\\nvirtual visitors every year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App\\'x 44, 95. These\\npurposes are not commercial; to the contrary, they\\nalign the Met\\'s fair use of the Photo with \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccopyright\\'s\\nvery purpose, \\xe2\\x80\\x98[t]o promote the Progress of Science\\nand useful Arts.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Campbell, 510 U.S. at 578, 114\\nS.Ct. 1164 (quoting U.S. CONST. art. I, \\xc2\\xa7 8, cl. 8).\\n\\n\\x0c7a\\nThis transformative use of the Photo is consistent\\nwith the remaining factors under Section 107 tipping\\nin favor of fair use. While the Photo is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccreative\\nwork of art,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that determination is of \\xe2\\x80\\x9climited\\nusefulness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d given that the Met is using the Photo \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor\\na transformative purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at\\n612. Similarly, the Met\\'s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccopying the entirety of [the\\nPhoto] [was] ... necessary to make a fair use of the\\nimage\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as one of many \\xe2\\x80\\x9chistorical artifacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\nexhibition. Id. at 613. Likewise, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransformative\\nmarket\\xe2\\x80\\x9d does not qualify as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional, reasonable,\\nor likely to be developed market,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 614 (quoting\\nAm. Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913,\\n930 (2d Cir. 1994)), and therefore Marano cannot\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprevent others from entering fair use markets\\nmerely \\xe2\\x80\\x98by developing or licensing a market for ...\\ntransformative uses of [his] own creative work,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d id.\\nat 615 (quoting Castle Rock Ent., Inc. v. Carol Pub.\\nGrp., Inc., 150 F.3d 132, 146 n.11 (2d Cir. 1998)).\\nThere is no indication in the record that the Met\\'s use\\nof the Photo on a web page describing the\\nFrankenstein guitar could, in any way, impair any\\nother market for commercial use of the Photo, or\\ndiminish its value. On balance, these factors indicate\\nthat the Met\\'s display of the Photo qualifies for the\\nfair use exception under Section 107.\\nMarano protests that this holding would extinguish\\ncopyright protections for photographers because\\nmuseums displaying copyrighted photographs will\\nalways be able to assert a fair use defense by\\nclaiming a scholarly, transformative purpose behind\\nthe exhibition. But it has long been established that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe determination of fair use is an open-ended and\\n\\n\\x0c8a\\ncontextsensitive inquiry.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blanch, 467 F.3d at 251.\\nHere, the district court appropriately conducted a\\nfair-use analysis that was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeeply case-specific,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a] different use by a museum or art exhibition\\nand combination of factors could have tipped the\\nscales in the other direction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Marano, 2020 WL\\n4735117, at *1. Such individualized analysis is\\nprecisely what Section 107 requires, and we discern\\nno error in the district court\\'s conclusion that the fair\\nuse exception applies to the Met\\'s display of the\\nPhoto.\\n***\\nWe have considered Marano\\'s remaining arguments\\nand find them to be without merit.

To determine whether a particular use\\nis fair use, courts engage in a case-by-case evaluation\\nusing four statutory factors in light of the purposes of\\ncopyright. Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at 608. The factors\\nto be considered include\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\n\\x0c23a\\n(1) the purpose and character of the use, including\\nwhether such use is of a commercial nature or is for\\nnonprofit educational purposes;\\n(2)\\n\\nthe\\n\\nnature\\n\\nof\\n\\nthe\\n\\ncopyrighted\\n\\nwork;\\n\\n(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used\\nin relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and\\n(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for\\nor value of the copyrighted work.\\n17 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 107.

For\\nthat reason, courts generally wait until the summary\\njudgement phase to address fair use, id. at 377, but\\ndismissal of a copyright infringement claim is\\nwarranted where fair use is clearly established on the\\nface of the complaint, TCA Television Corp. v.\\nMcCollum, 839 F.3d 168, 178 (2d Cir. 2016). In this\\ncase, Plaintiff does not object to addressing fair use at\\nthis stage of the proceedings. *83 7 Even if he did,\\ncases in which transformativeness can be determined\\nby doing a sideby-side comparison of the original work\\nand the secondary use are particularly appropriate for\\ndisposition on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. 8 Prince, 265 F.\\nSupp. 3d at 377 (describing transformativeness as\\nwhether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe allegedly offending use of the original\\n\\n\\x0c24a\\nwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d alters the first work \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith new expression,\\nmeaning, or message\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nA. Purpose and Character of the Use\\n[10] [11] The heart of the fair use inquiry is the\\npurpose and character of the use. Blanch v. Koons,\\n467 F.3d 244, 251 (2d Cir. 2006).

Time\\nWarner, Inc., No. 99-CV-1569, 2000 WL 358375, at *2\\n(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 6, 2000). To determine whether the\\nsecondary use is transformative, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquestion is\\nwhether the new work merely supersedes the objects\\nof the original creation, or instead adds something\\nnew, with a further purpose or different character,\\naltering the first with new expression, meaning, or\\nmessage.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at 608 (quotation\\nomitted); see Authors Guild v.

The defendant in that case\\npublished a coffee table book about the Grateful Dead\\nthat contained unlicensed images of concert *84\\nposters as part of a timeline of the band\\'s history. Id.\\nat 607. The timeline runs continuously throughout\\nthe book, chronologically combining approximately\\n2000 images representing the band\\'s history with\\nexplanatory text; among the images were seven\\ncopyrighted concert posters displayed in reduced form\\nwith captions describing the concerts that were\\nassociated with the posters. Id.\\nThe Second Circuit held that inclusion of these\\nposters for an historical purpose constituted fair use.\\nId. The Court first emphasized that the defendant\\'s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurpose in using the copyrighted images at issue in\\nits biography of the Grateful Dead is plainly different\\n\\n\\x0c26a\\nfrom the original purpose for which they were created,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbecause the posters \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfulfilled the dual purposes of\\nartistic expression and promotion,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whereas the\\ndefendant used the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimages as historical artifacts to\\ndocument and represent the actual occurrence of the\\nGrateful Dead concert events.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 609. The Court\\nnext considered how the images were used for\\nscholarship, noting that no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless a recognition of\\nbiographical value is warranted in this case simply\\nbecause the subject made a mark in pop culture\\nrather than some other area of human endeavor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nId. Finally, the Court found that the matter in which\\n\\nthe images were displayed in the book strengthened\\nthe transformative nature of the use. Id. at 611. The\\nbook reproduced the posters in a reduced size, in\\ncombination with textual material and graphical\\nartwork, and the posters represented an\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinconsequential portion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the book. Id.\\n[16] The Met\\'s use of the Photo is analogous on all\\nthree dimensions. First, Plaintiff and the Met used\\nthe Photo for entirely different purposes. Plaintiff\\nasserts that he created the Photo to show \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat Van\\nHalen looks like in Performance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\noriginal meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behind the Photo was to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconvey\\nthe message that Van Halen is a groundbreaking and\\nunorthodox musician.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pl.

In Bill Graham, the\\nSecond Circuit directly rejected the idea that the\\nsecondary use was required to comment on the\\nartistic value of the work when it found that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cenhancing [ ] biographical information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was a\\nsufficient transformative purpose. 448 F.3d at 610\\xe2\\x80\\x9311.\\nThird, the Photo constitutes an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinconsequential\\nportion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the Met\\'s online catalogue. Plaintiff\\'s\\nPhoto is a single image surrounded by pages of\\nnavigable textual, visual, and audio content.\\nSteinman Decl., Exs. B, C, and D. The Photo is located\\nseveral page-clicks within the actual catalogue of 185\\nobject pages. Steinman Decl., Ex. D. And even on the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guitar\\'s page\\xe2\\x80\\x94the primary focus of\\nwhich is historical and descriptive text and\\nphotographs of the guitar\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Photo is almost an\\nafterthought. Compl., Ex. B; Steinman Decl., Ex. E.\\nIn short, the online catalogue\\'s layout is designed to\\nenrich and elaborate the guitar\\'s historical\\nsignificance, primarily utilizing other photographs\\nand text to do so. See Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at 611\\n(finding further support for fair use where the\\ndefendant \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminimized the expressive value of the\\nreproduced images by combining them with a\\nprominent timeline, textual material, and original\\ngraphical artwork\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe images appear on\\nonly seven pages\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the 480-page book).\\n2. Commercial Nature\\n[17] In evaluating the purpose and character of the\\nuse, the Court must also consider \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether such use\\nis of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit\\n\\n\\x0c29a\\neducational purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 17 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 107(1). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\ncommercial/nonprofit dichotomy concerns the\\nunfairness that arises when a secondary user makes\\nunauthorized use of copyrighted material to capture\\nsignificant revenues as a direct consequence of\\ncopying the original work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Am. Geophysical Union v.\\nTexaco Inc., 60 F.3d 913, 922 (2d Cir. 1994). But\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbecause \\xe2\\x80\\x98nearly all\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fair uses of copyrighted works are\\nconducted for profit, the Second Circuit has cautioned\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x98the more transformative the new work, the less\\nwill be the significance\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the commercial sub-factor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPrince, 265 F. Supp. 3d at 382 (alteration omitted)\\n(quoting Cariou v. Prince, 714 F.3d 694, 708 (2d Cir.\\n2013)).\\n[18] Plaintiff argues that because the Met charges a\\ngeneral admission fee to out-of-town visitors to the\\nmuseum, it is a commercial enterprise and therefore\\nthe use at issue is commercial, notwithstanding the\\nMet\\'s status as a nonprofit organization. 10 Pl. SurReply at 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933; see Def. Reply *86 at 11. While discovery\\nmight be helpful in providing additional information\\nabout the Met\\'s revenue structure or how profitable\\nthis particular exhibition was, the relevant issue is\\nnot the Met\\'s business model but whether the use at\\nissue is commercial in nature. Even in the unlikely\\nevent that discovery would reveal that Plaintiff\\'s\\nPhoto drove viewers to visit the Met\\'s galleries and\\npay admission fees, the Court would not place much\\nsignificance on that fact due to the transformative\\nnature of the secondary use.\\nIn short, the first factor strongly favors a finding of\\nfair use.\\n\\n\\x0c30a\\nB. Nature of the Copyrighted Work\\n[19] The second fair use factor considers \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) whether\\nthe work is expressive or creative, ... with a greater\\nleeway being allowed to a claim of fair use where the\\nwork is factual or informational, and (2) whether the\\nwork is published or unpublished, with the scope for\\nfair use involving unpublished works being\\nconsiderably narrower.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cariou, 714 F.3d at 709\\xe2\\x80\\x9310\\n(quotation omitted).\\n[20] The Photo is indisputably creative and published.\\n\\nSee Monster Commc\\'ns, Inc. v. Turner Broad. Sys.,\\nInc., 935 F. Supp. 490, 494 (S.D.N.Y. 1996)\\n\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[P]hotographic images of actual people, places and\\nevents may be as creative and deserving of protection\\nas purely fanciful creations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). While ordinarily the\\ncreative nature of the Photo would weigh in favor of\\nthe copyright holder, the second factor has limited\\nweight in this analysis because the transformative\\npurpose of the Met\\'s use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas to emphasize the\\n[Photo\\'s] historical rather than creative value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill\\nGraham, 448 F.3d at 612\\xe2\\x80\\x9313; see Blanch, 467 F.3d at\\n257 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]he second factor may be of limited usefulness\\nwhere the creative work of art is being used for a\\ntransformative purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quotation omitted)); see\\n\\nalso\\n\\nAuthors Guild, 804 F.3d at 220 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe second factor\\nhas rarely played a significant role\\ndetermination of a fair use dispute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\nin\\n\\nthe\\n\\nThe second fair use factor weighs minimally, if at all,\\nagainst a finding of fair use.\\n\\n\\x0c31a\\nC. Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used\\n[21] [22] The third fair use factor asks whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nquantity and value of the materials used[ ] are\\nreasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nCampbell, 510 U.S. at 586, 114 S.Ct. 1164 (quotation\\nomitted). Although the Second Circuit has never\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cruled that the copying of an entire work favors fair\\nuse,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuch copying does not necessarily weigh against\\nfair use because copying the entirety of a work is\\nsometimes necessary to make a fair use of the image.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBill Graham, 448 F.3d at 613. Thus, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe third-factor\\ninquiry must take into account that \\xe2\\x80\\x98the extent of\\npermissible copying varies with the purpose and\\ncharacter of the use.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nId. (quoting Campbell, 510 U.S. at 586\\xe2\\x80\\x9387, 114 S.Ct.\\n1164).\\n\\n[23] While the Photo is displayed in its entirely, such\\n\\nuse is reasonable in light of the purpose and character\\nof the use. The Met uses the Photo as an historical\\nartifact providing visual context for the exhibition\\nobject and the accompanying factual information\\nabout the object. Compl., Ex. B; Steinman Decl., Ex.\\nE. In order to achieve this purpose, it is reasonable\\nthat the Met included the full picture of Van Halen\\nplaying the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guitar. Cf. *87 Kelly v.\\n\\nArriba Soft Corp., 336 F.3d 811, 821 (9th Cir. 2003)\\n\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf Arriba only copied part of the image, it would be\\nmore difficult to identify it, thereby reducing the\\nusefulness of the visual search engine.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Moreover,\\nthe Met reduced the size of the Photo and mixed it\\nwith text and other photographs, limiting the visual\\nimpact of the Photo\\'s artistic expression. See Bill\\n\\n\\x0c32a\\n\\nGraham, 448 F.3d at 613 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe conclude that such use\\n\\nby [the defendant] is tailored to further its\\ntransformative purpose because [defendant\\'s]\\nreduced size reproductions of [the plaintiff\\'s] images\\nin their entirety displayed the minimal image size\\nand quality necessary to ensure the reader\\'s\\nrecognition of the images as historical artifacts of\\nGrateful Dead concert events.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nIn this case, the secondary use was limited and\\nfocused on the historical nature of the Photo; the third\\nfactor thus does not weigh against a finding of fair use.\\nD. Effect of the Use Upon the Market for or Value of\\nthe Original\\n[24] [25] [26] The final fair use factor is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe effect of\\nthe use upon the potential market for or value of the\\ncopyrighted work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 17 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 107(4). This analysis\\nis concerned with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhether the secondary use usurps\\nthe market of the original work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blanch, 467 F.3d at\\n258 (emphasis added) (quotation omitted). It \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfocuses\\non whether the copy brings to the marketplace a\\ncompeting substitute for the original, or its derivative,\\nso as to deprive the rights holder of significant\\nrevenues because of the likelihood that potential\\npurchasers may opt to acquire the copy in preference\\nto the original.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Authors Guild, 804 F.3d at 223. As\\nwith the other factors, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis factor is also influenced\\nby the resolution of the transformativeness inquiry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbecause \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe more transformative the secondary use,\\nthe less likelihood that the secondary use substitutes\\nfor the original.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Prince, 265 F. Supp. 3d at 384\\n(quotation omitted).\\n\\n\\x0c33a\\nThe Second Circuit has made clear that a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransformative market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d does not qualify as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Bill Graham, 448 F.3d at\\n615 (holding that because the defendant\\'s use of the\\ncopyrighted images as historical artifacts \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfalls within\\na transformative market, [the plaintiff] does not\\nsuffer market harm due to the loss of license fees\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nAnd with respect to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional market,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a court\\nmust \\xe2\\x80\\x9clook at the impact on potential licensing\\nrevenues for traditional, reasonable, or likely to be\\ndeveloped markets,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not, simply, that the defendant\\nfailed to pay a licensing fee.\\n\\nId. at 614 (quotation omitted).\\n[27] [28] Plaintiff argues that museums are a\\npotential market for his work because they are\\nshifting towards more modern, pop-culture centered\\nexhibits. Pl. Sur-Reply at 6\\xe2\\x80\\x937. He requests discovery\\nto establish whether that market is \\xe2\\x80\\x9clikely to be [a]\\ndeveloped market.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 7. But Plaintiff \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot\\nprevent others from entering fair use markets merely\\nby developing or licensing a market [for]\\ntransformative uses of [his] own creative work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bill\\nGraham, 448 F.3d at 615 (quotation omitted). A\\ntraditional market for the Photo would be collectors of\\nphotographs of rock legends or other persons seeking\\nto showcase Van Halen. Being generous, that market\\nmight even extend to museums exhibiting musicians.\\nBut the Met\\'s use of the Photo to visualize the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guitar as played by Van Halen falls\\ninto a different, transformative market. It is thus\\nunlikely that markets for the Photo\\'s original\\nexpressive purpose would be affected in any way. In\\nany event, Plaintiff has offered only conclusory\\n\\n\\x0c34a\\nassertions that the Met\\'s use has caused \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca\\nmeaningful or significant effect upon the potential\\nmarket for the copyrighted work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Authors Guild, 804\\nF.3d at 224 (quotation omitted).\\n*88 Accordingly, the fourth fair use factor weighs in\\nfavor of a finding of fair use.\\nE. Balance of Factors\\nThe Court finds that the balance of the fair use factors\\nstrongly favors the Met\\'s use. The first and most\\nimportant factor weighs heavily towards a finding of\\nfair use and significantly colors the other three factors.\\nThe Met\\'s use of the Photo to present the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrankenstein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d guitar as an historical artifact is\\ntransformatively different from the original\\nexpressive purpose of the Photo. The second factor,\\nwhich might otherwise favor Plaintiff, therefore, has\\nlimited weight. Similarly, although Plaintiff\\'s Photo\\nwas copied in its entirety, the third factor does not\\nweigh against fair use because the amount of the\\nPhoto used is reasonable in light of the\\ntransformative purpose for which the Photo was used.\\nFinally, Plaintiff\\'s appeal to missed revenue in the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmuseums\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market holds no sway and, in fact, favors\\na fair use finding.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that\\nthe Met\\'s use of Plaintiff\\'s copyrighted Photo in its\\nonline catalogue is fair use. Accordingly, Plaintiff\\'s\\nComplaint is DISMISSED. The Clerk of Court is\\nrespectfully directed to close this case.\\n\\n\\x0c35a\\nSO ORDERED.\\nAll Citations\\n472 F.Supp.3d 76, 2020 Copr.L.Dec.

Case No. 13-6023\\nBankr. 09-46628\\n\\n3. The preclusive effect of a state court judgment in a subsequent federal lawsuit generally\\nis determined by the full faith and credit statute, which provides that state judicial\\nproceedings \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall have the same full faith and credit in every court within the United\\nStates... as they have by law or usage in the courts of such State... from which they are\\ntaken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n(73 S\\' . This statute directs a federal court to refer to the preclusion\\n\\nlaw of the State in which judgment was rendered. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has long been established that \\xc2\\xa7\\n1738 does not allow federal courts to employ their own rules of res judicata in\\n\\nrr\\n\\n\\x0cdetermining the effect of state judgments. Rather, it goes beyond the common law and\\ncommands a federal court to accept the rules chosen by the State from which die\\njudgment is taken.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Kremer v.

It does not matter if I quote die law and principals correctly,\\naccording to this court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions, my appeals are always dismissed or denied. I do not have to\\nmake this up. Look at the cases for yourself. That is just die federal cases. There ace state court\\ncases that are related to all the federal cases listed in the Questions Presented. (They will be\\nlisted in the Appendix)\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cWhen the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals denied or dismissed one of my cases I would\\nappeal to the U. S. Supreme Court. On the Supreme Court docket is four cases related to this\\nappeal. One is a Writ of Habeas Corpus. The writ of habeas corpus is one of what are called the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cextraordinary\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprerogative writs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which were historically issued by the\\nEnglish courts. The most common of the other such prerogative writs are quo warranto,\\nprohibito, mandamus, procedendo, and certiorari. I have filed a writ of mandamus and several\\nwrits of certiorari in this court. All pertaining to the racist scheme set forth back in 2009 in\\nMissouri civil court manifesting it way to the federal courts.\\nI would not have file a writ of habeas coipus not unless the situation was serious, and my\\nliberty was in jeopardy. (Danger of loss, harm, or failure)\\nThe U. S. Supreme Court dismissed my writ of habeas corpus as: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe motion for leave to\\nproceed in forma pauperis is denied, and the petition for a writ of habeas corpus is dismissed.\\nSee Rule 39.8.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See docket for 18-5400.\\nThe question presented in the writ was: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn re to Wilma Pennington-Thurman, can I file \"The\\nGreat Writ\" a Writ of Habeas Corpus when I am not physically incarcerated, but mentally\\nincarcerated by those in authority?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d This is a quote from the writ of habeas corpus:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen those in authority oppress you, they are putting a restraint on your Liberty while they are\\nclothed in the color of law and hide behind qualified immunity. When you are discriminated\\nagainst you are immediately consciously put in bindings as though you are convicted of being\\nwho you are. You feel captive held in custody of an improper violation of your Liberty. You do\\nnot feel free to pursue life as it should be. I We witness this. I have felt this. I feel like bricks\\nare on top of me. Discrimination is a heavy burden. It is thrown upon you like a bucket ofwater,\\ntossed at you, but the bucket is filled with dirty water that is hard to scrub off. You try to scrub it\\noff with Constitutional laws. Constitutional laws are supposed to wash this away, but the soap\\nbreaks in half and then into pieces. It is hard to get the dirt off. There you are scrubbing with\\nlittle pieces trying to get you liberty to shine again.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re Wilma Pennington-Thurman\\nThis does not define \\xe2\\x80\\x9cliberty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. So many of us feel like this every day.\\n8\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClassifications based solely upon race must be scrutinized with particular care, since they are\\ncontrary to our traditions and hence constitutionally suspect.

Quote from BOLLING et al v. SHARPE et al. 347 U.S. 497 74 S.Ct. 693\\n98 L.Ed. 884 (May 1954)\\nThis court said this 67 years ago. Why are we still having the same conversation in 2021?\\nHISTORY OF THIS CASE\\nWith that said, this brings me to the discussion about die present case that is related to all\\nprevious cases filed in this court. Same parties, same controversy. The property, my home.\\nAfter the writ of certioraris were denied in this court, I went over this controversy again. I\\nstarted with jurisdiction. 1 discovered that die bankruptcy judge and the state court judge did not\\nhave jurisdiction to render die judgments in this long lengthy case.\\nIn 2008, Bank of America, N. A. (BANA) foreclosed on my home with no notification. I filed\\na wrongful foreclosure case against BANA in die Twenty-Second judicial Circuit Court in\\nSt. Louis, Missouri. BANA settled the case, and the foreclosure was set aside and the complaint\\nfor damages was settled.\\nThe next year, BANA started foreclosure again. Claim preclusion should have prevented\\nBANA from proceeding again. It did not. Foreclosure was scheduled for July 9,2009.1 filed\\nanother wrongful foreclosure case in St. Louis Circuit Court (STL Court) July 13,2009, but\\nbefore 1 did that, 1 had filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in the U. S. Bankruptcy Court Eastern\\nDistrict of Missouri July 10,2009.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cThe summons were served on BANA in New York State and they had until August 31,2009\\nto answer the summons. BANA did not answer by August 31,2009.1 filed for a default\\njudgment and on September 14,2009, die STL Court awarded me with $150,000.\\nOn October 6,2009, the St. Louis Clerk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office filed my writ of execution against BANA at\\ntheir St. Louis branch on Market Street. The Sheriffs office served the writ on October 16,2009.\\nOn October 19,2009, BANA came storming into court filing motions. A motion to shorten\\ntime for a hearing, a motion to issue a stay on the writ of execution and a motion to set-aside the\\ndefault judgment. BANA told the court I was in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and I did not have the\\nright to file the Iawsuit(s), only the Trustee.\\nRight after I filed the writ of execution, I converted my chapter 13 to a chapter 7 bankruptcy.\\nThe Bankruptcy Trustee for my Chapter 13 had a motion to dismiss my chapter 13, because I had\\nnot made a payment. 1 could not work because I had been diagnosed with cancer and was on\\nchemotherapy. The judge granted by motion to convert to a chapter 7 on October 8,2009.1 did\\nnot want to file chapter 7, but I did not have too many options. I needed a place to live while I\\nwent through treatments.\\nThat day in court, October 19,2009, BANA got everything it asked for. I could not say a\\nword, because the judge had told me before the proceeding to sit there and not say a word. If you\\nlook at the docket for case 0922-CC08255 there are no entries where I made any comments. It\\nwas all BANA.\\nThe default judgment was filed September 14,2009, and BANA arrived in court on October\\n19*. The judge was out of time pursuant to Missouri Supreme Court Rule 75.01. The judge\\nretains jurisdiction for 30 days. He went beyond that and much more.\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cThe Appeals Court Eastern District recently stated in my State Court appeal (ED109198) that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cGenerally, atrial court loses control over its judgment thirty days after entry ofjudgment. See\\nRule 75.01. There are, however, exception to this rule. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupreme Court Rules 74.05,74.06, and\\n75.01 each provide procedural means by which to set aside judgments, each rule having its own\\nstandard for relief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cotleur v. Danziger, 870 S.W. 2d 234,236 (Mo.banc 1994) The granting of\\nthe motion to set aside the default judgment was accomplished under the authority of Rule\\n74.05(d), which extends the length of time for which the trial court has jurisdiction to set aside a\\ndefault judgment. Rule 74.05(d) provides that the party filing die motion to set aside shall do so\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin a reasonable time not to exceed one year after the entry of the default judgment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Rule\\n74.05(d); see Thompson v. St. John, 915 S.W. 2d 350, 357 (Mo. App. S.D. 1996) Quote taken\\nfrom Snelling v. Reliance Auto., Inc, 144 S.W. 3d 915,917 (Mo. App. E.D. 2004)\\nThis is the same state court case Petitioner Pennington-Thurman asked the bankruptcy court\\nto move to die adversary proceeding filed by me September 26,2019. (Present case on appeal to\\nthis court)\\nThe exception to the Mo. Sup. Ct. Rules does not cover the stay on the writ of execution. The\\nstay is governed by Missouri Revised Statute 513.365. (1939) The Statute states that after the\\nstay is issued \\xe2\\x80\\x9c.. .but all the property, real and personal bound by such execution or order of sale,\\nshall remain bound as if no such stay had been granted. Also, the Missouri Appeals Court\\noverlooked 11 U.S.C \\xc2\\xa7 362, the Automatic Stay. The STL Court disregarded the Automatic Stay\\nand proceeded with die default judgment. Missouri Supreme Court Rules do not make exceptions\\nfor federal bankruptcy laws. The trial court should not have proceeded with any judicial\\nproceedings.\\n\\nll\\n\\n\\x0cBANA sent a notice to the newly assigned Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustee and told him of the\\nhearing. He did not appear in state court. He never showed up for any ofthe State Court\\nhearings. Never filed an entry ofappearance.\\nPursuant 11 U.S.C. 362, the STL Court was to stop all court proceedings, They did not. The\\ndefault judgment was set-aside December 22,2009, and my discharge was January 27,2010.\\nSeell U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 362(cXl)\\nI prosecuted the wrongful foreclosure cases 0922-CC08255 and 0922-CC08256 against\\nBANA as a Debtor in Possession and received ajudgment on the merits. See 11 U.S.C 1303.\\nInstead of notifying the STL Court that all judicial proceedings were to stop and would move\\nthe default judgment to debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s estate, the Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Trustee decided to prosecute\\nthe cases again to appease BANA.\\nTrustee David A. Sosne negotiated a settlement with BANA whereas BANA paid my\\nbankruptcy estate $12,500 to have the 2009 State Court Cases dismissed with prejudice instead\\nof keeping the default judgment of $150,000.\\nMy creditor BANA and Trustee Sosne later filed in the STL Court a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJoint Motion to\\nDismiss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the 2009 State Court Cases with prejudice. During the bankruptcy hearing April 2010\\nto submit the proposed settlement to the bankruptcy court, I objected to the settlement\\nagreement. 1 was overruled and the settlement was approved and filed May 2010. See my\\nbankruptcy case docket 09-46628-399. See 28 U.S.C 157 (cXl)\\nThe question is, can the Bankruptcy Trustee disregard federal statute 11 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 362 (a)(1)(7) and \\xc2\\xa7 362 (cX 1X2) and perform his own res judicata?\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cIs the STL Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment to set aside the default judgment is void since it was issued\\nduring the automatic stay? Why didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t the Chapter 7 Trustee notify the STL Court that it was in\\nviolation of the automatic stay and keep the award of $150,000 in my bankruptcy estate for my\\ncreditors?\\nIn 2013, BANA starts hanging notices on my front door and sending notices in the mail. I filed\\na motion to reopen my bankruptcy case for violation ofthe automatic stay and the judge denied\\nthe motion. He said BANA was enforcing its in rem rights because BANA had a lien on the\\nproperty. I told the court I had a settlement agreement and BANA should not be hanging notices\\non my door and sending notices in the mail. Now, the settlement agreement did not mean\\nanything.\\nMissouri is a non-judicial foreclosure state, but there was a judicial foreclosure proceeding in\\nNovember 2008 and it ended with a settlement to set aside the wrongful foreclosure and dismiss\\nmy complaint for damages. There is also a settlement agreement filed in the U. S. Bankruptcy\\nCourt Eastern District of Missouri that is part of my estate.\\nBANA keeps claiming that I am barred by the doctrine of res judicata, but it appears BANA\\nis barred by the doctrine of res judicata.\\nIn 2016,1 filed another motion to reopen my bankruptcy case. This time the same Judge,\\nJudge Barry S. Schermer, denied my motion and redly made it seem like I had really done\\nsomething horrible by requesting to reopen my case for fraud upon the court. I discovered that\\ndie bankruptcy was not filed in my district. It was filed in Hannibal Missouri. Debts from a prior\\nbankruptcy filing in 2005 was added to my 2009 schedules. I also complained about the Trustee\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0ctaking $7,444 dollars of the settlement agreement which was for $12,500. The remaining $5,000\\nwent to my creditor the Internal Revenue Service and towards administrative fees.\\nIn 2019,1 filed an adversary proceeding to reopen my bankruptcy case pursuant to 11 U.S.C.\\n350 (b), 42 U.S.C.A. 1983; 11 U.S.C 105 for contempt, 11 U.S.C. 524 (aX 1X2) and Civil Rights\\nAct of 1964 with another motion to reopen my bankruptcy case. This time because I discovered\\nthat the bankruptcy judge did not have jurisdiction in 2010 to approve the settlement agreement.\\nPursuant to 28 U.S.C 157 (cXl X2) the judge violated this section. It reads;\\n(c)\\n(1)\\n\\nA bankruptcy judge may hear a proceeding that is not a core proceeding but that is otherwise\\nrelated to a case under title 11. In such proceeding, the bankruptcy judge shall submit proposed\\nfindings of fact and conclusions of law to the district court, and any final order or judgment shall\\nbe entered by die district judge after considering the bankruptcy judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposed findings and\\nconclusions and after reviewing de novo those matters to which any party has timely and\\nspecifically objected.\\n(2)\\n\\nNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, the district court, with the\\nconsent of all the parties to the proceeding, may refer a proceeding related to a case under title 11\\nto a bankruptcy judge to hear and determine and to enter appropriate orders and judgments,\\nsubject to review under section 158 of this title.\\nNo final order or judgment was entered by the district judge mid the judge did not have die\\nconsent of all parties to the proceeding. In the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJoint Motion To Dismiss\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, line 12, it reads: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nPlaintiff appeared at the hearing on the Trustee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion and objected to the approval of the\\nsettlement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Line 13 reads \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn May 17,2010, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving\\nthe settlement over the Plaintiffs objections. In the settlement agreement order, it states in the\\nfirst paragraph that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn objection was filed by Debtor, Wilma Pennington-Thurman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cThe Judge and Respondents were aware of my objection and 28 U.S.C 157 (c)(l)(2), but\\nproceeded on like it was all legal. There was no due process in that bankruptcy court for case No.\\n09-46628-399.\\nAlso filed with the adversary proceeding September 26,2019, was a motion to remove the\\nstate court proceeding filed against Petitioner Pennington-Thurman by Federal Home Loan\\nMortgage Corporation (FHLMC). Case No. 1822-CC0875-01. The bankruptcy court did not\\nremove the case and allowed two appeals to proceed at the same time. (State appeal ED109198)\\nAfter I filed the Motion for Rehearing in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, I discovered\\nthat Judge Schermer has been a friend and colleague of an Attorney that is an Attorney at the law\\nfirm that represents BANA in this case. They have known each other since 1989. Lloyd Patens is\\nSenior Counsel at Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP and is a well-known bankruptcy practitioner.\\nSee Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupplement to Motion for Rehearing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Exhibit A.\\n\\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT\\nWhen appeal is taken from a void judgment, die appellate court must declare the judgment\\nvoid. Because the appellate court may not address the merits, it must set aside the trial court\\'s\\njudgment and dismiss the appeal. A void judgment may be attacked at any time by a person\\nwhose rights are affected. Judgment is a void judgment if court that rendered judgment lacked\\njurisdiction ofdie subject matter, or of die parties, or acted in a manner inconsistent with due\\nprocess, Fed. Rules Civ.

A. in this case. Bank of America is represented by Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner\\nLLP. Judge Schermer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judicial remarks during the course ofthis case reveal an opinion that\\nderives from an extrajudicial source. His opinions over these past twelve years, reveal a high\\ndegree of favoritism as to make fair judgment impossible. See Liteky v. United States 510 U.S.\\n540 at 555 (1994); also see Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supplement to motion for rehearing filed\\nMarch 15,2021; 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 455(aXl)(2)\\nHere is a quote from Liteky v.

Health\\nServices Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847 (1988) but requiring them all to be evaluated on an\\nobjectitve basis, so that what matters is not the reality of bias or prejudice but its appearance.\\nQuite simply and quite universally, recusal was required whenever \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpartiality might\\nreasonably be questioned. \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540(1994)\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cJudge Schermer called my pursuit for the truth and justice \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrivolous and vexatious litigation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNow, when I discovered this, while working on this appeal, I presented this profound\\ninformation to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. If the Appellate court had read the\\nsupplement the outcome may have been different. Instead, the 8th Circuit Court issued an order\\nstating, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe petition for rehearing by the panel is denied.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d March 30,2021.\\nOn February 10,2021, the 8th Cir. Court filed a judgment that read \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis appeal from the\\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel was submitted on the record and briefs of the parties. After\\nconsideration, it is hereby ordered and adjudged that die judgment of die Bankruptcy Appellate\\nPanel in this cause is affirmed in accordance with the opinion of this Court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThis case was not submitted to the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel. It appears the Clerk of the\\ncourt is issuing judgments. The order issue Per Curiam ends with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe judgment is affirmed. See\\n8th Cir. R. 47B. The 8th Circuit Court has given me die same \\xe2\\x80\\x9c8th Cir. R 4?B for the past 7 years.\\nThis court stated in Caperton v. A. T. Massey Coal Co.:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Due Process Clause incorporated die common-law rule requiring recusal when a judge has\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca direct, personal, substantial, pecuniary interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a case, Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U. S. 510. 523,\\nbut this Court has also identified additional instances which, as an objective matter, require\\nrecusal where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe probability of actual bias on the part of the judge or decisionmaker is too high\\nto be constitutionally tolerable,4\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Withrow v. Lea-kin, 421 U. S. 35.47. Caperton v. A.T. Massey\\nCoal Co. 556 U.S. 868 (2009)\\nThere has not been any form ofdue process of die law in this case for twelve years just\\nbecause of this. Judge Schermer has great influence in the Eighth Circuit. He is on the\\nBankruptcy Appellate Panel. Die same panel that presided over my first appeal in 2013. He has\\nbeen relentless in keeping me from reopening my bankruptcy case. Now, I see why.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRelief is not discretionary matter, but is mandatory, Orner. V. Shalala, 30 F.3d 1307 (Cob.\\n1994).

I filed it pursuant to a\\nmotion for relief from judgment under Fed. R.Civ. P. 6Q(dX3) based on allegations of fraud,\\nfollowing a settlement in the bankruptcy court that was non-core and unlawful distribution of the\\nsettlement funds and bankruptcy procedures. Judge Schermer denied that motion and admitted he\\napproved the settlement agreement. Not the district court, he did. This is a settlement agreement\\nthat is void and has no validity, but Respondents want to use the judgment to establish a right to\\npast and present judicial proceedings in state and federal court.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf the releasing party fails to include provisions protecting the non-dischargeable character of\\nthe debt, the obligation may be transformed into a mere contractual obligation dischargeable in\\nbankruptcy. This would be true particularly if the settlement involves the entry of a judgment\\nconverting an unliquidated claim into a fixed debt obligation, without a clarification that the\\nclaim is subject to non-dischargeability.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See In re Cybersight LLC, No. 04-112,2004 U.S. Dist.\\nLEXIS 24426 (D.

We make clear that we are not required to decide whether in\\nfact Justice Embry was influenced, but only whether sitting on the case then before the Supreme\\nCourt of Alabama \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould offer a possible temptation to the average... judge to... lead him not\\nto hold the balance nice, clear and true.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Due Process Clause \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay sometimes bar trial by\\njudges who have no actual bias and who would do their very best to weigh the scales ofjustice\\nequally between the contending parties.

For the reasons set\\nforth below, Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Motion to Dismiss will be denied. The Bankruptcy Court\\nOrder Denying Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion to Reopen will be affirmed.\\nBackground\\nAppellee Bank of America has provided a detailed background:\\nMore than nine years ago, the trustee of Pennington-Thurman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bankruptcy\\nestate settled claims that she had asserted against Bank of America.\\nPennington-Thurman received a discharge of her personal liability on her\\nmortgage loan from Bank of America. Her bankruptcy case was closed in\\nlate 2011. Because the discharge did not affect the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lien on\\nPennington-Thurman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property, see In re Pennington-Thurman, 559 F.\\nApp\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 600 (8th Cir. 2014), the bank pursued foreclosure. In response,\\nPennington-Thurman began a litigation campaign that has continued for\\nyears after the property was sold to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage\\nCorporation (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFreddie Mac\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) at foreclosure in November 2014. In summary:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pennington-Thurman first requested the bankruptcy court to reopen the\\nbankruptcy case to permit her to sue Bank of America for allegedly violating\\nthe discharge injunction. The court denied this relief because such a claim\\nwould have no merit, and that decision was affirmed by two appellate courts.\\nSee In re Pennington-Thurman, 499 B.R. 329, 330 (B.A.P. 8th Cir. 2013),\\naffd, 559 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 600 (8th Cir. 2014). The Supreme Court of the United\\nStates denied Pennington-Thurman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition for certiorari and her petition\\nfor rehearing. See Pennington-Thurman v. Bank ofAmerica, N.A., 574 U.S.\\n1034 (2014), reh\\xe2\\x80\\x99g denied, 135 S. Ct. 1489 (2015).\\n2\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Pennington-Thurman sued the bank and others in state court in 2014 in an\\neffort to forestall foreclosure. The Missouri Court of Appeals dismissed an\\ninterlocutory appeal by Pennington-Thurman in Case No. ED 102300. After\\nthe circuit court entered a final judgment dismissing her claims, the court of\\nappeals affirmed in part and dismissed in part. Pennington-Thurman v. Bank\\nof America, N.A., 486 S.W.3d 471 (Mo. App. E.D. 2016).

First, there is an important interest in bankruptcy law to promote\\nfinality so court-approved reorganizations are able to go forward in reliance\\non an approval. In re Info. Dialogues, Inc., 662 F.2d at 477. Second, there is\\na competing interest in a party\\'s ability to secure review of a bankruptcy\\norder which adversely affects the party. Id. A reviewing court must carefully\\nbalance these two considerations. See In re Charter Commc\\'ns, Inc., 691\\nF.3d 476, 478 (2d Cir. 2012).\\nId. Further, Appellees urge the FishDish Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusion:\\nThis Court finds the policy of finality to be more important than the public\\npolicy of permitting an appeal in this case. Thus, this factor weighs in favor\\nof concluding the doctrine of equitable mootness applies.\\nId at *16-17. As the FishDish Court recognized, the doctrine of equitable\\nmootness sets out a detailed approach to dismissal of bankruptcy appeals in\\nsituations involving Chapter 13 reorganizations and the consummation of the plan\\nof reorganization. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe doctrine of equitable mootness applies in bankruptcy\\nproceedings to \\xe2\\x80\\x98promote an important policy of bankruptcy law that courtapproved reorganizations be able to go forward in reliance on such approval unless\\na stay has been obtained.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 In re Info.

The matter before the Court is an appeal from an Order in a Chapter 7\\nproceeding, and as such, Appellees have failed do demonstrate that the doctrine\\napplies.\\n7\\n\\nt\\n\\n\\x0cStanding to Appeal Bankruptcy Decision\\nAppellees further argue that appellant does not have standing to appeal the\\nBankruptcy Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision because Appellant no longer has an interest in the\\nproperty at issue. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStanding in a bankruptcy appeal is narrower than Article III\\nstanding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opportunity Fin., LLC v. Kelly, 822 F.3d 451, 458 (8th Cir. 2016)\\n(citation omitted). The Eighth Circuit has consistently \\xe2\\x80\\x9capplied a person aggrieved\\nstandard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to determine appellate standing in Bankruptcy cases. In re O & S\\nTrucking, Inc. v. Mercedes Benz Fin. Servs. USA, 811 F.3d 1020, 1023 (8th Cir.\\n2016). The narrower standing requirement reflects a need to limit collateral appeals\\nand advances the public policy interest of providing finality in bankruptcy\\nproceedings. See Opportunity Fin., LLC, 822 F.3d at 458; Spenlinhauer v.\\nO\\'Donnell, 261 F.3d 113, 118 n.4 (1st Cir. 2001).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn appellant is a party aggrieved if the bankruptcy court order diminishes\\nthe person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s property, increases the person\\'s burdens, or impairs the person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Opportunity Fin., LLC, 822 F.3d at 458. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUnder the person aggrieved\\ndoctrine, the appellant has the burden to demonstrate that the challenged order\\ndirectly and adversely affect[ed] his pecuniary interests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re O & S Trucking,\\nInc., 811 F.3d at 1023. Potential pecuniary harm that is several steps removed from\\nthe challenged order is not sufficient to satisfy the aggrieved person requirement.\\n8\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0cOpportunity Fin., LLC, 822 F.3d at 458. For standing to exist there must be a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdirect pecuniary impact.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nAppellant satisfies the standing requirement. Through moving to reopen\\nher bankruptcy proceeding, Appellant was attempting to argue that the divestiture\\nof her interest in the property was improper.\\nIssue on Appeal\\nThe issue presented for this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Appellate review is whether the\\nbankruptcy court abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third motion to reopen\\nher Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.\\nA decision denying a motion to reopen is reviewed for an abuse of\\ndiscretion.

(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBANA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Together with her Motion to Reopen, the\\nDebtor also filed a motion to remove state court proceedings to the bankruptcy court, a\\nmotion to change judges for the adversary proceeding, and an adversary complaint. I\\nafford no relief to the Debtor.\\n\\nBACKGROUND\\nThis is the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third attempt to reopen her 2009 bankruptcy case as part of\\nher ongoing and seemingly endless litigation related to her home mortgage, foreclosure,\\nand removal from the property.1\\nOn July 10, 2009, the Debtor filed a petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the\\nBankruptcy Code. She listed an ownership interest in her residence located at 8722\\nPartridge Ave., St. Louis, MO 63147 (Property). Three months later, the Debtor converted\\nher case to one under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. Shortly after filing her Chapter\\n13 petition, but before her case was converted to Chapter 7, the Debtor commenced two\\nlawsuits in Missouri state court (2009 Missouri Litigation), alleging fraud and wrongful\\nforeclosure against Bank of America, NA. (BANA) relating to alleged pre-petition actions\\nby BANA in connection with her home mortgage. The Missouri court entered a default\\njudgment, which was later set aside. In January 2010, the Debtor obtained a Chapter 7\\ndischarge. In April 2010,1 approved the Chapter 7 trustee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compromise and settlement\\nof the 2009 Missouri Litigation. In accordance with the settlement, the Missouri court\\ndismissed the 2009 Missouri Litigation with prejudice. The Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bankruptcy case was\\nfully administered and closed by final decree on December 29, 2011.\\n11 make my findings of facts from the judicial records of this and other courts.\\n\\nSLF 5\\n\\n\\x0cPg 2 Of 6\\n\\nStarting before the 2014 foreclosure sale of the Property to Freddie Mac, and\\nlasting well beyond it and into the present, the Debtor has engaged in an unsuccessful\\nlitigation campaign in state and federal courts (seeking relief even from the United States\\nSupreme Court and the Missouri Supreme Court) contesting every step of the process\\nfor the foreclosure of her mortgage, removal from the Property, and beyond. _ She sued\\ndozens of parties, including BANA, Freddie Mac, Millsap & Singer, judges, courts,\\nlawyers, law firms, the United States, and others., She attempted to change the forum for\\nproceedings and challenged decisions of courtson appeal and .through other efforts. ,For\\nexample, she sought to remove state court actions to federal court and to . reopen\\npreviously decided matters.\\nv.\\n,\\n\\n^\\n\\n*\\n\\ni.\\n\\nThe Debtor first sought to reopen her bankruptcy case in 2013 to file an adversary\\nproceeding against BANA for an alleged violation of the discharge injunction in connection\\nwith the foreclosure proceeding it commenced against the Property. I denied the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrequest. The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit\\nCourt of Appeals affirmed. The United States Supreme Court denied the Debtor\\'s petition\\nfor writ of certiorari and her petition for rehearing.\\nIn 2016, the Debtor filed her second motion to reopen her bankruptcy case. This\\ntime the Debtor sought to proceed against the Chapter 7 trustee and his professionals as\\nan\\'effort to defeat the settlement that I approved in 2010. I denied the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to\\nreopen.2 The Bankruptcy Appellate Panel for the Eighth Circuit dismissed her appeal of\\nmy ruling based on the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to pay the docketing fees for the appeal.\\nr* \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\n\\nThe Debtor\\'s third motion to reopen her bankruptcy case, now before me, appears\\nto have been triggered by a state court action concerning the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s efforts to place a\\nlien on the Property. In the spring of 2017, the Debtor prepared and recorded a Deed of\\nTrust naming herself as Borrower, Lender, and ^Trustee of the Property, purporting to\\nplace a lien in amount exceeding $80,000 on it. In response, Freddie Mac, with Millsap\\n& Singer LLC acting as its counsel, filed a document in state court titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cVerified Petition\\nto Strike Non-Consensual Lien Pursuant to RSMo. \\xc2\\xa7 428.120 and \\xc2\\xa7 428.135, and to Quiet\\nTitle\" (2019 Missouri Litigation). In August 2018, the Debtor filed a notice of removal of\\nthe 2019 Missouri Litigation to the federal district court. That court remanded the matter\\n\\n2 I also denied the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to waive the filing fee for her 2016 motion to reopen and required the\\nDebtor to pay the $260 filing fee to the Clerk of the Court.

And she complains about my denial of her\\n2016 request to reopen this case. It is evident that the Debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real goal is to relitigate a\\npanoply of issues upon which she has already received rulings: the 2019 Missouri\\nLitigation; the Chapter 7 trustee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s settlement with SANA; and all matters related to the\\nforeclosure of the mortgage on the Property and her removal from it.\\nReopening is not warranted here because no relief would be forthcoming to the\\nDebtor.

The district court entered summary judgment for the defendant, concluding that no\\nreasonable jury could find that USCIS\\'s employment decisions were discriminatory or\\nretaliatory. We affirm.\\nPresti joined USCIS in 2002 as an immigration officer. Over the next eleven years,\\nshe filed two complaints with the EEOC about discrimination on the job. In her first\\ncomplaint, in 2008, she stated that she had been passed over for a role because of her\\nItalian heritage. The EEOC made a finding of discrimination, and USCIS offered her the\\njob she sought. The second, in 2013, concerned feedback in her annual review. That\\ncomplaint was settled through mediation.\\nIn 2015, Presti\\'s supervisor gave her some more negative feedback in an\\notherwise positive annual performance review. He wrote that Presti came across as\\nconfrontational and demanding and needed to work on her communication, but he also\\nfavorably graded her overall score as 4.4 out of a possible 5 points, placing her in the\\ncategory of \"exceeding expectations.\" Presti objected to the comments about her\\ncommunication style, which she defended as \"open,\" \"direct,\" and rooted in her Italian\\nbackground and culture. Management edited the written feedback so that she and the\\nsupervisor approved of it.\\nAround this time, Presti applied for a promotion to Level III Immigration Officer.\\nApplicants were scored based on their interview performance and references, and the\\ntwo applicants with the highest scores were promoted. Presti\\'s total score was the fifth\\nhighest of the seven candidates.\\nPresti then filed a new EEOC complaint stating that she received negative\\nfeedback and was passed over for promotion based on her Italian descent. The EEOC\\nfound the charges unsupported.\\nIn March 2018, Presti applied to be a Supervisory Immigration Services Officer.\\nAt the time, she already was serving as a supervisor in a temporary capacity. She\\ninterviewed for the position, received the highest score in the selection process, and was\\noffered the job.\\nIn the meantime, Presti sued the Secretary of Homeland Security under Title VII\\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964,42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2000e-2, alleging that the two episodes from\\n\\n\\x0cCase:G\\xc2\\xa3fe4320-1397ocur\\xc2\\xa9eotjrfl@Piti3761094 Filed:Rinaf<S9\\xc2\\xa3E9E7Qe/2023lage^?^|es: 5\\n\\nNo. 20-1397\\n\\nPage 3\\n\\n2015\\xe2\\x80\\x94receiving negative feedback and being passed over for promotion\\xe2\\x80\\x94reflected\\ndiscrimination based on her national origin and retaliation for her earlier EEOC activity.\\nAfter she assumed the supervisory position, Presti\\'s performance declined. An\\nearly, first review garnered positive feedback, but complaints about her work followed.\\nPresti\\'s supervisor noted that Presti micromanaged her team\\'s work product and\\nstruggled to build relationships, and Presti\\'s coworkers complained about her treatment\\nof the team. At Presti\\'s mid-year review, her supervisor noted that her communication\\nstyle was overly direct and unpleasant, that she continued to micromanage her team\\'s\\nwork product, and that her lack of familiarity with the computer systems and relevant\\nlaw impeded her ability to assist her team and adjudicate cases. Even after this review,\\nPresti\\'s supervisor noted no change in her performance.\\nIn September, USCIS demoted Presti for poor performance. In a demotion letter,\\nher supervisor explained that Presti had failed to improve in her performance or to\\nmeet the job\\'s expectations, despite receiving mentorship and ongoing feedback.\\nPresti then amended her complaint to allege that the agency had demoted her in\\nretaliation for her earlier EEOC filings.\\nDuring the discovery that ensued, Presti twice filed motions to compel the\\nagency to produce documents she regarded as critical to her 2015 non-promotion claim.\\nShe first sought resumes and demographical data for positions to which she had not\\napplied between 2016 and 2018. After hearing argument from Presti on the motion, the\\nmagistrate judge presiding over discovery denied the request as irrelevant because\\nPresti was not challenging those selection decisions. Presti later sought the resumes of\\ncandidates whom USCIS had selected for promotion between 2014 and 2016, the same\\nperiod during which she was denied a promotion. The magistrate judge held another\\nhearing on the request before granting it in part, ordering USCIS to turn over the\\nresumes of candidates for any position to which Presti had applied.\\nThe district court ultimately entered summary judgment for USCIS. Based on the\\nevidence presented, the court explained, no reasonable jury could conclude that Presti\\nsuffered an adverse employment action in 2015 upon receiving negative feedback\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nfeedback that later was changed to her liking\\xe2\\x80\\x94or that any discriminatory or retaliatory\\nmotive influenced her non-promotion in 2015 or her demotion in 2018.\\n\\n\\x0c.\\n\\nCase\\n\\nNo. 20-1397\\n\\n320-1397ocu\\xc2\\xa9eDtjrf)\\xc2\\xa9fiti20,\\xe2\\x80\\x9961094 Filed: niiBtTCCOTBe^OHa\\'geff^es: 5\\n\\nPage 4\\n\\nOn appeal, Presti first challenges the district court\\'s denials of her motions to\\ncompel. In her view, she needed the requested resumes to identify possible comparators\\nto prove discrimination regarding the 2015 non-promotion.\\nThe district court acted within its discretion to deny both motions. When\\ndeciding motions to compel the production of personnel files, courts have \"broad\\ndiscretion to limit a request... in order to prevent the dissemination of personal or\\nconfidential information about employees.\" Brunker v. Schwan\\'s Home Serv., Inc.,\\n583 F.3d 1004,1010 (7th Cir. 2009). This discretion extends to limiting discovery over\\nsimilarly situated comparators in discrimination cases. See id.; Balderston v. Fairbanks\\nMorse Engine; 328 F.3d 309, 320 (7th Cir. 2003). Here, the district court properly found\\nirrelevant Presti\\'s first discovery request regarding selection decisions for jobs for which\\nshe had never applied. See Balderston, 328 F.3d at 320. Further, the court appropriately\\ndenied in part her request for resumes of successful candidates for promotion from 2014\\nto 2016 because she sought resumes of applicants for jobs different from the one to\\nwhich she had applied, and there is no evidence that selection decisions in those cases\\nwere made by the same decision-makers or using the same standards. See Brunker,\\n583 F.3d at 1010.\\nPresti next challenges the entry of summary judgment on her claims arising from\\nthe negative feedback she received on her 2015 annual review. We understand her to\\nargue that the district court did not view the record in a light favorable to her when it\\nconcluded that the negative feedback\\xe2\\x80\\x94which criticized her communication style and\\npostdated her EEOC complaints\\xe2\\x80\\x94was not discriminatory or retaliatory.\\nThis challenge is unpersuasive. To stave off summary judgment, Presti had to\\nproduce evidence to suggest that she suffered an adverse employment action because of\\nher national origin or in retaliation for her earlier, protected EEOC activity.\\nSee McDaniel v. Progress Rail Locomotive, Inc., 940 F.3d 360, 367, 370-71 (7th Cir. 2019).\\nBut, as the district court concluded, no reasonable juror could conclude that the\\nnegative feedback amounted to an adverse action (i.e., one that resulted in a significant\\nchange in an employment condition, such as income or career prospects, see Boss\\nv. Castro, 816 F.3d 910, 917 (7th Cir. 2016)). She received an overall score that \"exceeded\\nexpectations,\" the negative feedback was revised to meet her approval, and she offers\\nno evidence that the feedback affected her pay or job trajectory. And even if negative\\ncriticism on an otherwise strong evaluation could constitute an adverse employment\\naction, Presti offered no evidence that USCIS\\'s proffered rationale for the feedback\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\n\\x0cCase:CBife4320-1397ocuifieDtji13\\xc2\\xa7iffti3^1O94 Filed iRifefdQO^QO^O^agef^es: 5\\n\\nPage 5\\n\\nNo. 20-1397\\nthat her communication style was impeding her ability to work with others and\\nperform her job effectively\\xe2\\x80\\x94was pretextual. See id. at 916-18.\\n\\nPresti relatedly challenges the district court\\'s ruling that she lacked evidence\\nfrom which a jury could infer that she was demoted in 2018 in retaliation for her EEOC\\ncomplaints. She maintains that the court overlooked material evidence, namely the\\npositive feedback accompanying her early reviews in that job. But this argument misses\\nthe court\\'s broader point that her evidence was insufficient to persuade a reasonable\\njuror that protected activity was the but-for cause of her demotion. See Abrego v. Wilkie,\\n907 F.3d 1004,1014 (7th Cir. 2018). The undisputed record shows that USCIS demoted\\nher after several months of recorded poor performance, including struggles with\\nmanaging her team, building relationships, and accessing the systems necessary to do\\nthe job.\\nWe have considered Presti\\'s other arguments, and none has merit.\\nAFFIRMED\\n\\n\\x0cCase: 20-1397\\n\\nFiled: 01/28/2021\\n\\nDocument: 25\\n\\nPages: 1\\n\\nFor the Seventh Circuit\\nChicago, Illinois 60604\\nJanuary 28, 2021\\nBefore\\nJOEL M.

She also purports to make out a whistleblower claim and raises other\\nmiscellaneous grievances about the workplace. Defendant now moves for summary judgment on\\nall counts. For the reasons set forth below, Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment [72] is\\ngranted.\\nBACKGROUND\\nUnless otherwise indicated, the following facts are undisputed for purposes of this Motion.\\nPresti began her employment with USCIS in 2002 as an immigration information officer.\\n(Dkt. 74 ^ 1.) In 2004, she was selected for a term position as a district adjudications officer. (Id.;\\nDef. Ex. 3 at p. 14.) That term appointment expired in 2008, after which Presti was not selected\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document #: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 2 of 15 PagelD #:2259\\n\\nfor a permanent position. (Dkt. 74\\n\\n2.) Presti filed an EEO complaint in 2008, which resulted in\\n\\na finding by the EEOC that USCIS had discriminated against her. (Id.; PI. Ex. A-9.) Presti\\nsubsequently returned to USCIS in 2011 as a level-2 immigration services officer (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cISO-2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n(Dkt. 74 K 2; Def. Ex. 3 at p. 19.) In 2013, she filed a second EEO complaint, which was resolved\\nthrough mediation. (Dkt. 74 ^ 6.)\\nUSCIS has three levels of ISO positions, the most senior of which is an ISO-3. (Id. H 3.) In\\n2015, USCIS posted a vacancy for an ISO-3 position in USCIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chicago office, and Presti\\napplied. (Id.\\n\\n7.) The posted position was open to internal candidates only. (Id.) Applicants for\\n\\nthe position submitted resumes and responded to questionnaires in support of their applications.\\n(Id.) USCIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Human Resources Center in Burlington, Vermont conducted a preliminary review\\nof all the applications and then sent a list of nine eligible candidates to the Chicago office.\\n(Id.\\n\\n7, 13.) Presti was one of those nine candidates. (Id. H 13.) The Chicago office invited all\\n\\nnine eligible candidates to interview for the position, but only eight candidates chose to be\\ninterviewed. (Dkt. 85-1 at p. 60.) One of those eight candidates withdrew from consideration\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cshortly after the interview,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d leaving a total of seven candidates remaining for the position. (Id.)\\nUSCIS determined who to hire for this position by calculating a final score for each\\napplicant. (Dkt. 74 ^ 8.) The final score consisted of two components: interview performance\\n(55%) and references (45%). (Id.) The same three USCIS employees, Nick Milissis, Monica Toro,\\nand William Connor, interviewed each of the applicants. (Id. ^ 14.) At the time of the interview,\\nNick Milissis was aware of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prior EEO activity, but William Connor was not. (PI. Ex. B10\\nat pp. 185-86; P. Ex. 9 at pp. 179-180). No information in the record indicates whether Monica\\nToro was aware of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prior activity at the time of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interview. The panelists asked the\\nsame set of questions of all the applicants. (Id. f 16.) These panelists all received un-scrubbed\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document #: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 3 of 15 PagelD #:2260\\n\\nresumes from each of the applicants. {Id. If 15.) Each panelist scored each applicant on their\\nanswers to a list of pre-determined questions. {Id. ^ 16.) If the panelists\\xe2\\x80\\x99 scores were more than\\n15% apart for a given applicant, the panelists discussed their differences and adjusted scores based\\non consensus. {Id.) Presti received a score of 41.526 out of a possible 75.5 for the interview\\ncomponent of her application, placing her in fourth among the seven remaining applicants.\\n(Def. Ex. 9 at p. 204; Def. Ex. 5 at p. 169). i\\nAfter the interview portion of the applicant process was over, USCIS solicited two\\nreferences from the applicants. (Dkt. 74 If 9.) Because the ISO-3 position is a supervisory position,\\nUSCIS sought references from the applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 supervisors. {Id.) However, the hiring Standard\\nOperating Procedures (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSOP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) for this vacancy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwere not as clear as it [sic] could have been\\nregarding the need for both references to be individuals who had supervised the candidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Def. Ex. 4 at p. 161.) Four of the seven candidates, including Presti, did not provide two\\nsupervisory references. (Dkt. 7419.) Presti submitted one supervisory reference, Michelle Wong,\\nand one co-worker reference, Hearold Lacy. (PI. Resp. ^ 9.) Michelle Wong gave Presti a 10 out\\nof 20, noting that she thought Presti would benefit from more experience before becoming an ISO3. (Dkt. 74 ^ 10.)2 Because Lacy was not a supervisor, management instead contacted Stacy\\nSummers, one of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisors, to provide a second reference. {Id.\\n\\n11.) Summers gave\\n\\nPresti a 15 out of 20. {Id.)\\nOnce USCIS combined the reference and interview scores, Presti received a total combined\\nscore of 83.18. (Def. Ex. 5 at p. 171.) USCIS eventually selected two applicants for ISO-3\\n\\n1 Presti denies that her application ranked fourth following the interviews, but she provides no citation to the record\\nin support of this assertion. (PI. Add\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Facts f 2.) She states that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlaintiffs scores were lowered after the interview\\nwas conducted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 were increased (Id.), but she provides no citation to demonstrate the accuracy of this\\nstatement. The only evidence in the record is that she ranked fourth out of seven following the interview portion of\\nthe application.\\n2 Presti purports to deny the facts contained within this sentence, but she provides no citations to support her denial.\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions of fact, by contrast, are supported by citations to the record.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document#: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 4 of 15 PagelD #:2261\\n\\npositions, Thomas Powers and Shanita Tucker, whose scores were 102.68 and 91.85, respectively.\\n{Id.) Thomas Cioppa, the District Director of the Chicago office, then chose to hire both Powers\\nand Tucker for the open position on the basis that they received the highest scores in the application\\nprocess. (Def. Ex. 5 at pp. 171-72.) Cioppa was aware that Presti is of Italian heritage.\\n(PI. Ex. B1 at pp. 4-6.)3 Even if Presti had submitted a second supervisory reference of her\\nchoosing and received a 20 out of 20, her total score still would have been lower than both Tucker\\nand Powers. (Def. Ex. 9 at p. 205.)4 When asked who she would have submitted as her second\\nsupervisory reference if management had given her the opportunity, Presti testified that she did\\nnot know. (Def. Ex. 3 at p. 196.)\\nFor purposes of her claims related to her non-selection for the ISO-3 positions, Presti names\\nTucker and Powers as her comparators. (PI. Resp. ^[3.)5 Tucker is a woman of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrican and Latino\\norigin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with previous EEO activity. (PI. Ex. B15 at p. 223.) Tucker has worked in USCIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nChicago field office since 2008. {Id. at p. 222.) Powers is a Caucasian male. (Def. Ex. 5 at p. 171.)\\nIt appears that Powers had no previous EEO activity. (PI. Ex. B1 at p. 19.) Powers had extensive\\ntraining and experience in immigration-related jobs, including years of service with another federal\\nagency, experience with asylum adjudications, and service as a field intelligence officer. (Dkt. 74\\n^ 20; Def. Ex. 5 at p. 171-72.)\\n\\n3 Presti was bom in Italy. (Def. Ex. 5 at p. 169.)\\n4 Presti purports to deny the facts contained in this sentence but provides no citation to the record in support of her\\ndenial. She leaves the exhibit reference blank: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlaintiff denies that she would have been 5th in place if coworkers\\nhad provided 20 out of 20 points for references since she scored the highest off the list of eligible candidate [sic] (94),\\nand since manipulation of scoring occurred after the interview was complete. (Exhibit ).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (PI. Resp. | 12.) She\\nprovides no support for her assertion that her score was 94, not 83.18, nor does she provide support for the assertion\\nthat anyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s score was manipulated.\\n5 Presti has made various statements about who she is naming as her comparators. Most recently, she named both\\nTucker and Powers as her compactors. Because Presti is pro se, the Court affords her the benefit of the doubt and\\nassumes that she properly identified both Tucker and Powers as comparators.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document#: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 5 of 15 PagelD #:2262\\n\\nUSCIS gave Presti a Performance Plan Appraisal (PPA) every year during her time as an\\nISO.

In 2015, her first-line supervisor, Alejandra Dominguez, performed Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nPPA and gave her a 4.5 out of 5, a score indicating that Presti had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cachieved excellence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Dkt. 74 21.) In prior years, Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s scores were 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, and 4.6. {Id.) Although Presti\\nreceived an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cachieved excellence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rating, she objected to the narrative section of the PPA in which\\nPresti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supervisors noted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is recommended that ISO Presti continue to improve in applying\\nthe right tone to her email communications to management.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d {Id.\\n\\n22.)

Dominguez has\\nnever made any comments to Presti about her national heritage. (Def. Ex. 3 at p. 271.) Dominguez\\nalso noted that Presti was sometimes reluctant to assist co-workers with their assignments, and\\nDominguez asked Presti to be more receptive to assisting with the occasional reassignment.

III. Dept, ofHuman Servs., 697 F.3d 504 (7th Cir. 2012). To determine\\nwhether a plaintiff has a viable discrimination or retaliation claim, this Court asks whether all the\\nevidence, considered as a whole, would permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the\\nplaintiffs national origin or her earlier protected activity caused her adverse employment actions.\\nSee Ortiz v. Werner Enter., 834 F.3d 760, 765 (7th Cir. 2016). A plaintiff can make out aprima\\nfacie case for retaliation or discrimination by showing that (1) she is a member of a protected class,\\n(2) she performed her job to her employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimate expectations, (3) she suffered an adverse\\nemployment action, and (4) her employer treated similarly situated individuals who were not\\nmembers of her protected class more favorably. Coleman v. Donahoe, 667 F.3d 835, 845\\n(7th Cir. 2012). If a plaintiff successfully makes out a prima facie case of retaliation or national\\norigin discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, non-retaliatory reason for an adverse employment action. Id. If the defendant does\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document #: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 8 of 15 PagelD #:2265\\n\\nso, then the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s articulated reason is\\npretextual, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich in turn permits an inference of unlawful discrimination.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nTo prove a causal connection between a plaintiffs national origin and an adverse\\nemployment action under 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2000e-2(a), a plaintiff need only present evidence that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nmotive to discriminate was one of the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motives, even if the employer had other, lawful\\nmotives that were causative in the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Univ. of Tex.

By contrast, establishing a causal connection between an adverse\\nemployment action and retaliation under 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2000e-3(a) requires a plaintiff to show that\\nher \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 362.\\nAn adverse employment action is \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x9csome quantitative or qualitative change in the terms or\\nconditions of employment that is more than a mere subjective preference.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Madlock v.

A demotion is a quintessential type of adverse employment action.\\nSee, e.g., Hicks v. Forest Preserve Dist. of Cook Cty., 677 F.3d 781 (7th Cir. 2012). The failure to\\npromote is also an adverse employment action. Volovsek v. Wis. Dept, of Agr., Trade, and\\nConsumer Prot., 344 F.3d 680, 688 (7th Cir. 2003). A negative performance evaluation \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not\\nin itself constitute an adverse employment action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it may serve as evidence of discrimination\\nor evidence of pretext to suggest that the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s articulated reasons for some other adverse\\nemployment action are false.

Indeed, she received an\\noverall rating of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAchieved Excellence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sole objection to the PPA that Dominguez wrote\\nis about some language used in the narrative section. Presti admits, however, that management\\namended the narrative to her satisfaction after she noted her disagreement with it. To the extent\\nthat Presti attempts to make out a claim for national origin discrimination or retaliation based on\\nthe PPA, the Court grants Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment because there is no\\nremaining dispute between the parties as to the PPA. Even if such a dispute existed, a negative\\nperformance evaluation does not in itself constitute an adverse employment action. Moreover,\\nPresti provides no evidence that Dominguez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criticism of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s communication style was really\\npretext for animus against Italians.6 The Court, however, does consider the PPA as possible\\ncircumstantial evidence in support of Plaintiff s other national origin discrimination claims.\\nB.\\n\\n2015 Non-Selection for the ISO-3 Position\\n\\nPresti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-selection for the ISO-3 position was an adverse employment action. The only\\nquestion then about her non-selection for purposes of this Motion is whether, based on all the\\nevidence presented to the Court, a reasonable jury could conclude that USCIS did not select her\\nfor the position because of her Italian heritage or her earlier EEO activity.\\na.\\n\\nNational Origin Discrimination Claim\\n\\nIn support of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contention that USCIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision not to select her was motivated in\\npart by discrimination against her Italian heritage, Presti presents the following evidence. First,\\nseveral members of management, including the selecting officer, Thomas Cioppa, knew that she\\nwas of Italian origin because she had informed them of her heritage. Second, USCIS selected\\n\\n6 Indeed, Dominguez\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affidavit does not indicate that she knew Presti was from Italy. (PI. Ex. B14 at p. 211.)\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document#: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 10 of 15 PagelD #:2267\\n\\nindividuals of non-Italian origin, Tucker and Powers, for this position. Third, Presti received\\nconstructive feedback in a PPA regarding the tone of her email communications to management.\\nPresti believes, without citing any evidence, that management\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distaste for her communication\\nstyle contributed to her non-selection. Even supposing, arguendo, that USCIS did not select Presti\\nfor the promotion in part because of her communication style, Presti has failed to demonstrate why\\nthat is not a legitimate factor for the Agency to consider when making hiring decisions. The ISO3 position requires strong communication skills; some individuals making hiring decisions thought\\nhers could be improved. It was reasonable and lawful for them to consider this issue as part of their\\nevaluation of her.\\nEven if the Court assumes that Presti has made out a prima facie case of discrimination,\\nUSCIS has provided legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for hiring others instead of her;\\nnamely, that her reference and interview scores were lower than other qualified applicants.\\nMoreover, to the extent that her scores were lower because of the reviewers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 distaste for her\\ncommunication style, Presti has failed to demonstrate that the criticisms of her communication\\nskills were really a pretext for cultural animus or that such animus played any role in the selection\\nprocess. Even assuming that her scores were lower because the hiring SOP did not accurately\\ndescribe the need for two supervisory references, that mistake affected all applicants equally,\\nregardless of their ethnicity or other protected status. The Court therefore grants summary\\njudgment on the national origin discrimination count related to her non-selection for the ISO-3\\nposition.\\nb.\\n\\nRetaliation Claim\\n\\nIn support of her prima facie claim that retaliation was a but-for cause of her non-selection,\\nPresti has demonstrated that she is a member of a protected class (someone with EEO activity),\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document #: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 11 of 15 PagelD #:2268\\n\\nshe performed her job to her employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expectation, as evidenced by her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cachieved excellence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nreview, she suffered the adverse employment action of non-selection, and it appears that one of\\nher comparators, Thomas Powers, had no previous EEO activity. She has therefore made out a\\nprima facie case.\\nAlthough Presti adequately makes out a prima facie case, Defendant has articulated\\nlegitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for choosing others for the ISO-3 position. Presti only presents\\ntwo .pieces of evidence supported by citations to the record tending to support an inference of\\nretaliation. First, she has filed EEO complaints against USCIS in that past. Second, USCIS\\nemployees with influence over her hiring were aware of her prior EEO activity.7 Other evidence\\nin the record points to non-retaliatory reasons for Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-selection. For one, her combined\\ninterview and references score placed her well below the highest scoring candidates, both of whom\\nwere deemed eligible for the position by the Human Resources office in Vermont. Of course, Presti\\ncomplains that USCIS did not make her aware that she needed to provide two supervisory\\nreferences, which she claims negatively impacted her reference score. USCIS may have failed to\\ncommunicate the need for supervisory references only, but there is no indication that Presti alone\\nwas the recipient of this poor communication; all candidates had access to the same hiring SOP\\nregardless of their prior EEO activity. Even if she had the opportunity to provide another\\nsupervisory reference and even if that person had given her a perfect score, her total score still\\nwould have fallen below the other candidates because of her lower interview score. Presti infers\\nthat Nick Milissis\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge of her prior EEO activity must have biased him against her in the\\ninterview, but this is nothing but pure speculation. Indeed, Milissis signed an affidavit indicating\\n\\n7 Presti also repeatedly alleges that someone at USCIS manipulated her application scores downward while others had\\ntheir scores raised. She provides no evidence for this assertion, so the Court does not consider that allegation for\\npurposes of this motion.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document#: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 12 of 15 PagelD #:2269\\n\\nthat he thought Presti had a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood interview.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (PI. Ex. BIO at p. 188.) Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speculation, without\\nmore, is insufficient for this claim to survive the instant Motion. Based on the evidence before the\\nCourt, no reasonable jury could conclude that a retaliatory motive was a but-for cause of USCIS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision not to select Presti for the ISO-3 position.\\nThe Court therefore grants Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion with respect to the retaliation claim related\\nto Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-selection for the ISO-3 position.\\nC.\\n\\n2018 Demotion\\n\\nPresti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demotion from her position as SISO was another adverse employment action. The\\nonly question about that demotion for purposes of this Motion then is whether, based on all the\\nevidence presented to the Court, a reasonable jury could conclude that USCIS demoted her because\\nof her Italian heritage or her earlier EEO activity.\\na.\\n\\nNational Origin Discrimination\\n\\nIt is not clear whether Presti brings a national origin discrimination claim based on her\\ndemotion, but to the extent she does, her primary evidence is the same evidence she presents in\\nsupport of her national origin claim for the 2015 non-selection; namely, she once received\\nconstructive feedback regarding her communication style. This is insufficient evidence for a\\nreasonable jury to conclude that her demotion was motivated in part by discrimination against her\\non the basis of her Italian heritage.\\nb.\\n\\nRetaliation\\n\\nPresti is unable to make out a prima facie case of retaliation for her demotion because she\\ndoes not point to any similarly situated individuals who had no prior protected activity and retained\\na supervisory position. Assuming, however, that she has made out a primafacie claim, USCIS still\\nhad legitimate, non-retaliatory reasons for demoting her. Woodson documented a variety of\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document#: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 13 of 15 PagelD #:2270\\n\\nshortcomings in Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance as SISO, including her mismanagement of mandamus cases\\nand her failure to timely address Congressional inquiries. Woodson also thought that Presti\\nexcessively micromanaged and needed to improve her relationships with her subordinates. Presti\\neven admits that she had trouble managing the workload. Additionally, prior to being demoted in\\n2018, but after filing three EEO complaints in 2008, 2013, and 2015, USCIS promoted her to the\\nposition of SISO. The intervening act of promoting her tends to suggest that her demotion was not\\nretaliatory in nature. The years-long gap between her most recent EEO complaint and her demotion\\nalso attenuates an inference of causation. On this record, no reasonable jury could conclude that\\nretaliation against her EEO activity was a but-for cause of Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demotion. The Court therefore\\ngrants Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion for Summary Judgment on all claims related to Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 demotion.\\nII.\\n\\nWhistleblower Claim\\n\\nPlaintiff brings a whistleblower retaliation claim under 5 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2302(b)(8), stemming\\nfrom four purported whistleblowing actions8 she has taken over the course of her career at USCIS.\\nUnlawful retaliation claims under the Whistleblower Protection Act must first be filed with the\\nOffice of Special Counsel.

It appears\\nthat by listing these grievances, Presti is attempting to raise additional claims. She is not permitted\\nto do so at this stage of the litigation, so the Court does not and cannot consider these additional\\nclaims. See Clancy v. Office of Foreign Assets Control ofU.S. Dept of Treasury, 559 F.3d 595,\\n606-07 (7th Cir. 2009) (holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion by rejecting a\\nclaim because the plaintiff raised it for the first time in response to a motion for summary\\njudgment).\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cCase: l:18-cv-01710 Document #: 101 Filed: 02/20/20 Page 15 of 15 PagelD #:2272\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nPresti has failed to meet her burden to establish that a reasonable jury could conclude that\\nnational origin discrimination or retaliation against her protected activity caused her non-selection\\nfor the ISO-3 position or her demotion. There is no genuine issue of material fact, and Defendant\\nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law on these claims. The Court also lacks jurisdiction over\\nPresti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s whistleblowers claims, and Presti\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other miscellaneous grievances are not properly before\\nthe Court at this stage of the litigation. The Court therefore grants Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion for\\nSummary Judgment. [72]\\n\\n* \\xc2\\xbb\\n\\n4\\n\\n.

The Federal Election Commission filed a notice of appeal on June 13,\\n2021 (App., infra, 1a-2a). The jurisdiction of this Court\\nis invoked under the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\\nof 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-155, \\xc2\\xa7 403(a)(3), 116 Stat. 113114.\\n\\n(1)\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED\\n\\nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced at\\nApp., infra, 65a-68a.\\nSTATEMENT\\n\\n1. The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971\\n(FECA), Pub. L. No. 92-225, 86 Stat. 3, as amended by\\nthe Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA),\\nPub. L. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81, regulates the financing of federal election campaigns. The Federal Election\\nCommission (FEC or Commission) is responsible for\\nadministering those statutes. 52 U.S.C. 30106.\\nUnder FECA, BCRA, the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations, and\\nthis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s First Amendment precedents, candidates\\nmay use a variety of means to fund their campaigns. A\\ncandidate may spend an unlimited amount of his own\\nmoney in support of his election. Buckley v. Valeo, 424\\nU.S. 1, 52-53 (1976) (per curiam). The campaign may\\nalso accept contributions from individuals and certain\\npolitical committees, subject to per-election limits.\\n52 U.S.C. 30116(a) and (c). And the campaign may borrow money, either from a third-party lender or from the\\ncandidate himself. App., infra, 7a.\\nAs relevant here, federal law imposes three restrictions on the repayment of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal\\nloans. App., infra, 8a. First, BCRA states that a candidate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshall not\\xe2\\x80\\x9d use \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontributions made * * * after the\\ndate of [the] election\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to repay such \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal loans\\n* * * to the extent such loans exceed $250,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n52 U.S.C. 30116( j). Second, the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations provide that candidate committees may use preelection contributions to repay the portion of the loans\\nthat exceeds $250,000 only if the repayment is made\\nwithin 20 days after the election. 11 C.F.R. 116.11(b)(1)\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nand (c)(1). Third, if a candidate loan that exceeds\\n$250,000 remains unpaid 20 days after the election, the\\ncommittee must recharacterize the portion in excess of\\n$250,000 as a contribution rather than a loan (precluding later repayment). 11 C.F.R. 116.11(c)(2).\\n2. In 2018, appellee Senator Ted Cruz ran for reelection to represent Texas in the United States Senate.\\nApp., infra, 8a. Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign against Beto\\nO\\xe2\\x80\\x99Rourke was at the time the most expensive in the Senate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s history. FEC Statement of Undisputed Material\\nFacts (SMF), D. Ct. Doc. 65, \\xc2\\xb6 52 (July 14, 2020). Appellee Ted Cruz for Senate, Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s principal\\ncampaign committee, raised more than $35 million in\\n2017-2018. Id. \\xc2\\xb6 53.\\nThe day before the general election, Senator Cruz\\nlent his committee $260,000\\xe2\\x80\\x94$10,000 more than the\\nmaximum amount that BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment provision allows to be repaid with post-election contributions. App., infra, 8a. After the election, the committee\\nhad approximately $2.2 million in cash on hand. Ibid.\\nThe committee could have used those pre-election funds\\nto repay Senator Cruz in whole or in part, but it chose\\nnot to do so within the 20-day deadline set by FEC regulations. Id. at 8a-9a. If the committee had used preelection contributions to repay Senator Cruz $10,000\\nwithin that 20-day window, it could lawfully have used\\npost-election funds to repay the remaining $250,000.\\nOnce the 20-day deadline elapsed, the FEC regulation required that $10,000 of the prior $260,000 loan be\\nrecharacterized as a contribution from Senator Cruz to\\nhis campaign. 11 C.F.R. 116.11(c)(2). Senator Cruz\\nthen emailed his campaign staff : \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince more than 20\\ndays have passed, it would be REALLY good if we could\\npay back at least some of the $250k now.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMF \\xc2\\xb6 62\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n(citation omitted). The committee then repaid Senator\\nCruz $250,000. App., infra, 9a. But because the committee had purposefully waited until 20 days had\\nelapsed, it could not repay the remaining $10,000. Ibid.;\\nsee 11 C.F.R. 116.11(c)(2). Appellees have stipulated\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sole and exclusive motivation behind Senator\\nCruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99 actions in making the 2018 loan and the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions in waiting to repay them was to establish\\nthe factual basis for this challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMF \\xc2\\xb6 56.\\n3. On April 1, 2019, appellees sued the Commission\\nin federal district court in the District of Columbia, alleging that BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit violates the\\nFirst Amendment (and raising additional challenges to\\nthe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations). Compl. 1; App., infra, 9a; see\\nCompl. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 34-51. They invoked Section 403(a) of BCRA,\\nwhich authorizes a three-judge district court to hear\\nchallenges to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe constitutionality of any provision of\\nthis Act or any amendment made by this Act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BCRA\\n\\xc2\\xa7 403(a), 116 Stat. 113.\\nWhen a plaintiff files suit and requests that the case\\nbe heard by a three-judge district court, a single judge\\nmay dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction without convening a three-judge court. See Shapiro v.\\nMcManus, 577 U.S. 39, 45 (2015); Gonzalez v. Automatic Employees Credit Union, 419 U.S. 90, 96 n.14\\n(1974). Invoking that principle, the FEC moved to dismiss the claims before a three-judge court had been\\nconvened, arguing that appellees lacked standing to\\nsue. App., infra, 9a. Acting through a single judge, the\\ndistrict court denied the motion to dismiss and granted\\nthe application to convene a three-judge court. Id. at\\n40a-64a.\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nThe district court concluded that Senator Cruz had\\nstanding to sue because he had suffered a \\xe2\\x80\\x9c$10,000 financial injury\\xe2\\x80\\x9d due to BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit.\\nApp., infra, 51a. Citing appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaint, the district court stated that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[f ]ollowing the 20-day repayment period, the Cruz Committee repaid Senator Cruz\\nthe $250,000 statutory maximum using post-election\\ncontributions, but BCRA foreclosed it from paying back\\nthe $10,000 balance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 44a. The court observed\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenator Cruz loaned his campaign $10,000 more\\nthan he could legally be repaid using post-election contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; that the 20-deadline for using pre-election\\ncontributions to repay Senator Cruz had expired; and\\nthat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]s a consequence of all this, Senator Cruz is still\\nowed $10,000, * * * which is plainly a cognizable injury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid. The FEC argued that, because the committee could easily have used pre-election contributions\\nto repay all or part of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan during the 20day post-election window, Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury was\\nself-inflicted. Id. at 52a, 53a-54a. The court rejected\\nthat contention, stating that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he flaw in the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument [wa]s that it would require Senator Cruz to\\navoid an injury by subjecting himself to the very framework he alleges is unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 54a.\\nThe FEC took steps to renew its standing argument\\nduring discovery. See 451 F. Supp. 3d 92, 97-98. But\\nthe three-judge court \\xe2\\x80\\x9creject[ed]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9coutright.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 98. The court noted that the single\\njudge had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplained, in detail, why [the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] theory\\nthat [appellees] had caused their own injury * * * is\\nirrelevant to standing,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadopt[ed] that analysis\\nin its entirety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid.\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n4. The three-judge district court subsequently\\ngranted appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 motion for summary judgment, denied the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for summary judgment, and held\\nthat BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit violates the First\\nAmendment. App., infra, 5a-37a. In its description of\\nthe factual background of the suit, the three-judge court\\nstated (consistent with appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaint and the\\nprior opinion of the single-judge court) that the campaign committee had \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepaid Senator Cruz the maximum $250,000 with post-election contributions but\\n[BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit] prevented the campaign from paying back the final $10,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 9a.\\nThe district court first concluded that the loanrepayment limit burdens the exercise of political\\nspeech. App., infra, 11a-19a. The court explained that\\nthe limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburdens candidates who wish to make * * *\\npersonal loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to their campaigns by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstrain[ing]\\nthe repayment options available to the candidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 13a-14a. The court suggested that, as a result of the\\nlimit, a candidate could be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinhibited from making a personal loan * * * out of concern that she will be left holding the bag on any unpaid campaign debt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 19a.\\nApplying heightened scrutiny, the district court then\\nconcluded that the government had not adequately justified this burden on political speech. App., infra, 20a36a. The court acknowledged that, under this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprecedents, Congress may enact campaign-finance laws\\nto prevent the reality and appearance of quid pro quo\\ncorruption. Id. at 21a. The court concluded, however,\\nthat the FEC had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfail[ed] to demonstrate that quid pro\\nquo corruption or its appearance arises from post-election\\ncontributions to retire a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal debt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 23a. The court noted that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe FEC ha[d] not identified a single case of actual quid pro quo corruption in\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nthis context,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmany states impose no restriction on using post-election contributions to repay\\ncandidate loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid.\\nThe district court further held that the loanrepayment limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[wa]s not \\xe2\\x80\\x98closely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to protect expressive and associational freedoms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 30a\\n(citation omitted). The court deemed the limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cover inclusive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it \\xe2\\x80\\x9capplies across the board to winning\\nand losing candidates, although any purported anticorruption rationale applies only to winning candidates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 31a. The court also found the limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstantially\\nunderinclusive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a] person may contribute to\\nretire any outstanding campaign debt, with the exception of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans over $250,000.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 32a. Finally, the court emphasized that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he loanrepayment limit also imposes an additional regulatory\\nrequirement on top of the existing base [contribution]\\nlimits,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which already protect \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagainst quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 34a.\\nREASONS FOR SUMMARY VACATUR OR\\nFOR POSTPONING JURISDICTION\\n\\nUnder Section 403(a) of BCRA, a suit challenging\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe constitutionality of any provision of this Act or any\\namendment made by this Act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d may be filed in the\\nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia and heard by a three-judge court. \\xc2\\xa7 403(a)(1), 116\\nStat. 113-114. A separate provision makes Section\\n403(a) applicable to suits filed after 2006 if the plaintiffs\\nso elect, see \\xc2\\xa7 403(d)(2), 116 Stat. 114, and appellees so\\nelected here, see App., infra, 9a, 43a. Section 403(a)\\nfurther provides that, when a plaintiff challenging the\\nconstitutionality of a BCRA provision invokes that special review mechanism, the three-judge district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinal decision in the action shall be reviewable only by\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nappeal directly to the Supreme Court of the United\\nStates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xa7 403(a)(3), 116 Stat. 114. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuch appeal shall\\nbe taken by the filing of a notice of appeal within 10\\ndays, and the filing of a jurisdictional statement within\\n30 days, of the entry of the final decision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid. Section\\n403(a) makes it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe duty\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the district court and this\\nCourt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto advance on the docket and to expedite to the\\ngreatest possible extent the disposition of the action\\nand appeal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xa7 403(a)(4), 116 Stat. 114.\\nIn a direct appeal, this Court has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno discretion to\\nrefuse adjudication of the case on its merits as would\\nhave been true had the case been brought here under\\n[its] certiorari jurisdiction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Hicks v. Miranda, 422\\nU.S. 332, 344 (1975). The Court may address the merits\\neither by granting plenary consideration or by summarily disposing of the appeal. Ibid. Here, the district\\ncourt erred both by holding that appellees have standing to challenge BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit, and by\\nholding that the limit violates the First Amendment.\\nThis Court should summarily vacate the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision and remand the case for further consideration\\nof standing in light of its intervening decision in California v. Texas, No. 19-840 (June 17, 2021). Otherwise,\\nthe Court should set the case for plenary consideration.\\n1. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must\\nshow that it suffered an injury-in-fact; that its injury\\nwas fairly traceable to the defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenged conduct; and that a favorable judicial decision would redress the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury. See Lujan v. Defenders of\\nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992). The standing issue in this case turns on the second of those requirements, traceability.\\nIn this case, the district court held that Senator Cruz\\nhad standing to challenge BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nbecause the committee still owed him $10,000 but could\\nnot repay that sum. App., infra, 51a. That was error.\\nAlthough the loss of $10,000 constituted injury, that injury was not fairly traceable to the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enforcement\\nof the loan-repayment limit. That is so for two separate\\nreasons: (1) that injury was not traceable to the enforcement of the specific statutory provision that the\\ndistrict court held unconstitutional, and (2) the injury\\nwas self-inflicted.\\na. In California, this Court explained that, in order\\nto establish standing, a plaintiff must show that its injury is \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98fairly traceable\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to enforcement of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98allegedly unlawful\\xe2\\x80\\x99 provision of which the plaintiffs complain.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Slip op. 15 (emphasis added; citation omitted).\\nA plaintiff does not have standing to challenge a given\\nprovision if its injury is attributable to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother provisions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of law. Id. at 14. In this case, the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninability to repay Senator Cruz is not attributable to\\nBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit.\\ni. The loan-repayment limit prohibits a committee\\nfrom using more than $250,000 in post-election funds to\\nrepay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans. See 52 U.S.C.\\n30116( j). When the single-judge district court denied\\nthe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to dismiss and granted appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 request for a three-judge court, it appropriately took as\\ntrue the allegations in appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaint. Because\\nappellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaint alleged that the committee had\\nused post-election funds to repay Senator Cruz\\n$250,000, the court decided the standing issue based on\\nthat understanding. See App., infra, 44a; Compl. \\xc2\\xb6 31\\n(alleging that the committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cha[d] repaid the statutory\\nmaximum of $250,000 from money raised after the election\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). If that factual understanding were correct,\\nBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit would indeed prevent the\\n\\n\\x0c10\\ncommittee from using additional post-election funds to\\nrepay the remaining $10,000.\\nDuring discovery, the FEC took steps to renew its\\nargument that appellees lacked standing. But in ruling\\non a discovery dispute, the three-judge court \\xe2\\x80\\x9creject[ed] outright [the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] argument\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nadopted the single judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s analysis of standing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin its\\nentirety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 451 F. Supp. 3d 92, 98.\\nii. In its subsequent merits ruling, the three-judge\\ndistrict court similarly stated that the committee had\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9crepaid Senator Cruz the maximum $250,000 with postelection contributions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 9a. That statement, however, was contrary to the summary-judgment\\nrecord that had been developed since the single-judge\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling on the motion to dismiss. That record\\nmade clear that the committee had not yet used any\\npost-election funds to repay Senator Cruz, but instead\\nhad repaid Senator Cruz $250,000 using only preelection funds.\\nIn particular, that record contained deposition testimony confirming that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he committee did not receive\\nany post-election contributions at any time after * * *\\nthe general election of 2018.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 65-9, at 95\\n(May 13, 2020). The deponent explained that, although\\nthe committee had continued to receive contributions\\nafter election day 2018, it had designated those contributions for use in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe primary and the general 2024\\nelection cycle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that none of those funds were\\ntreated as contributions to Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 campaign. Id. at 96. Further, appellees expressly admitted\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]one of the $250,000 of the loan that was repaid\\nwas from contributions raised after the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct.\\nDoc. 67-1 \\xc2\\xb6 64; see id. \\xc2\\xb6 60 (admitting that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cduring the\\n\\n\\x0c11\\n20 days after the election and later, the Committee continued receiving post-election contributions, but rather\\nthan using those contributions to pay vendors or to pay\\nany of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt, the campaign designated\\nthe contributions for Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2024 re-election effort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThus, by the time the three-judge district court ruled\\non the merits of appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 First Amendment challenge\\nto BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit, the record made clear\\nthat appellees had used pre- rather than post-election\\ncontributions to repay Senator Cruz $250,000. At that\\npoint, any continued reliance on the contrary allegation\\nin appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 complaint was unwarranted. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[E]ach element [of standing] must be supported in the same way\\nas any other matter on which the plaintiff bears the burden of proof, i.e., with the manner and degree of evidence required at the successive stages of the litigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. at 561. At the\\nsummary-judgment stage, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe plaintiff can no longer\\nrest on * * * \\xe2\\x80\\x98mere allegations,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 but must \\xe2\\x80\\x98set forth\\xe2\\x80\\x99 by\\naffidavit or other evidence \\xe2\\x80\\x98specific facts.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid. (citation omitted). Appellees did not submit any evidence\\nsuggesting that the committee had used post-election\\ncontributions to repay $250,000 of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan.\\nAnd even if they had, the contrary evidence discussed\\nabove would have raised a genuine dispute of material\\nfact that the court could not have resolved at summary\\njudgment. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).\\niii. Because the prior $250,000 repayment to Senator\\nCruz was made using pre-election funds, nothing in\\nBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment provision stops the committee\\nfrom raising post-election contributions and using those\\ncontributions to repay the remaining $10,000 owed to\\nSenator Cruz. To the extent that appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injury is\\n\\n\\x0c12\\nattributable to the FEC at all, it flows from the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nenforcement of an agency regulation, not from its enforcement of the statutory loan-repayment limit. Once\\nthe committee allowed the 20-day post-election period\\nto expire without repaying any portion of the $260,000\\ndebt it owed to Senator Cruz, an FEC regulation required the committee to recharacterize $10,000 of that\\ndebt\\xe2\\x80\\x94i.e., the increment above the $250,000 statutory\\ncap\\xe2\\x80\\x94as a contribution to the campaign. See App., infra, 9a; 11 C.F.R. 116.11(c)(2). It is that regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nnot the statutory loan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94that today\\nprevents the committee from raising and using postelection funds to repay the remainder of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloan. As a result, whether or not appellees had standing\\nto challenge the regulation, see pp. 13-16, infra (explaining that self-inflicted injury does not give rise to\\nArticle III standing), they lacked standing to challenge\\nthe statute. See Transunion LLC v. Ramirez, No. 20297 (June 25, 2021), slip op. 20 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[A] plaintiff must\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief\\nsought.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted).\\niv. Based on the record evidence described above,\\nwhich had been assembled after the single-judge district court denied the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to dismiss,\\nthe FEC informed the three-judge court that the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $250,000 repayment to Senator Cruz had been\\nmade with pre-election funds. See SMF \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 60, 64. On\\nthe merits, the FEC relied in part on the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nuse of pre-election funds to repay that amount as evidence that appellees had suffered no burden of constitutional magnitude as a result of BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment\\nlimit. See FEC Mot. for Summ. J. 16; FEC Reply in\\nSupp. of Mot. for Summ. J. 16, 17, 18. The Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmotion for summary judgment did not, however, ask the\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nthree-judge court to revisit the Article III standing\\nanalysis that had been adopted by the single judge and\\nlater embraced by the three-judge court. As noted\\nabove, despite the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s references to the record evidence showing that pre-election funds had been used,\\nthe three-judge district court repeated the single-judge\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s earlier assertion that the $250,000 loan repayment had been made with post-election funds. See App.,\\ninfra, 9a.\\nAlthough the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion for summary judgment\\ndid not ask the three-judge district court to revisit\\nstanding, the court had \\xe2\\x80\\x9can independent obligation to\\ndetermine whether subject-matter jurisdiction exists,\\neven in the absence of a challenge from any party.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arbaugh v.

Here, the only\\ninjury identified by the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x94Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloss of $10,000\\xe2\\x80\\x94was self-inflicted.\\nSenator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s committee had approximately $2.2\\nmillion in pre-election funds left on hand after the election. App., infra, 43a. If it had used those funds to pay\\nSenator Cruz $10,000 or more in the 20 days after the\\nelection, it could lawfully have used post-election contributions to pay any remaining portion of the debt, thus\\nensuring that Senator Cruz was fully repaid. See p. 3,\\nsupra. The committee simply chose not to do so. Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loss of $10,000 thus was attributable to appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal choice[s],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not to any action by the\\nFEC.

Under this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprecedents, however, a plaintiff \\xe2\\x80\\x99s belief that the government has violated the Constitution does not by itself\\ngive him standing. See, e.g., United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 175 (1974). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cArticle III grants federal\\ncourts the power to redress harms that defendants\\ncause plaintiffs, not a freewheeling power to hold defendants accountable for legal infractions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d TransUnion, slip op. 11 (citation omitted); see id. at 1, 27 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNo\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nconcrete harm, no standing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).

Adams,\\n141 S. Ct. 493, 499 (2020) (citation omitted).\\nTo be sure, appellees could have sought to establish\\ntheir standing by demonstrating that using pre-election\\nfunds to repay Senator Cruz during the 20-day postelection window would itself have injured them in some\\nconcrete way. See, e.g., Natural Resources Defense\\nCouncil, Inc. v. United States Food & Drug Administration, 710 F.3d 71, 85 (2d Cir. 2013) (holding that an\\ninjury was not self-inflicted because taking the action\\nneeded to avoid that injury would have subjected the\\nplaintiff to a different harm). Appellees, however, have\\nnot shown that they would have suffered any concrete\\nharm from disbursing $10,000 in pre-election funds to\\nSenator Cruz within the 20-day regulatory deadline.\\nAppellees argued below that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Cruz Committee had\\na First Amendment right to prioritize its spending of\\npre-election contributions by paying vendors and other\\ncreditors rather than reimbursing Senator Cruz, and\\nthe Government cannot demand that the Committee\\ngive up that right to avoid the financial injury resulting\\nfrom an unconstitutional statute.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 29, at 41\\n(June 28, 2019). But appellees did not identify any specific payment to a vendor or other creditor that the\\nCommittee would have been hindered from making if it\\nhad used $10,000 of pre-election funds to reduce the\\ndebt that it owed to Senator Cruz. Cf. Defenders of\\nWildlife, 504 U.S. at 563 (to establish standing, organizations that sought to challenge federal activities that\\nallegedly harmed endangered and threatened species\\n\\n\\x0c16\\noutside the United States were required to show,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthrough specific facts, not only that listed species were\\nin fact being threatened by funded activities abroad, but\\nalso that one or more of respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 members would\\nthereby be \\xe2\\x80\\x98directly\\xe2\\x80\\x99 affected\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). And because the funds\\nwith which the committee ultimately repaid the\\n$250,000 were in the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possession on the date\\nof the election, and remained in its possession until after\\nthe 20-day post-election window had expired, it is difficult to see how their use for loan-repayment purposes\\nduring that window would have impaired the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to pay other creditors.\\nIndeed, far from identifying any specific actual or\\nthreatened impairment of their ability to pay vendors\\nor other creditors, appellees stipulated below that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nsole and exclusive motivation behind Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions in making the 2018 loan and the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions in waiting to repay them was to establish the factual basis for this challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMF \\xc2\\xb6 56 (citation omitted).

The three-judge district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s merits holding is\\nalso erroneous. Contrary to the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, the\\nloan-repayment limit does not violate the First Amendment.\\n\\n\\x0c17\\na. The First Amendment allows Congress to regulate the financing of political campaigns. See, e.g.,\\nBuckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 26-27 (1976) (per curiam).\\nUnder this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedents, the level of scrutiny that\\napplies to such a regulation depends on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe magnitude\\nof the burdens imposed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S.\\n581, 591 (2005). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat is, the strength of the governmental interest must reflect the seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis v.\\nFEC, 554 U.S. 724, 744 (2008). The Court has applied a\\nstringent standard to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpenditure limitations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which\\nimpose \\xe2\\x80\\x9csevere restrictions on protected freedoms,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but\\na less stringent standard to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontribution limitations,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwhich impose more \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmarginal restriction[s].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Buckley,\\n424 U.S. at 21, 23.\\nThe loan-repayment limit imposes at most a modest\\nburden on First Amendment rights. It does not limit\\nthe amount of money that a candidate may spend, the\\namount of money that a campaign may borrow, the\\namount of money that a candidate may raise, or the\\namount of money that a donor may contribute to a campaign. It does not even impose a ceiling on a campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nability to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans; so long as the campaign uses pre-election funds, it may repay the candidate in full no matter how large the debt. The limit instead imposes a narrow timing restriction: it affects a\\ncampaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to use a pool of funds raised at a particular time (after the election) for a particular purpose\\n(repaying personal loans made by the candidate). And\\neven that restriction on the use of post-election funds to\\nrepay the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans applies only to the\\nextent that such repayments exceed $250,000.\\n\\n\\x0c18\\nThe district court believed that the loan-repayment\\nlimit burdens speech by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstrict[ing] candidate lending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscouraging the personal financing of campaign speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 15a. That assertion lacks a\\nsound basis in the record. Most loans to election campaigns are for $250,000 or less, and thus are not affected\\nby the loan-repayment limit. For example, during the\\nfive most recent election cycles, nearly 80% of the loans\\nmade by Senate candidates and nearly 90% of the loans\\nmade by House candidates were for $250,000 or less.\\nSee SMF \\xc2\\xb6 38-39. Further, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he ratio of loans below\\n$250,000 has not changed substantially from what the\\nratio was prior to BCRA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xb6 40. That pattern suggests that, contrary to the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speculation, the loanrepayment limit has not meaningfully discouraged the\\nfinancing of campaign speech.\\nThe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns are particularly misplaced on the facts of this case. The loan at issue here\\nwas not made for the purpose of facilitating \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccampaign\\nspeech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 15a. Senator Cruz made the loan\\nthe day before the election, and he transparently tailored the loan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $260,000 amount to facilitate this challenge to the $250,000 loan-repayment cap, while limiting\\n(to $10,000) the personal financial loss that he might\\nsuffer if his constitutional challenge is ultimately unsuccessful. See p. 14, supra. Indeed, appellees have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstipulate[d] that the sole and exclusive motivation behind\\nSenator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions in making the 2018 loan * * *\\nwas to establish the factual basis for this challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSMF \\xc2\\xb6 56.\\nThe statutory limit also did not have the effect of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstrict[ing] candidate lending.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 15a. As\\nexplained above, the committee had more than $2 million in pre-election funds left over after the election, and\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nit could easily have used those funds to repay Senator\\nCruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan in full or in part during the first 20 days after the election. It simply chose not to do so, again with\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sole and exclusive motivation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablish[ing] a\\nfactual basis for this challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMF \\xc2\\xb6 56; see pp. 14,\\n16, supra. As applied in this case, the loan-repayment\\nlimit thus did not impose any meaningful constraint on\\nappellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expression.\\nb. The interests served by the loan-repayment limit\\namply justify this modest burden on speech. Congress\\nhas a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate and compelling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d interest in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpreventing corruption or the appearance of corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FEC\\nv. National Conservative Political Action Committee,\\n470 U.S. 480, 496 (1985). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political quid pro quo\\nfrom current and potential office holders, the integrity\\nof our system of representative democracy is undermined.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27. And avoiding the\\nappearance of corruption is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccritical if confidence in the\\nsystem of representative Government is not to be\\neroded to a disastrous extent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 27 (citation and\\nellipsis omitted).\\nFor three reasons, the use of post-election contributions to repay personal loans creates a heightened risk\\nof actual and apparent quid pro quo corruption. First,\\nmoney that repays a personal loan after an election effectively goes into the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket. A payment\\nthat adds to a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal wealth (and that can\\naccordingly be used for personal purposes) poses a\\ngreater threat of quid pro quo corruption than a payment that merely adds to a campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treasury (and\\nthat can accordingly be used only for campaign purposes). Common sense suggests, for example, that the\\n\\n\\x0c20\\nrisk of corruption is greater when an officeholder receives $2900 that he can use to pay down his mortgage\\nthan when he receives $2900 that his campaign can use\\nto pay for more placards. Cf. 52 U.S.C. 30114(a) (identifying permissible uses of campaign contributions);\\n52 U.S.C. 30114(b)(1) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA contribution or donation described in subsection (a) shall not be converted by any\\nperson to personal use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); FEC v. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Donnell, 209\\nF. Supp. 3d 727, 739-740 (D. Del. 2016) (upholding prohibition on the use of campaign contributions to defray\\nthe candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal expenses).\\nSecond, a donor who contributes money before an\\nelection does not yet know whether the recipient of the\\ncontribution will prevail, but a donor who contributes\\nafter an election does. In other words, the donor can\\nknow (rather than merely hope) that the recipient will\\nbe in a position to do him official favors. That markedly\\nincreases the risk that the contribution is (or will appear\\nto the public to be) part of a quid pro quo arrangement.\\nThird, the primary legitimate rationales for donating to electoral campaigns do not apply to contributions\\nthat postdate the electoral campaign to which the contributions are directed. The most obvious legitimate\\nreasons for contributing to a political campaign are (1)\\npooling resources with other donors to facilitate political expression and (2) increasing, at least marginally,\\nthe likelihood that the favored candidate will prevail. A\\npost-election contribution serves neither of those purposes. It does not facilitate additional political expression, for the campaign has already ended. And it does\\nnot increase the likelihood that the favored candidate\\nwill prevail, for the election has already occurred. A\\npost-election contribution is thus more likely than a preelection contribution to be motivated by an expectation\\n\\n\\x0c21\\nof special favors from the recipient. Cf. Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, 438 U.S. 567, 577 (1978) (explaining that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen all legitimate reasons\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for an action \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave been eliminated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one may infer that the actor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbased his decision on an impermissible consideration\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe longstanding practice of regulating personal\\ngifts to public officials supports the congressional judgment underlying the loan-repayment limit. Rules adopted\\nby the Senate and House of Representatives restrict\\nmembers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts worth $50 or more. See\\nStanding Rule of the Senate XXXV (2013); House Rule\\nXXV.5 (2019). That limit is far smaller than the amount\\n(currently $2900 per election) that an individual may\\ncontribute to a federal candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign. See App.,\\ninfra, 6a n.1; 52 U.S.C. 30116(a) and (c). Regulations\\nadopted by the Executive Branch restrict federal employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts worth $20 or more from persons whose interests may be affected by the performance of the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 official duties. See 5 C.F.R.\\n2635.204. Regulations adopted by the Judicial Conference likewise restrict judges\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts. See\\nJudicial Conference, Code of Conduct for United States\\nJudges, Canon 4(D)(4) (2019). The loan-repayment\\nlimit rests on the same common-sense judgment as\\nthose rules: a payment that goes into a public official\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npocket creates a serious danger of actual or apparent\\ncorruption.\\nIn sum, the loan-repayment limit imposes at most a\\nmarginal restriction on speech to promote an interest of\\nthe highest order. Because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe strength of the governmental interest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d outweighs \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe seriousness of the actual burden on First Amendment rights,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the limit complies with the Constitution. Davis, 554 U.S. at 744.\\n\\n\\x0c22\\nc. The district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contrary rationales lack\\nmerit. The court faulted the FEC for failing to produce\\nempirical evidence that the loan-repayment limit prevents the reality or appearance of corruption. App., infra, 21a-30a. This Court has explained, however, that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he quantum of empirical evidence needed to satisfy\\nheightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments\\nwill vary up or down with the novelty and plausibility of\\nthe justification raised.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nixon v. Shrink Missouri\\nGovernment PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 391 (2000). The judgment underlying the loan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94that payments that go directly into a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket raise a\\nparticularly serious risk of corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x94is neither novel\\nnor implausible, but instead underlies conflict-of-interest\\nrules that apply to officials in all three Branches of the\\nfederal government. And because the loan-repayment\\nlimit has now been in place for 20 years, the district\\ncourt should have \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecogniz[ed] that no data can be\\nmarshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world\\nin which [such] limits do not exist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCutcheon v.\\nFEC, 572 U.S. 185, 219 (2014) (opinion of Roberts, C.J.).\\nIn any event, the Commission presented extensive\\nempirical evidence that the loan-repayment limit helps\\nto prevent the reality and appearance of corruption.\\nFor instance, the FEC cited a study showing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindebted politicians, relative to their debt-free counterparts, are significantly more likely to switch their votes\\nif they receive contributions from * * * special interests between the votes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMF \\xc2\\xb6 67 (citation omitted).\\nThe FEC identified numerous episodes in which officeholders had awarded government contracts and other\\nspecial favors after receiving contributions designed to\\npay down personal debt. Id. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 69-81. And it cited opinion polling showing that more than 80% of respondents\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nbelieved that individuals who donate money to a campaign after an election expect political favors in return.\\nId. \\xc2\\xb6 90.\\nThe district court also concluded that the limit is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cover inclusive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it \\xe2\\x80\\x9capplies across the board to\\nwinning and losing candidates, although any purported\\nanticorruption rationale applies only to winning candidates.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 31a. That rationale, too, is mistaken. First, as a general matter, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca person to whom a\\nstatute may constitutionally be applied will not be heard\\nto challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably be applied unconstitutionally to others, in\\nother situations not before the Court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610 (1973). Senator Cruz won the\\n2018 election, and the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anticorruption rationale applies to winning candidates with full force.\\nWhether the loan-repayment limit would be constitutional as applied to a losing candidate is a separate question not presented in this case.\\nSecond, to the extent that First Amendment overbreadth doctrine allows a litigant vicariously to assert\\nthe rights of third parties, the litigant must still show\\nthat the challenged law is \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstantially overbroad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cin\\nrelation to the statute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plainly legitimate sweep.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBroadrick, 413 U.S. at 615. Appellees have not satisfied\\nthat standard here; evidence in the record showed that\\npost-election contributions generally flow to winning\\ncandidates and that the loan-repayment limit has little\\neffect on losing candidates. SMF \\xc2\\xb6 42. Third, establishing separate rules for winning and losing candidates\\nwould have risked creating the kind of \\xe2\\x80\\x9casymmetrical\\ncontribution scheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that this Court has previously\\nfound unconstitutional. Davis, 554 U.S. at 735.\\n\\n\\x0c24\\nAfter concluding that the loan-repayment limit restricts too much speech, the district court concluded\\nthat it restricts too little. App., infra, 32a-33a. The\\ncourt found the limit \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstantially underinclusive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it applies to candidate loans but not to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother\\ntypes of campaign debt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; because it applies to post-election\\ncontributions but not to contributions made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbefore the\\nelection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; and because it permits \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpost-election contributions to retire pre-election debt * * * up to the\\n$250,000 cap.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ibid. That analysis is misconceived.\\nContributions that repay candidate loans differ fundamentally from contributions that repay third-party\\nloans, since the former personally enrich the candidates\\nwhile the latter do not. Pre-election contributions likewise differ fundamentally from post-election contributions, since the latter are made after the winner of the\\nelection is known and are particularly likely to reflect\\nan expectation of special favors. See p. 20, supra. And\\nalthough Congress could have prohibited all uses of\\npost-election contributions to repay personal loans\\nmade by candidates to their campaigns, its decision to\\npermit such repayments up to the $250,000 cap reflects\\nan effort to accommodate candidates who wish to use\\npersonal loans as a method of campaign financing. In\\nall events, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe First Amendment imposes no freestanding \\xe2\\x80\\x98underinclusiveness limitation.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Williams-Yulee v.\\nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015) (citation omitted).\\nThis Court should not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpunish [Congress] for leaving\\nopen more, rather than fewer, avenues of expression,\\nespecially when there is no indication that the selective\\nrestriction of speech reflects a pretextual motive.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 452.\\nFinally, the district court found the loan-repayment\\nlimit unconstitutional because it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[l]ayered on top\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\x0c25\\nof base limits on campaign contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x94limits that, in\\nthe court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view, already adequately combated corruption and its appearance. App., infra, 34a. But as shown\\nabove, a contribution made after an election to repay a\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loan poses a heightened risk of corruption, over and above the risk posed by a pre-election\\ncontribution in the same amount. See pp. 19-21, supra.\\nThe First Amendment permits Congress to adopt \\xe2\\x80\\x9can\\nadditional restriction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App., infra, 34a, to address that\\nadditional danger.\\n3. The district court thus erred both in holding that\\nappellees have standing to challenge BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment limit, and in declaring unconstitutional a provision of an Act of Congress. This Court should summarily vacate the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and remand\\nthe case for further consideration of standing in light of\\nthe Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervening decision in California. Alternatively, the Court should set the case for plenary consideration. *\\n\\n* This Court may set a direct appeal for plenary consideration\\nthrough either an order noting probable jurisdiction or an order\\npostponing consideration of jurisdiction. See Sup. Ct. R. 18.12. Because the FEC has advanced a substantial argument that appellees\\nlack standing, the appropriate course here\\xe2\\x80\\x94if the Court declines to\\nvacate the judgment below\\xe2\\x80\\x94would be to postpone consideration of\\njurisdiction.

In recognition of the centrality of free speech to our democracy, the Supreme Court has consistently held that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nFirst Amendment \\xe2\\x80\\x98has its fullest and most urgent application\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to speech uttered during a campaign for political\\noffice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Eu v. San Fran. Cnty. Dem. Cent. Comm., 489\\nU.S. 214, 223 (1989) (quoting Monitor Patriot Co. v.\\nRoy, 401 U.S. 265, 272 (1971)). Protections for political\\nspeech extend to campaign financing because effective\\n\\n\\x0c6a\\nspeech requires spending money.\\nSee Buckley v.\\nValeo, 424 U.S. 1, 19-23 (1976) (per curiam).\\nThis case raises a constitutional challenge to a somewhat obscure campaign finance restriction that limits\\nthe amount of post-election contributions that may be\\nused to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-election loans. Section\\n304 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 prohibits candidates from using post-election contributions\\nto repay personal loans over $250,000. See 52 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 30116( j) (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Senator Rafael Edward \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cruz and his campaign committee\\nTed Cruz for Senate brought this suit to invalidate and\\nenjoin the enforcement of Section 304 and its implementing regulation. We find that the loan-repayment\\nlimit burdens political speech and thus implicates the\\nprotection of the First Amendment. Because the government has failed to demonstrate that the loan-repayment\\nlimit serves an interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, or that the limit is sufficiently tailored to serve\\nthis purpose, the loan-repayment limit runs afoul of the\\nFirst Amendment. We therefore grant summary judgment for Senator Cruz and his campaign.\\nI.\\nA.\\nCandidates for federal office require substantial funds\\nto support their campaigns. Funding may come from\\nindividual contributions, which are subject to a perelection cap. 1 See Federal Election Campaign Act of\\nThe current base limit is set at $2,900 per election. See 86 Fed.\\nReg. 7,867, 7,869 (Feb. 2, 2021). A primary election, general election, runoff election, and special election are treated as separate\\nelections. See 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30101(1)(A).\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c7a\\n1971 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFECA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Pub. L.

See\\n11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 110.10; see also Buckley, 424 U.S. at 51-54.\\nSelf-financing often takes the form of loans, either from\\na candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal funds or through a third-party\\nlender. A campaign may repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans using contributions received both before and after the\\nelection. Under Section 304 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), however, a campaign may repay only $250,000 of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s preelection loans with post-election contributions. See\\nPub. L. No. 107-155, \\xc2\\xa7 304, 116 Stat. 81 (codified at 52\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116( j)).\\nThe loan-repayment limit intersects with other restrictions on the use of campaign contributions promulgated by the Federal Election Commission (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFEC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommission\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). For instance, an individual may designate a contribution for a particular election, including a\\nprevious election. See 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 110.1(b)(2)(i). If\\ndesignated for a previous election, a contribution may\\nbe accepted \\xe2\\x80\\x9conly to the extent that [it] does not exceed\\nnet debts outstanding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from that election. See id.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 110.1(b)(3)(i). A campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnet debts outstanding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nfor an election equals the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctotal amount of unpaid debts\\nand obligations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d minus its total available resources.\\nId. \\xc2\\xa7 110.1(b)(3)(ii)(A)-(C). A campaign may accept\\npostelection contributions only to the extent necessary\\nto pay down a net shortfall. To effectuate the loanrepayment limit in Section 304, the calculation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnet\\ndebts outstanding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d excludes the amount of any candidate loans \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat in the aggregate exceed $250,000 per\\n\\n\\x0c8a\\nelection.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 110.1(b)(3)(ii)(C). The $250,000 limit applies to third-party loans secured by the candidate and\\nalso to loans from the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal funds. See\\nid. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(a).\\nA campaign has two options to pay back a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npersonal loans. First, a campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]ay repay the entire amount of the personal loans using contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nmade before the election. Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(1). If the campaign chooses to use pre-election contributions, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit must\\ndo so within 20 days of the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(c)(1).\\nSecond, pursuant to Section 304, a campaign may repay\\nup to $250,000 of the personal loans with post-election\\ncontributions. After the election, any balance of the\\npersonal loan that exceeds $250,000 will be treated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a\\ncontribution by the candidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(c)(2).\\nB.\\nThis case arose from Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 campaign\\nfor reelection to the United States Senate. The day before the general election, Senator Cruz made two loans\\ntotaling $260,000 to his campaign: $5,000 from his personal bank account and $255,000 from a third-party lender\\nsecured with his personal assets. Senator Cruz won\\nreelection.\\nAfter the election, Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign had almost $2.5 million in debt against approximately $2.2 million in cash on hand. The campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x9cused the funds it\\nhad on hand to pay vendors and meet other obligations\\ninstead of repaying [Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Compl.\\n\\xc2\\xb6 29, ECF No. 1. The campaign did not use any preelection funds within twenty days of the election to repay the Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans, as Section 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementing\\n\\n\\x0c9a\\nregulation would have permitted. Instead, the campaign repaid Senator Cruz the maximum $250,000 with\\npost-election contributions but Section 304 prevented\\nthe campaign from paying back the final $10,000. The\\n$10,000 balance of those loans was subsequently deemed\\na campaign contribution from Senator Cruz.\\nSenator Cruz and his campaign (collectively, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCruz campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) brought suit against the FEC, alleging that Section 304 of BCRA and its implementing regulation, 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11, violate the First Amendment. The complaint contends that the loan-repayment\\nlimit unconstitutionally infringes the First Amendment\\nrights of Senator Cruz, his campaign, other candidates,\\nand any individuals who might seek to make post-election\\ncontributions. Because the complaint concerned a constitutional challenge to a provision of BCRA, the Cruz\\ncampaign also applied for a three-judge district court\\npursuant to Section 403 of BCRA and 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2284.\\nThe FEC moved to dismiss for lack of standing and also\\nargued that a three-judge court would not have subject\\nmatter jurisdiction. The one-judge district court denied the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to dismiss, held the Cruz campaign had standing to challenge the loan-repayment\\nlimit, and granted the Cruz campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application for a\\nthree-judge district court.

First, we assess whether the loan-repayment limit burdens political speech and thus implicates the protection of the First Amendment.

Moreover, the loan-repayment limit has only a tenuous connection to the asserted\\ngovernment interest in preventing corruption and thus\\nlacks the close tailoring necessary under the First\\nAmendment.\\nA.\\nWhen presented with a less familiar type of campaign\\nfinance regulation, we must determine at the outset\\nwhether the restriction burdens the exercise of political\\nspeech. See id. at 203-06; Ariz. Free Enter. Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564 U.S. 721, 736-47 (2011);\\nDavis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 738-40 (2008). The Cruz\\ncampaign argues the loan-repayment limit burdens\\nspeech by limiting campaign expenditures and contributions. The FEC maintains the limit does not burden\\nspeech at all. We find the loan-repayment limit burdens political speech and thus implicates the protection\\nof the First Amendment.\\nThe First Amendment provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress shall\\nmake no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nU.S. CONST. amend.

Robust and free political discussion is essential to the republican form of government\\nestablished by our Constitution.

Because financing for political campaigns implicates the freedom to speak and to associate, the Supreme Court has long recognized that limitations on\\ncampaign spending \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnecessarily reduce[] the quantity of\\nexpression by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of their exploration, and the size of the\\naudience reached.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 19.\\nSince Buckley, the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decisions have focused on\\nidentifying whether a restriction on campaign finance\\nburdens expenditures or contributions, in part because\\nthe distinction can affect the standard of review. 3 See\\nid. at 25, 44-45. But it is well established that both expenditures and contributions implicate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfundamental\\nFirst Amendment activities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 14. When a candidate makes expenditures on behalf of her campaign,\\nshe exercises her right to speak; and when a contributor\\ndonates to that campaign, he exercises the right to associate with the candidate and to express his support.\\nThe contributions to a campaign in turn promote more\\nexpenditures and political speech by the candidate.\\nIn recent decisions, the Court has declined to eliminate the distinction between expenditures and contributions even as it has focused on speech interests more\\ngenerally. See, e.g., McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 199; id.\\nat 228 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment) (suggesting that the distinction between expenditures and\\n\\nWhile burdens on expenditures must withstand strict scrutiny,\\nthe Court has assessed burdens on contributions under a less demanding, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbut still \\xe2\\x80\\x98rigorous standard of review.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCutcheon,\\n572 U.S. at 197 (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 29).\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c13a\\ncontributions \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas only continued to erode in the intervening years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (cleaned up). The Court has emphasized the central question of whether and how a challenged regulation burdens political speech. For example, in McCutcheon, the Court explained that Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndistinction between expenditure and contribution limits\\nstemmed from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe degree to which each encroaches\\nupon protected First Amendment interests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n197. The Court assessed the burden on expressive and\\nassociational rights imposed by the aggregate contribution limits challenged in that case. See id. at 204-05.\\nIn Davis, the Court found that a regulation burdened a\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expenditures because it raised contribution\\nlimits asymmetrically, that is, only for the opponents of\\na candidate who spent over a certain amount of his own\\nmoney. See 554 U.S. at 738-40. The Court focused on\\nhow the regulation functioned to analyze the burden\\nthat it imposed. See id.; see also Bennett, 564 U.S. at\\n736-47 (evaluating the specific operation of Arizona\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmatching funds provision and holding that it substantially burdened speech). In a political campaign, expenditures and contributions are part of a connected cycle of speech and association protected by the First\\nAmendment.\\nWe find that the loan-repayment limit restricts political expression and association for candidates and their\\ncontributors. To begin with, the loan-repayment limit\\nburdens candidates who wish to make expenditures\\nthrough personal loans because the limit constrains the\\n\\n\\x0c14a\\nrepayment options available to the candidate. 4 Whereas other campaign debts may be repaid by post-election\\ncontributions, candidate loans above $250,000 do not receive the same treatment. That the candidate makes a\\nchoice to finance his campaign with personal loans, rather than through other forms of debt, does not minimize the First Amendment harm. Cf. Davis, 554 U.S.\\nat 739 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe resulting drag on First Amendment rights\\nis not constitutional simply because it attaches as a consequence of a statutorily imposed choice.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Candidate\\nloans comprise the majority of campaign debt, and personal loans will sometimes be the only way for a candidate to raise enough money for an effective campaign in\\nthe short term. The limit places a particular burden on\\nrelatively unknown challengers who may require more\\nfinancing up front in order to wage an effective campaign against a better funded incumbent. See Anderson v. Spear, 356 F.3d 651, 673 (6th Cir. 2004) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[A] candidate may need to speak early in order to establish her\\nposition and garner contributions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nWe also note that since the enactment of BCRA and\\nthe loan-repayment limit, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere is a clear clustering of\\nIn general, a loan from a candidate to his campaign is treated as\\nan expenditure.

During this same time period, the percentage of\\ncandidate loans above $250,000 has remained roughly\\nthe same while spending on Senate and House campaigns has more than doubled, indicating that the loanrepayment limit constricts candidate lending.\\nWe find the burden imposed by Section 304 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis evident and inherent in the choice that confronts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d candidates who wish to use personal loans to finance their\\ncampaigns.

At the time of the enactment of the First\\nAmendment, as well as today, the plain meaning of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cabridge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to diminish or to curtail the freedom of\\nspeech. Consistent with this meaning, the First Amendment protects individuals not only from direct and outright bans on speech, but also indirect actions the government might take to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabridge\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the central freedom to\\nspeak freely in the democratic process.\\nFollowing these general principles, the Supreme Court\\nhas found a First Amendment burden even absent an\\noutright ban or cap, when the regulation acted as a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdrag\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on speech\\xe2\\x80\\x94which is to say an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabridgment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nspeech. Davis, 554 U.S. at 739-40. In Davis, the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a provision of BCRA\\nthat relaxed the base contribution limits for a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opponents if the candidate spent more than\\n$350,000 of his own funds.

See 564 U.S. at 728. The Court\\nconcluded that the Arizona law \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplainly force[d] the privately financed candidate to \\xe2\\x80\\x98shoulder a special and potentially significant burden\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when choosing to exercise\\nhis First Amendment right to spend funds on behalf of\\nhis candidacy.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 737 (quoting Davis, 554 U.S. at\\n739). If the law curtails a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to speak\\non his behalf, it runs afoul of the First Amendment even\\nwhen the law is not an outright ban.\\nThe FEC seeks to distinguish Davis and Bennett because those cases involved a penalty for candidate speech\\nabove a certain threshold, whereas the loan-repayment\\nlimit has no similar penalty\\xe2\\x80\\x94by loaning his campaign\\nmore than $250,000 a candidate does not indirectly fund\\nhis opponent through either liberalized, asymmetrical\\ncontribution limits (Davis) or matching funds (Bennett).\\nFirst Amendment burdens, however, are not limited to\\nprescribed forms. Our review must scrutinize regulatory burdens in order to vigorously protect the freedom\\nof speech. While not identical to previously challenged\\n\\n\\x0c18a\\nregulations, the loan-repayment limit restricts a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign expenditures by circumscribing the repayment options for candidate loans over $250,000. 5\\nThe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insistence that the loan-repayment limit\\ndoes not burden political speech overlooks the reality of\\nhow the limit functions. The FEC narrowly focuses on\\nthe repayment of the loan and through this lens notes\\nthat the loan-repayment limit does not restrict expenditures because the candidate remains free to loan or contribute as much money as he wishes to his campaign. 6\\nThe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cramped understanding of the First Amendment fails to provide adequate protection to the important free speech interests at stake. The FEC would\\nisolate the transactions at issue until they no longer resemble campaign expenditures or contributions.\\n\\nOn the flip side, the loan-repayment limit may also impact contributors. Candidate loans over $250,000 are singled out and excluded from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnet debts outstanding\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that a campaign may pay\\noff with post-election contributions. The FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations permit\\ncontributors to designate their contributions for a prior election.\\nAn individual who wanted to contribute to Senator Cruz after the\\n2018 election could not have contributed to\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thus expressed his\\nsupport for\\xe2\\x80\\x94Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 election campaign if the only debt\\nremaining was the Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan in excess of $250,000.\\n6\\nThe FEC suggests there is no restriction on political speech in\\nthis case, relying on FEC v. O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Donnell, 209 F. Supp. 3d 727 (D. Del.\\n2016). That case is inapposite, however, because it concerned\\nFECA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ban on the use of contributions to pay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal\\nexpenses. The court held such contributions did not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfacilitate\\npolitical expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 739. By contrast, the loan-repayment\\nlimit restricts political expression and implicates the First Amendment in a way that personal expenses for a new outfit and a gym\\nmembership arguably do not. See 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30114(b)(2)(B) & (I).\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c19a\\nIn determining whether First Amendment interests\\nare implicated, however, we must focus on whether a\\nstatute burdens political speech, not whether a particular regulatory label is a perfect fit. The relative novelty of a campaign finance regulation cannot insulate it\\nfrom judicial scrutiny because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitical speech must\\nprevail against laws that would suppress it, whether by\\ndesign or inadvertence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Citizens United v. FEC, 558\\nU.S. 310, 340 (2010). Legislators may try different\\nregulatory approaches to protect against quid pro quo\\ncorruption; however, any such regulation of campaigns\\nmust comport with the First Amendment.\\nThe loan-repayment limit implicates First Amendment interests. A candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan to his campaign is\\nan expenditure that may be used for expressive acts.\\nSuch expressive acts are burdened when a candidate is\\ninhibited from making a personal loan, or incurring one,\\nout of concern that she will be left holding the bag on\\nany unpaid campaign debt.\\nThis case illustrates the reality that contributions\\nand expenditures are often \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctwo sides of the same First\\nAmendment coin.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 241 (Burger,\\nC.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Contributions allow a candidate to make further expenditures, reflecting the practical link between the associational and expressive activity of the candidate and contributor. By limiting the amount of post-election contributions that can be used to retire candidate loans, the\\nloan-repayment limit abridges political speech and implicates the protection of the First Amendment.\\n\\n\\x0c20a\\nB.\\nBecause the loan-repayment limit encumbers political speech, the government has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe burden of proving\\nthe constitutionality of its actions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCutcheon, 572\\nU.S. at 210 (cleaned up). The parties dispute the relevant standard of review. The Cruz campaign maintains we should apply either the strict scrutiny applicable to expenditure limits or the closely drawn scrutiny\\napplied to contribution limits. By contrast, the FEC\\nsuggests the loan-repayment limit must be analyzed under deferential rational basis review because the limit\\nburdens no First Amendment interests. Because we\\nfind the loan-repayment limit restricts expressive and\\nassociational interests in political campaigns, we must\\napply a form of heightened scrutiny, either strict or\\nclosely drawn.\\nUnder either form of heightened scrutiny, we assess\\nthe government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asserted interest in restricting speech\\nand the fit between that interest and the means the government has chosen to fulfill it. See id. at 199. Applying strict scrutiny, a regulation will be upheld only if it\\nfurthers a compelling government interest and the government uses the least restrictive means of furthering\\nthat interest; whereas under closely drawn scrutiny a\\nregulation will be upheld \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif the State demonstrates a\\nsufficiently important interest and employs means closely\\ndrawn to avoid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d abridging First Amendment freedoms.\\nSee id. at 197.\\nThe loan-repayment limit fails under even the less\\nexacting test of closely drawn scrutiny and so, as in\\nMcCutcheon, we have no need to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cparse the differences\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nbetween the standards of scrutiny.

The media\\nreports merely hypothesize that individuals who contribute after the election to help retire a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndebt might have greater influence with or access to the\\ncandidate. Yet this is not evidence of quid pro quo corruption, and minimizing influence and access is not a\\nproper goal for campaign finance regulation.\\nThe\\nYouGov poll was conducted at the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behest for this\\nlitigation to demonstrate that the loan-repayment limit\\naddresses the appearance of corruption.

Such generic questions do not get at\\nthe specific problem of quid pro quo corruption the government asserts this statute combats. On the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasoning, the poll answers would raise doubts\\nabout any contributions to incumbents (i.e. winning candidates) who use post-election contributions to retire\\nany type of campaign debt. Even if contributors who\\ndonate to retire a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s debt expect political favors, that hardly demonstrates that the (now elected) official is more likely to grant such political favors. Moreover, the poll did not define the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitical favor,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so\\nthe poll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s responses are not evidence that the public associates such contributions with quid pro quo corruption, which Congress may regulate, or simply increased\\ninfluence and access, which Congress may not. See\\nMcCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 208. Finally, the poll failed to\\nmention that the individual contribution limit applies to\\npost-election contributions just as it does to pre-election\\n\\n\\x0c29a\\ncontributions. That omission renders the poll an ineffective measure of public perception of possible corruption in this context. At most, the poll suggests that\\nsome members of the public distrust or are skeptical\\nabout using contributions to repay candidate loans, but\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctendency to demonstrate distrust\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is insufficient to\\nestablish corruption or its appearance. Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Conserv.\\nPAC, 470 U.S. at 499. We conclude the FEC fails to\\ndemonstrate that the loan-repayment limit serves an interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption.\\nThe FEC also maintains that the loan-repayment\\nlimit prevents the circumvention of base contribution\\nlimits because without the limit a candidate could keep\\noutstanding loans from past campaigns, which would allow individuals to stack up maximum contributions for\\neach election for which the candidate had open loans.\\nThe problem with the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position, however, is that\\ncontributors are permitted to make multiple contributions at a single time\\xe2\\x80\\x94they can contribute to retire debt\\nfrom a previous election (subject to the loan-repayment\\nlimit) and they can contribute to any ongoing campaign\\nfor a future election. Each of these separate perelection contributions, however, is limited by the base\\ncontribution limit. Nothing about the potential for\\nstacking circumvents the base limits. What the FEC\\nterms \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccircumvention\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is in fact a lawful contribution\\nunder existing campaign finance laws.\\nThe government suggests it is dissatisfied with the\\npossibility of large one-time contributions, which the\\nFEC treats as a kind of legal loophole. Yet the loanrepayment limit does little to close the ostensible loophole, because the limit applies only to a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans, not to other campaign debt. Also, the FEC\\n\\n\\x0c30a\\nfails to identify a plausible financial incentive for a candidate to carry significant personal campaign debt over\\nmany years simply to keep open the possibility of soliciting larger stacked donations in the future.\\nIn sum, the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position amounts to speculation\\nthat contributions to pay off a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans\\ncarry a danger of quid pro quo corruption, but the Supreme Court has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnever accepted mere conjecture as\\nadequate to carry a First Amendment burden.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShrink Mo., 528 U.S. at 392. The government has\\nfailed to demonstrate that its interest in the loan-repayment limit is sufficiently important, because the limit\\nserves no additional purpose in preventing quid pro quo\\ncorruption or the circumvention of base contribution\\nlimits. With little connection to any actual or perceived\\nquid pro quo corruption interest, the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asserted rationale boils down to a general concern about money in\\npolitics and campaign contributions to incumbents\\xe2\\x80\\x94but\\nsuch general concerns about influence or access cannot\\njustify government regulation in the vital area of political speech.\\n2.\\nEven if the government had shown that the limit was\\njustified by an important government interest, the loanrepayment limit is not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to protect expressive and associational freedoms.

Id.\\nat 41.\\nContrary to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertions, the loan-repayment limit is not sufficiently tailored to achieve the\\nobjective of preventing quid pro quo corruption or its\\nappearance. To begin with, the loan-repayment limit is\\nover inclusive. It applies across the board to winning\\nand losing candidates, although any purported anticorruption rationale applies only to winning candidates.\\nThe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s primary defense of the regulation is that\\n\\n\\x0c32a\\npost-election contributions used to retire a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npersonal campaign loans are particularly susceptible to\\nquid pro quo corruption or its appearance. This justification, however, does not apply to candidates who lose\\nan election and therefore have no way to provide improper benefits to contributors who donate to retire\\nelection debt. Losing candidates are less likely to receive post-election contributions and, in any event, contributions made to a losing candidate pose essentially no\\nrisk of corruption or its appearance. See Anderson,\\n356 F.3d at 673 (invalidating a state cap on candidate\\nloans and explaining that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe risk of quid pro quo is\\nvirtually non-existent where the contribution is made to\\na losing candidate who seeks to recoup some of his\\ndebt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). When a campaign finance regulation sweeps in\\nconduct well beyond the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asserted rationale, it does not provide the close fit required by the\\nFirst Amendment.\\nThe loan-repayment limit is also substantially underinclusive as to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asserted interests.\\nAlthough \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe First Amendment imposes no freestanding underinclusiveness limitation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underinclusiveness can indicate a poor fit and can raise doubts\\nabout whether the law advances the interests invoked\\nby the government.

Here, aside from\\nthe loan-repayment and base contribution limits, there\\nare no restrictions on post-election contributions made\\nto retire other types of campaign debt. A person may\\ncontribute to retire any outstanding campaign debt,\\nwith the exception of a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans over\\n$250,000.\\nThe FEC argues that a candidate who\\n\\n\\x0c33a\\nmakes a loan to his campaign that he expects will be repaid is more dependent on outside contributions than a\\ncandidate who simply gives the money to his campaign.\\nYet not all candidates can afford to just give money to\\ntheir campaigns\\xe2\\x80\\x94and there is nothing inherently corrupting about receiving campaign contributions after an\\nelection.\\nThe FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns regarding post-election contributions to retire candidate loans seem to apply equally\\nto any contribution made to an incumbent, because all\\nincumbents are in a position to grant favors. But Congress does not restrict pre-election contributions to incumbents except through the base contribution limit.\\nThe government has advanced no reason why a contribution made to an incumbent before the election poses\\nno risk of corruption, but the same contribution made\\nafter the election to a winning candidate (now incumbent) and applied to pre-election debt poses a unique\\nand heightened concern of quid pro quo corruption.\\nThe government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fit rationale also cannot explain\\nwhy post-election contributions to retire pre-election\\ndebt are permissible up to the $250,000 cap. This cap\\nmeans that in the current election cycle, a campaign\\ncommittee can accept just over eighty-six maximum contributions after the election to repay a candidate loan\\n(eighty-six contributions of $2,900 aggregates to\\n$249,400, just shy of the $250,000 ceiling). It is hardly\\nclear why the eighty-seventh or eighty-eighth contributor poses a particular danger of quid pro corruption.\\nCf. McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 210. Instead, the $250,000\\ncap operates to limit or disincentivize the total amount\\nof campaign expenditure a candidate makes through\\npersonal loans.\\n\\n\\x0c34a\\nThe loan-repayment limit also imposes an additional\\nregulatory requirement on top of the existing base limits.

The Loan Repayment Limit\\nIn 2002, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Campaign\\nReform Act (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), Pub. L. No. 107-155, 116 Stat. 81,\\nwhich amended the Federal Election Campaign Act of\\n1971 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFECA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). One provision of BCRA states that a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccandidate who incurs personal loans . . . in connection with the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign for election shall not\\nrepay (directly or indirectly), to the extent such loans\\nexceed $250,000, such loans from any contributions\\nmade to such candidate or any authorized committee of\\nsuch candidate after the date of such election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 52\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116( j). The FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementing regulations clarify that BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $250,000 limit applies both to\\nloans secured by the candidate for the benefit of his\\ncampaign and to loans made to the campaign from the\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal funds. 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(a).\\nBCRA and its implementing regulations (collectively\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoan Repayment Limit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) thus give a campaign committee two options for paying back a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans after an election. First, the committee may\\nrepay up to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe entire amount of the personal loans using contributions to the candidate or the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authorized committee provided that those contributions\\nwere made on the day of the election or before.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(1). If the committee elects to use preelection contributions to repay all or part of the loan,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit must do so within 20 days of the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\xc2\\xb6 116.11(c)(1).\\n\\n\\x0c42a\\nAlternatively, the committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]ay repay up to\\n$250,000 of the personal loans from contributions made\\nto the candidate or the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authorized committee after the date of the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(2).\\nThere is no time limit on when the campaign may repay\\nthe $250,000 using post-election contributions; however,\\nthe committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]ust not repay . . . the aggregate\\namount of the personal loans that exceeds $250,000,\\nfrom contributions to the candidate or the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nauthorized committee if those contributions were made\\nafter the date of the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(3). After the 20-day post-election period has elapsed, the committee must \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreat the remaining balance of the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loan that exceeds $250,000 as a contribution from the candidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Increased Contribution\\nand Coordinated Party Expenditure Limits for Candidates Opposing Self-Financed Candidates, 68 Fed.

Judicial Review of Constitutional Challenges\\nto BCRA\\nSection 403 of BCRA provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f any action is\\nbrought for declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge\\nthe constitutionality of any provision of this Act[,] . . .\\n[t]he action shall be filed in the United States District\\nCourt for the District of Columbia and shall be heard by\\na 3-judge court convened pursuant to [28 U.S.C.] section\\n2284.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Pub.

The\\nparty seeking to convene a three-judge court must file a\\nrequest, whereupon \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe judge to whom the request is\\npresented shall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d initiate the process, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunless he determines that three judges are not required.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 2284(b)(1).

On the day before the November 6, 2018 general election, Senator\\nCruz made two loans totaling $260,000 to the Cruz Committee to help finance his campaign. See Compl., ECF\\nNo. 1 [hereinafter Compl.], \\xc2\\xb6 28; Ted Cruz for Senate,\\nFEC Form 3 at 401-02 (Jan. 31, 2019). 1 Of the $260,000\\nlent to the Committee, $5,000 originated from Senator\\nCruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal bank accounts and $255,000 originated\\nfrom a margin loan secured with Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal assets. Compl. \\xc2\\xb6 28.\\nAt the close of election day, the Cruz Committee had\\napproximately $2.2 million on hand and nearly $2.5 million in debts associated with the 2018 general election.\\nId. \\xc2\\xb6 29. The Committee then \\xe2\\x80\\x9cused the funds it had on\\nhand to pay vendors and meet other obligations instead\\nof repaying [Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. The Committee did not use any of the funds it had on hand to pay\\noff Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans during the 20-day period, meaning that after that period elapsed, the balance of those\\nloans that exceeded BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $250,000 statutory cap on\\npost-election contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x94$10,000\\xe2\\x80\\x94converted into\\na campaign contribution.

Plaintiffs allege that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]bsent the\\nrestrictions of [BCRA] and the Commission\\xe2\\x80\\x99s corresponding regulation[s],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould solicit debt-retirement funds from potential donors and would use postelection contributions to defray the remaining $10,000\\nloan balance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xb6 33.\\nC.\\n\\nProcedural History\\n\\nIn April 2019, Plaintiffs filed suit against the FEC,\\ncontending that: (1) the Loan Repayment Limit unconstitutionally infringes on their First Amendment\\nrights to freedom of speech; (2) the limit also infringes\\non the First Amendment free speech rights of potential\\npost-election donors; and (3) the implementing regulation, 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11, is contrary to law and arbitrary\\nand capricious. See Compl. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 5, 34-51. On the same\\nday, Plaintiffs filed a request to convene a three-judge\\ndistrict court pursuant to BCRA \\xc2\\xa7 403 and 28 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 2284. See Appl. For a Three-Judge Court, ECF No. 2.\\nThe FEC opposes Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 motion to appoint a\\nthree-judge court and seeks dismissal of Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nComplaint for lack of jurisdiction.

This Court Has Jurisdiction to Decide the Standing Question\\n\\nPlaintiffs contend that BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requirement that a\\nthree-judge court be convened to hear any \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d challenging BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s constitutionality precludes a singlejudge court from ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack\\nof standing in such an action. Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rigid reading\\nof the word \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d however, is foreclosed by binding\\nSupreme Court precedent.\\nSection 403 of BCRA provides that a three-judge district court shall adjudicate any \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction . . . brought\\nfor declaratory or injunctive relief to challenge the\\nconstitutionality of any provision of this Act.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BCRA\\n\\xc2\\xa7 403(a)(3). Though framed in mandatory terms, the\\nprovision cross-references 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2284, which provides that a single judge need not convene a three-judge\\n\\n\\x0c46a\\npanel if she \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdetermines that three judges are not required.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xc2\\xa7 2284(b)(2). The Supreme Court has held\\nthat a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthree-judge court is not required where the district court itself lacks jurisdiction [over] the complaint\\nor the complaint is not justiciable in the federal courts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nShapiro v. McManus, 136 S. Ct. 450, 455 (2015) (quoting\\nGonzalez v. Automatic Emp. Credit Union, 419 U.S. 90,\\n100 (1974)). A case is not justiciable in federal courts\\nwhen the plaintiff lacks standing, and therefore the absence of standing is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cground upon which a single judge\\n[may] decline[] to convene a three-judge court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See\\nGonzalez, 419 U.S. at 100.\\nPlaintiffs object that Gonzalez and Shapiro are inapposite because they did not involve a challenge to BCRA.\\nThey contend that BRCA is unique among other threejudge judicial review provisions because it requires a\\nthree-judge court to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadjudicate the entire \\xe2\\x80\\x98action\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nwhich includes . . . a pre-trial motion to dismiss for\\nlack of jurisdiction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 13. BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of\\nthe word \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not unique, however. Like BCRA,\\nthe statute at issue in Shapiro similarly requires the\\nconvening of a three-judge court to adjudicate the entire\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9caction,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2284(a), and yet the Supreme Court\\nhad no difficulty concluding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca district judge need\\nnot unthinkingly initiate the procedures to convene a\\nthree-judge court without first examining the allegations in the complaint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and determining whether it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clacks jurisdiction [over] the complaint,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Shapiro, 136\\nS. Ct. at 452; see also Wertheimer v. FEC, 268 F.3d 1070,\\n1072 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (finding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9can individual district\\ncourt judge may consider threshold jurisdictional challenges prior to convening a three-judge panel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under\\nthe Presidential Campaign Fund Act, which, like BCRA,\\n\\n\\x0c47a\\nrequires three-judge courts to hear applicable \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe D.C. Circuit has specifically applied Shapiro\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasoning in the context of BCRA, explaining that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca threejudge court is not required\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to hear a constitutional\\nchallenge to BCRA \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhere the district court itself lacks\\njurisdiction [over] the complaint or the complaint is not\\njusticiable in the federal courts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Indep. Inst. v. FEC,\\n816 F.3d 113, 116 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Shapiro, 136\\nS. Ct. at 455). 2 Consistent with this precedent, a host\\nof district courts have held that a single judge may dismiss a constitutional challenge to BCRA for lack of\\nstanding. See, e.g., Republican Party of La. v. FEC,\\n146 F. Supp. 3d 1, 8 (D.D.C. 2015); Rufer v. FEC, 64\\nF. Supp. 3d 195, 202 (D.D.C. 2014); Schonberg v. FEC,\\n792 F. Supp. 2d 14, 17 (D.D.C. 2011).\\nTo be sure, Shapiro was focused on a separate jurisdictional issue\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether a claim was too \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstitutionally insubstantial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to implicate the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s federal subject-matter jurisdiction\\xe2\\x80\\x94but there is no basis to distinguish between Article III jurisdiction (standing) and\\nfederal subject-matter jurisdiction (constitutional substantiality) for purposes of convening a three-judge\\ncourt. As with Article III standing, the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power\\nto dismiss a constitutionally insubstantial question does\\nnot hinge on any \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinterpretation of statutory text\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nBCRA or 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2284, but on the familiar proposition that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cessential\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jurisdictional prerequisites\\nmust be met before a single-judge court will exercise its\\njurisdiction to convene a three-judge panel.\\nSee\\nPlaintiffs argue that Independent Institute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement is dicta.\\nSee Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 14. Even if it is, the issue is still controlled by\\nShapiro and Gonzalez; therefore, the court does not consider this\\nargument further.\\n2\\n\\n\\x0c48a\\nShapiro, 136 S. Ct. at 455 (quoting Ex parte Poresky,\\n290 U.S. 30, 31(1933) (per curiam)); see also O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Hair v.\\nUnited States, 281 F. Supp. 815, 818 (D.D.C. 1968) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nfirst duty of the sole judge is to pass on the sufficiency\\nof the complaint specifically as to whether or not a justiciable controversy is presented over which he has adjudicatory powers, and if he determines that the Court\\nlacks jurisdiction, he must dismiss the suit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). As discussed below, Plaintiffs freely concede that a single\\njudge may dismiss a constitutionally insubstantial challenge to BCRA for lack of jurisdiction, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at\\n14; it follows that the same is true of a case where jurisdiction is lacking for want of standing.\\nAt oral argument, Plaintiffs sought to draw a line between these two jurisdictional inquiries, urging that the\\nquestion of constitutional substantiality is within the\\nsingle-judge court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jurisdiction because it goes to\\nwhether a constitutional question is raised at all\\xe2\\x80\\x94a necessary prerequisite to trigger BCRA \\xc2\\xa7 403\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judicial review requirement\\xe2\\x80\\x94whereas questions regarding a litigant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standing fall under the broad umbrella of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d challenging BCRA, and therefore must go to a\\nthree-judge court. That reading, however, is irreconcilable with Gonzalez, in which the Supreme Court held\\nthat it did not have mandatory jurisdiction over a threejudge court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal of a claim for lack of standing\\nbecause the lower court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot merely\\nshort of the ultimate merits; it was also, like an absence\\nof statutory subject-matter jurisdiction, a ground upon\\nwhich a single judge could have declined to convene\\na three-judge court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 419 U.S. at 100. The Court\\nacknowledged that, under the statute at issue, a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csingle\\n\\n\\x0c49a\\njudge is literally forbidden to \\xe2\\x80\\x98dismiss the action, or enter a summary or final judgment\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in any case required\\nto be heard by three judges,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it eschewed such a literalist reading, noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe have always recognized\\na single judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to dismiss a complaint for want of\\n. . . jurisdiction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 96 n. 14 (quoting 28 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 2284(5)). Thus, Gonzalez confirms that a single\\njudge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to dismiss a case on jurisdictional grounds\\ndoes not turn on the type of jurisdictional question presented, even when, as here, the statute requires threejudge review of an entire \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe single-judge court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to dispose of non-justiciable challenges to BCRA finds further support from\\nits important role as a gatekeeper.

To\\nrecap, Senator Cruz loaned his campaign $10,000 more\\nthan he could legally be repaid using post-election contributions. Compl. \\xc2\\xb6 28. Believing that he had a right\\nbe repaid with such funds, he declined to pay himself\\nback with available pre-election funds and instead used\\nthose funds to pay back other creditors. Id. \\xc2\\xb6 29. After the 20-day period had elapsed, Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign repaid him the $250,000 maximum using post-election contributions, but it is legally barred from paying\\nhim back the $10,000 balance. Id. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 30-32.\\nAs a consequence of all this, Senator Cruz is still\\nowed $10,000, id. \\xc2\\xb6 32, which is plainly a cognizable injury. Indeed, any financial loss\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if only a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdollar\\nor two\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94is ordinarily a cognizable injury for standing\\npurposes. See Sprint Commc\\xe2\\x80\\x99ns Co., L.P. v. APCC\\nServs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 289 (2008). That injury is\\ncaused by the Loan Repayment Limit, because the Cruz\\nCommittee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inability to repay the $10,000 balance is due\\nto the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restrictions on the amount of post-election\\ncontributions a campaign can use to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloans. And the injury would be redressed by a favorable\\ncourt decision, because, if a three-judge court were to\\nstrike down the Loan Repayment Limit, the Cruz Committee would solicit additional post-election contributions to pay off Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans. See Compl. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 3233. Senator Cruz has therefore met his burden of plausibly alleging each of the three elements of standing. 3\\n\\nBecause Senator Cruz has standing due to his financial injury,\\nthe court does not address Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 other theories of standing.\\nSee Ams. for Safe Access v. Drug Enf \\xe2\\x80\\x99t Admin., 706 F.3d 438, 443\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c52a\\nThe FEC nevertheless argues that Senator Cruz\\nlacks standing because, it says, the Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury is\\nself-inflicted. A self-inflicted harm is neither a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccognizable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Article III injury, nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfairly traceable to the\\ndefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenged conduct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Family Planning & Reprod.

By choosing not to make a modest loan payment\\nof $10,000 using pre-election funds, the FEC contends,\\nPlaintiffs voluntarily chose to subject Senator Cruz to\\nan injury under Option 2. Defs.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mot. at 16-17.\\nThe flaw in the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument is that it would require Senator Cruz to avoid an injury by subjecting himself to the very framework he alleges is unconstitutional.\\nFor standing purposes, the court must accept as valid\\nthe merits of Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claim, see re U.S. Office of Pers.\\nMgmt. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 54 (D.C.\\nCir. 2019), meaning the court must assume that the\\nLoan Repayment Limit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s restriction on the amount of\\npost-election contributions a campaign committee can\\nuse to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pre-election loans unconstitutionally burdens free speech, see Compl. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 3, 35-41.\\nThe corollary of this is that Plaintiffs would have the\\nright to repay Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans in full using postelection contributions. Obligating Plaintiffs to avoid\\nthe Senator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury by repaying at least a portion of the\\nloans using pre-election contributions would therefore\\nrequire Senator Cruz to forego exercising a right that\\nthe court must assume he has, and subject him to the\\nvery framework that ostensibly unconstitutionally burdens his free speech.\\nThis principle animated the D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent decision in Libertarian National Committee, Inc. v. FEC,\\nwhere the court rejected an argument that a political\\ncommittee had caused its own injury by refusing to subject itself to the statutory requirement it was challenging. 924 F.3d 533, 536 (D.C. Cir. 2019). In that case,\\n\\n\\x0c55a\\na deceased member of the Libertarian Party had bequeathed more than $200,000 to the Libertarian National Committee (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLNC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\xe2\\x80\\x94well above the annual contribution limit of $33,400. Id. at 536. The LNC could\\nhave accepted the bequest all at once by placing $33,400\\nin its general treasury and the rest in segregated accounts that limited the purposes for which the funds\\ncould be spent, but the committee believed it had a First\\nAmendment right to receive the full bequest with no\\nstrings attached. Id. at 538. Rather than accept the\\nmoney into spending-limited accounts, the LNC deposited the money into escrow, which limited its ability to\\nuse the money for expressive purposes. See id. at 53839. The court rejected the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument that the\\nLNC inflicted its own injury by failing to accept the entire bequest into segregated accounts, reasoning that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe LNC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury stems not from its inability to accept\\nthe entire bequest immediately (which it could have\\ndone), but rather from the committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inability to accept immediately the entire bequest for general expressive purposes (which FECA prohibits).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 538\\n(cleaned up). Thus, as with this case, the LNC had no\\nobligation to avoid its injury by subjecting itself to the\\nvery statutory requirement it claimed to be unconstitutional.\\nNone of the cases the FEC cites supports the notion\\nthat to avoid causing her own injury a plaintiff must\\ndo the very thing she claims she has a right not to do.\\nFor instance, in Gonzalez, the D.C. Circuit held that a\\nplaintiff lacked standing where its purported injury\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nuncertainty as to how to comply with a purportedly conflicting statute and regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x94could have easily been\\n\\n\\x0c56a\\nresolved by asking the relevant agency to clarify its regulations. 468 F.3d at 831. The plaintiff was not challenging the requirement that it seek clarification, however. Thus, unlike Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injury here, the Gonzalez\\nplaintiff \\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceasy means for alleviating the alleged [injury],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id., did not require it to comply with a legal requirement it was challenging. Likewise, in Huron v.\\nBerry, the court held that a family lacked standing to\\nchallenge the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval of certain\\nhealth insurance plans for federal employees after the\\nfamily switched to a plan that lacked medical coverage\\nthe father needed. 12 F. Supp. 3d 46, 47 (D.D.C. 2013).\\nThe family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury was self-inflicted, the court held, because they had chosen to enroll in a plan that lacked the\\nneeded coverage notwithstanding the fact that there\\nwere at least seven other federal plans that offered such\\ncoverage. Id. at 52-53. The family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision not to\\nenroll in those other plans was based purely on their\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cown economic self-interest,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 53; the family did not\\nallege, as Plaintiffs allege here, that they had a constitutional right to enroll in the plan that lacked coverage,\\nor that enrolling in any of the other plans would violate\\ntheir rights.\\nThe FEC makes much of the D.C.

As discussed,\\nMcConnell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holding that the back door regulatory challenges raised\\nby the plaintiffs on appeal were not appropriately raised in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthis facial challenge to BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was confined to the facts of that case; the\\nstatement had nothing to do with whether a three-judge court has\\nsupplemental jurisdiction to hear non-constitutional claims alongside a BCRA claim.\\n6\\n\\n\\x0c63a\\nthat a constitutional challenge to FECA, brought alongside a constitutional challenge to BCRA, would have to\\nbe heard simultaneously by the D.C. Circuit and a threejudge district court. The FEC misconstrues the nature of supplemental jurisdiction, however. Supplemental jurisdiction is not required when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpressly provided otherwise by Federal statute,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere are\\nother compelling reasons for declining jurisdiction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1367(a), (c)(4). These exceptions would\\nsurely excuse a three-judge court from exercising supplemental jurisdiction over claims for which the D.C.\\nCircuit had exclusive jurisdiction. 7\\nFinally, the FEC argues that supplemental jurisdiction is inappropriate because Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulatory\\nclaims are insufficiently related to their constitutional\\nclaims. See Defs.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 10-11. That argument is\\ndubious, as the challenged regulations implement Section 304 of BCRA. In any event, the issue is one better\\nleft for the three-judge panel to resolve in the discretionary exercise of its supplemental jurisdiction.\\nThat said, this potential statutory conflict illuminates why Plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 alternate theory\\xe2\\x80\\x94that any claim that is part of an \\xe2\\x80\\x9caction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that\\nincludes a constitutional challenge to BCRA challenge must be\\nheard by the three-judge court, see Pls.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Reply at 29-32\\xe2\\x80\\x94is incorrect.\\nSuch mandatory three-judge jurisdiction over all claims accompanying a BCRA constitutional claim\\xe2\\x80\\x94even claims utterly unrelated to\\nBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x94would directly conflict with 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30110, see Wagner\\nv.

In particular, IFS has substantial experience litigating challenges to political speech restrictions, and it represents\\nindividuals and civil society organizations, pro bono, in\\ncases raising First Amendment objections to the regulation of core political activity.\\n---------------------------------\\xe2\\x99\\xa6---------------------------------\\n\\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\\nThis appeal presents the Court with an opportunity to remind an important audience beyond the\\nparties to the case, through a brief memorandum\\nopinion accompanying summary affirmance, of two\\nfundamental principles for campaign finance. First,\\nalthough the distinction between \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontributions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpenditures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in campaign finance law may be a helpful construct, it is not an end in itself; rather, a court\\nmust maintain its focus on the real world effect of\\n1\\n\\nPursuant to Supreme Court Rule 37.6, counsel for amicus\\ncuriae certifies that no counsel for a party authored this brief in\\nwhole or in part, and no party or counsel for a party, or any other\\nperson besides amicus curiae, its members, or its counsel made a\\nmonetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of this brief. All parties participating in this litigation\\nhave received over ten days\\xe2\\x80\\x99 notice of the filing of this brief, and\\nhave granted written consent to the filing of this brief directly to\\ncounsel for amicus curiae.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nthe restriction at issue on political speech. Second, although less rigorous than strict scrutiny, closely drawn\\nscrutiny requires that a court assiduously vet the justifications and evidence offered by the government in\\nsupport of limits on campaign contributions.\\nThese two fundamental principles were made\\nmanifest by the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision striking down\\nthe loan repayment limitation (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLoan Repayment\\nLimit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) contained in 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j), Section 304\\nof the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. The\\ndecision should be summarily affirmed, and plenary\\nconsideration is not warranted.\\nHowever, the audience for a summary affirmance\\nwith no explanation whatsoever would likely be limited to the parties only. A brief memorandum opinion\\nreiterating one or both of the two fundamental principles will ensure that the decision holds clear precedential value for lower courts, candidates, legislators, and\\nothers who are potential parties or otherwise interested in campaign finance law. This, in turn, will reduce the possibility of needless direct appeals to this\\nCourt in the future.\\n---------------------------------\\xe2\\x99\\xa6---------------------------------\\n\\nARGUMENT\\nI.\\n\\nA brief explanation of the grounds for summary affirmance will benefit lower courts,\\npotential litigants, and the public.\\n\\nThe Loan Repayment Limit was, as the District\\nCourt noted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca somewhat obscure campaign finance\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nrestriction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 6a. In addition, appellant the Federal\\nElection Commission (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFEC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) raises issues that are\\ninsubstantial, and that neither implicate a circuit conflict, Virginia v. American Booksellers Ass\\xe2\\x80\\x99n, 484 U.S.\\n383, 392 (1988), nor raise any noteworthy issue, American Commercial Lines, Inc. v. Louisville & N. R. Co.,\\n392 U.S. 571, 574 (1968). Thus, full plenary review by\\nthis Court of the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision is not warranted, and summary affirmance is appropriate. At\\nthe same time, a brief explanation from this Court of\\nits reasons for affirming will benefit lower courts, future litigants, and others.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen we summarily affirm, without opinion . . .\\nwe affirm the judgment but not necessarily the reasoning by which it was reached.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mandel v. Bradley, 432\\nU.S. 173, 176 (1977) (citation omitted). Summary affirmances carry some weight, but \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey are not of the\\nsame precedential value as would be an opinion of this\\nCourt treating the question on the merits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Edelman v.\\nJordan, 415 U.S. 651, 671 (1974). Thus, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]n unexplicated summary affirmance settles the issues for the\\nparties,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but may not provide much guidance to anyone\\nelse. Mandel, 432 U.S. at 176 (citation omitted). Furthermore, summary affirmances must be read with\\ncare because they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextend only to \\xe2\\x80\\x98the precise issues\\npresented and necessarily decided\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the actions they\\naffirm. Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S.\\n490, 499 (1981) (quoting Mandel, 432 U.S. at 176).\\nHere, the District Court produced a well-reasoned\\ndecision that exemplifies proper application of the\\nclosely drawn scrutiny test. However, the decision\\nand, more importantly, its reasoning, will receive less\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nweight from nonparties if it is summarily affirmed\\nwithout at least some discussion. Mandel, 432 U.S. at\\n176 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause a summary affirmance is an affirmance\\nof the judgment only, the rationale of the affirmance\\nmay not be gleaned solely from the opinion below.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nTo offer clear guidance to others besides the parties, and to avoid the risk of confusing that broader\\naudience, some explication is appropriate. A short\\nmemorandum opinion could identify the primary basis\\nfor affirming the District Court or include a case cite\\nor two signaling which precedent dictated the outcome,\\nthereby helping to resolve (and perhaps preempt) future campaign finance litigation. In addition, a brief\\nopinion would help to minimize the possibility for\\nany disconnect between campaign finance law as announced by this Court and as applied by lower courts,\\nas the Court has observed with regard to other constitutional rights. See, e.g., New York State Rifle & Pistol\\nAss\\xe2\\x80\\x99n v. City of New York, 140 S. Ct. 1525, 1527 (2020)\\n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (expressing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconcern that\\nsome federal and state courts may not be properly applying Heller and MacDonald\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); id. at 1544 (Alito, J.,\\ndissenting) (same); see also Thompson v. Hebdon, 140\\nS. Ct. 348, 350 & n.* (2019) (per curiam) (vacating and\\nremanding where appeals court \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeclined to apply\\xe2\\x80\\x9d recent Supreme Court precedent for campaign finance\\nrestrictions).\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nII.\\n\\nThis Court should caution against overreliance on Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s soft distinctions and\\nemphasize that a court must focus primarily on the real world effect on political\\nspeech.\\n\\nSince Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) (per curiam), campaign finance caselaw has relied heavily on\\nthat decision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinction between contributions and\\nexpenditures, and the differences in how restrictions\\non each regulatory target are treated under the First\\nAmendment. Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinctions may serve as useful, heuristic tools for the ultimate purpose of determining when campaign finance restrictions overcome\\nthe heavy presumption in favor of free political speech.\\nBut the distinctions are not an end in themselves, and\\nthey can even lead to confusion at times. Thus, courts\\nshould guard against an overreliance on them.\\nBuckley constructed an elaborate theory based on\\nthe notion that the speech interests inherent in contributions were weaker than those in expenditures, because contributions were only symbolic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeech by\\nproxy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the contributor was merely expressing his\\nor her political support; a specific dollar limit did not\\nprevent the contributor from achieving this form of expression. Buckley, 424 U.S. at 20-21. This distinction\\nhas been criticized, however, see, e.g., McCutcheon v.\\nFEC, 572 U.S. 185, 228-29 (2014) (Thomas, J., concurring), and its shortcomings are readily apparent.\\nFor example, the Loan Repayment Limit did in\\nfact affect political speech, which should be the bottom\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nline in any constitutional analysis. Contributions to a\\npolitical campaign promote more expenditures by that\\ncampaign, which results in more political speech. App.\\n19a (acknowledging the \\xe2\\x80\\x9creality that contributions and\\nexpenditures are often \\xe2\\x80\\x98two sides of the same First\\nAmendment coin\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (quoting Buckley, 424 U.S. at 241\\n(Burger, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in\\npart)). The District Court recognized that, associational rights aside, laws that disincentivize candidates\\nfrom loaning money to their campaigns will result in\\nless political speech. App. 19a; see also Republican\\nNat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Comm. v. FEC, 698 F. Supp. 2d 150, 156 (D.D.C.)\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be sure, every limit on contributions logically reduces the total amount that the recipient of the contributions otherwise could spend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), aff \\xe2\\x80\\x99d without opn.,\\n561 U.S. 1040 (2010). Simply because a restriction may\\nreduce political speech only indirectly, like the Loan\\nRepayment Limit did, does not mean that rigorous\\nFirst Amendment scrutiny is not required.\\nThe District Court acknowledged the limitations\\nof Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinctions and focused \\xe2\\x80\\x9con speech interests more generally.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See App. 12a. It recognized that\\nin more recent decisions like McCutcheon and Davis v.\\nFEC, 554 U.S. 724 (2008), this Court \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas emphasized\\nthe central question of whether and how a challenged\\nregulation burdens political speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 13a.\\nGiven the First Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blunt text (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress shall make no law . . . \\xe2\\x80\\x9d), the constitutionality of\\nrestrictions on political speech should not turn entirely\\non intricate judicial constructs like multifactor analyses\\nor balancing tests. See FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life,\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nInc., 551 U.S. 449, 469 (2007) (citation omitted) (standard of review for challenge to free speech restriction\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust eschew \\xe2\\x80\\x98the open-ended rough-and-tumble of\\nfactors,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which \\xe2\\x80\\x98invit[es] complex argument in a trial\\ncourt and a virtually inevitable appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The First\\nAmendment provides the lodestar for courts to follow\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely, political speech must be largely unfettered\\nby regulation \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and any analysis must begin with that\\npremise before delving into whether the challenged\\nregulation relates to contributions or expenditures.\\nLastly, emphasizing the primacy of a regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\neffect on political speech over difficult distinctions between contributions and expenditures helps to simplify the analysis. As with McCutcheon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confirmation\\nthat actual quid pro quo corruption or its appearance\\nis the sole interest that justifies contribution limits\\nconsistent with the First Amendment, McCutcheon,\\n572 U.S. at 207-08, clarifying the complex law of campaign finance whenever feasible will help to improve\\nits understanding by lower courts, potential litigants,\\npolitical candidates, and legislators.\\nIII. A brief opinion from this Court will confirm\\nthe rigorousness of closely drawn scrutiny,\\nas reflected in the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision.\\nBuckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s distinction between expenditures and\\ncontributions affects whether a regulation is subject to\\nstrict or closely drawn scrutiny, and the application of\\nthose standards can complicate the First Amendment\\nanalysis further. The District Court, however, avoided\\n\\n\\x0c8\\ngetting lost in the weeds by applying closely drawn\\nscrutiny in a thorough and thoughtful manner with its\\nprimary focus on the Loan Repayment Limitation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actual effect on political speech. Its decision should serve\\nas a model for other courts presented with restrictions\\non contributions.\\nIndeed, the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision stands in\\nuseful contrast to examples of the standard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s misapplication. The D.C. Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision in Libertarian Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l\\nComm., Inc. v. FEC (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLNC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), 924 F.3d 533 (D.C. Cir.)\\n(en banc), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 569 (2019), provides\\none such example. In LNC, the court held that, inter\\nalia, a two-tiered contribution scheme created by the\\nFederal Election Campaign Act \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which set separate\\nlimits on annual contributions to political parties for\\ngeneral purposes and for specified purposes (e.g., presidential nominating conventions), which were to be\\nkept segregated \\xe2\\x80\\x93 did not violate the First Amendment\\nbecause the limits were closely drawn to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anticorruption interest. However, two forceful\\ndissents raised serious questions about the majority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\napplication of closely drawn scrutiny.\\nDissenting in part, Judge Griffith wrote that to\\nshow alleged corruption-related differences between\\ngeneral and segregated contributions justifying the\\nseparate limits, the government had presented only\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9can ambivalent record.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 554 (citing McCutcheon,\\n572 U.S. at 217). For example, the majority had drawn\\ninferences in favor of the government that lacked evidentiary support and had relied on self-serving assertions in the legislative history by representatives of the\\n\\n\\x0c9\\ntwo major parties. Id. at 554-55. Thus, he concluded,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe government has not carried its burden of showing\\nthat the two-tiered scheme is closely drawn to serve\\nanticorruption interests.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 556.\\nIn a separate partial dissent, Judge Katsas (joined\\nby Judge Henderson) observed that in McCutcheon,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe plurality sought to minimize the differences between strict and closely drawn scrutiny . . . in the face\\nof a continuing call for strict scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of contribution\\nlimits by several Justices dating back to Buckley itself. Id. at 559 (citations omitted). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGiven this longstanding debate over whether closely drawn scrutiny\\nsets the bar too low, it is quite a stretch to posit that,\\nhere, it sets the bar too high,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the government argued. Id.\\nBoth dissents closely followed McCutcheon, with\\nJudge Griffith emphasizing the need for close scrutiny\\nof the evidence presented to support restrictions on\\npolitical speech, and Judge Katsas pointing out that\\ncontribution limits were not subject to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless-thanintermediate scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and, if anything, closely drawn\\nscrutiny was similar in rigor to strict scrutiny, id.\\nAnother example of the closely drawn standard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nmisapplication comes from Lair v. Motl, 873 F.3d 1170\\n(9th Cir. 2017), where the court held that Montana\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncampaign contribution limits were closely drawn to\\nfurther the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in preventing quid pro quo\\ncorruption.2 Dissenting, Judge Bea explained that the\\n2\\n\\nNotably, the Lair majority stated repeatedly that to survive closely drawn scrutiny, the statutory limit need only be\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nmajority failed to recognize that this Court had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnarrowed what can constitute a valid important state interest . . . to only the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest in eliminating or\\nreducing quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 1188. Thus, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he mere prevention of influence\\non legislators by contributors is now not a valid important state interest that could justify campaign contribution limits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. (citations omitted) (emphasis\\noriginal). Further, on close examination of the record,\\nJudge Bea found no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cevidence of exchanges of dollars\\nfor political favors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 much less for any actions contrary\\nto legislators\\xe2\\x80\\x99 obligations of office \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or any reason to\\nbelieve the appearance of such exchanges will develop\\nin the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1189. The government had shown\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing more than the trading of influence and access,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which were not sufficient government interests\\nand, in fact, were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccritical mechanisms through which\\nour political system responds to the needs of constituents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nThe dissents in LNC and Lair took a hard, cleareyed look at whether the government had carried its\\nevidentiary burden, and did not resort to generalized\\nconcerns about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoney in politics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunequal electoral playing fields.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The dissents reflect the high level\\nof scrutiny that must be employed in determining\\nwhether restrictions on campaign contributions violate the First Amendment rights of donors or recipients.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cadequately tailored\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to fit the asserted governmental interest. Id.\\nat 1172, 1176, 1187.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nThis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s clarification that combating quid pro\\nquo corruption or its appearance is the only governmental interest that can justify limits on political\\nspeech, McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 207-08, may have\\nbeen closely drawn scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most significant development since Buckley first announced it. Hewing closely\\nto McCutcheon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach, App. 10a, the District Court\\nmaintained its focus on that interest, and thus its decision is more in keeping with recent precedent than\\nthe majorities in LNC and Lair. Lower courts could use\\nsome guidance pointing out that the decision below\\nrepresents the correct approach to closely drawn\\nscrutiny. A brief memorandum opinion would also\\nminimize the risk of confusion that sometimes arises\\nsurrounding the precedential value to be accorded an\\nunexplicated summary affirmance. See, e.g., Ga. State\\nConf. of NAACP v. Georgia, 269 F. Supp. 3d 1266, 127879 n.7 (N.D. Ga. 2017) (citing cases) (noting that in redistricting challenges, three-judge district courts may\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cresult[ ] in the slow and incomplete development of a\\ncohesive body of law in voting rights cases,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that\\nsummary affirmances may leave \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgaps where we have\\nlittle or incomplete guidance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe District Court recognized that loans by candidates to their own campaigns are a form of selffinancing, and the First Amendment allows candidates\\nto self-finance without monetary limits. App. 7a. As in\\nDavis, any governmental interest in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleveling the playing field\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between wealthier candidates who can more\\neasily lend to their campaigns and their less wealthy\\nopponents did not justify the Loan Repayment Limit.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\nThis Court has \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoundly rejected a cap on a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexpenditure of personal funds to finance campaign\\nspeech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, 554 U.S. at 738; see also Ariz.

In addition, unlike campaign contributions, gifts have nothing to do with activity that is encouraged by the First\\nAmendment \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely, promoting political speech in\\nthe electoral process.\\nThe District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review of the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proffered\\nevidence illustrates the proper application of the\\nclosely drawn scrutiny standard.

For example,\\nthe District Court noted that although many states\\nimpose no loan repayment limits whatsoever, the FEC\\ncould not identify a single instance of quid pro quo\\ncorruption due to a lack of limits in those states. App.,\\n23a-24a & n.7. The absence of examples of the corruption warned of by the FEC severely undermined its\\nposition. See McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 209 n.7 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe\\nGovernment presents no evidence concerning the circumvention of base limits from the 30 states with base\\nlimits but no aggregate limits.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThin evidence like that presented by the FEC in\\nsupport of the Loan Repayment Limits \\xe2\\x80\\x93 e.g., academic\\narticles that remain ambiguous on the factual issue\\nrelevant to campaign finance law, media conjecture,\\nand self-serving polls commissioned by the government, App. 27a-28a \\xe2\\x80\\x93 cannot hold up under close\\nscrutiny. Similarly, although courts \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextend[ ] a measure of deference to the judgment of the legislative\\nbody that enacted the law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d limiting contributions,\\nDavis, 554 U.S. at 737, they should not remain supine\\nin the face of the legislative record, and have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno alternative to the exercise of independent judicial judgment as a statute reaches [the] outer limits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\npermissible regulation, Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S.\\n230, 249 (2006); see also Ariz. Free Enter.

App. 27a-28a.\\nAs the District Court recognized, base limits on\\ncontributions already exist to prevent quid pro quo corruption. App. 34a. Any additional layer of contribution\\nlimits on top of base limits must be justified with a separate showing of how it \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98serve[s] the interest in preventing the appearance or actuality of corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n(quoting Holmes v. FEC, 875 F.3d 1153, 1161 (D.C. Cir.\\n2017) (en banc)) (cleaned up). In a brief memorandum\\ndecision, this Court should confirm that McCutcheon\\nrequires additional justification for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprophylaxis upon\\nprophylaxis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d regulations like the Loan Repayment\\nLimit. App. 34a & n.10.\\nClosely drawn scrutiny may be somewhat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cless\\nrigorous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d relative to strict scrutiny, see McConnell v.\\nFEC, 540 U.S. 93, 137 (2003), but the District Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision illustrates that proper judicial review of contribution limits is nonetheless extremely rigorous as\\nan objective matter. Although this Court has described\\nintermediate scrutiny generally as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmidway between\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x98strict scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demanded for content-based regulation of speech and the \\xe2\\x80\\x98rational basis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standard that\\nis applied . . . to government regulation of nonspeech\\nactivities,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Madsen v. Women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Health Center, 512 U.S.\\n753, 796 (1994), closely drawn scrutiny specifically\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nresembles strict scrutiny much more closely than mere\\nrational basis review. Both strict and closely drawn\\nscrutiny can only be justified by a governmental interest in preventing quid pro quo corruption, and both\\nturn on the fact-intensive issue of whether a restriction\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the asserted risk. By contrast, a court need not\\neven look to the evidentiary record for rational basis\\nreview. See FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508\\nU.S. 307, 315 (1993) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9ca legislative choice is not subject\\nto courtroom factfinding and may be based on rational\\nspeculation unsupported by evidence or empirical\\ndata\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nIn fact, McCutcheon hinted that the boundaries\\nbetween the standards of review for campaign finance\\nwere somewhat permeable:\\n[R]egardless whether we apply strict scrutiny\\nor Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d test, we must assess the fit between the stated governmental\\nobjective and the means selected to achieve\\nthat objective. Or to put it another way, if a\\nlaw that restricts political speech does not\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cavoid unnecessary abridgment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of First\\nAmendment rights, it cannot survive \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigorous\\xe2\\x80\\x9d review.\\n572 U.S. at 199 (citations omitted). In fact, tiered levels\\nof means-end scrutiny may not be appropriate for determining whether any fundamental constitutional\\nrights have been violated. See Whole Woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Health\\nv. Hellerstedt, 136 S. Ct. 2292, 2328 (2016) (Thomas, J.,\\ndissenting) (recognizing \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctendency [of courts] to relax\\n\\n\\x0c16\\npurportedly higher standards of review for lesspreferred rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.

State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 124\\n(1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring) (strict scrutiny \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas\\nno real or legitimate place when the Court considers\\nthe straightforward question [of ] whether the State\\nmay enact a burdensome [content-based speech] restriction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The Constitution itself, of course, sets forth\\nno standards of review and, if pushed too hard, the different levels of campaign finance scrutiny collapse onto\\nthemselves. A more categorical approach that focuses\\non the scope of the right to political speech and compares it to the challenged restriction, may be warranted.\\nAlthough any change in this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign finance jurisprudence would require plenary consideration, which is not warranted here, summary affirmance\\nwith a brief memorandum opinion offers a relatively\\npainless way to provide needed direction beyond the\\nparties to this case.

Valeo,\\n424 U.S. 1, 27 (1976) (per curiam), it was concerned\\nabout the possibility that private contributions would\\nbe given to candidate campaigns in exchange for eventual official favors.\\nIn this case, however, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in question is not\\na typical campaign contribution made to a federal\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authorized committee to support an active\\n1\\n\\nOn July 28, 2021, pursuant to Rule 37.2(a), counsel for\\namicus curiae informed the parties of its intent to file an amicus\\nbrief, nine days before the filing date of August 6. All parties consented in writing to CLC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participation in this case. This brief\\nwas not authored in whole or in part by counsel for any party. No\\nperson or entity other than amicus or its counsel made a monetary contribution to this brief \\xe2\\x80\\x99s preparation or submission.\\n\\n\\x0c2\\ncampaign; instead, it is money solicited after the\\nelection has occurred for the sole purpose of repaying\\nthe candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal campaign loans\\xe2\\x80\\x94and is thus\\nmoney that goes right back into the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket.\\nSee 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j) (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cloan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe risk of corruption posed by what is functionally a personal \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgift\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to a candidate is self-evident.\\nIndeed, the immediate personal financial benefits provided by such a post-election contribution are even\\nmore likely to lead to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblatant and specific attempts\\nof those with money to influence governmental action,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBuckley, 424 U.S. at 28, than are the more typical\\ncontributions to campaign treasuries addressed in\\nBuckley.\\nNonetheless, the district court reviewed the loanrepayment limit challenged here as if its anti-corruption purpose were novel, disregarding the myriad\\nlongstanding laws and rules regulating contributions\\nand gifts to candidates and officeholders, many of\\nwhich have been reviewed and upheld by this Court.\\nThe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s blinkered review resulted in\\ntwo principal errors.\\nFirst, in laboring to wedge this unique limit into\\nthe existing taxonomy of campaign finance law, the\\nlower court misunderstood how the limit functioned\\nand consequently overstated the First Amendment\\nburdens it posed. Properly understood, the limit\\ndoes not regulate candidate self-financing or restrict\\ncampaign contributions; instead, it simply limits a\\n\\n\\x0c3\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accrual of personal financial benefits in the\\npost-election period.\\nThe lower court also overlooked a key fact in this\\ncase: Ted Cruz for Senate (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCruz campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) did\\nnot actually use post-election contributions to repay\\nSenator Cruz for his $260,000 loan to the campaign.\\nInstead, the campaign used pre-election contributions\\nto repay $250,000 of this loan, and thus was not constrained with respect to the type of contributions it\\ncould apply to the remaining $10,000 loan balance.\\nThis material error represents a clear defect in the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s findings with respect to appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standing and underscores the tenuous nature of the alleged\\nburden. Summary reversal of the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and remand with instructions to dismiss is warranted on this ground alone.\\nSecond, the district court erred in presuming that\\nthe anti-corruption objectives of the loan-repayment\\nlimit were somehow novel or untested\\xe2\\x80\\x94instead, the\\nimportance of this governmental interest is well-established and has been repeatedly recognized as justifying\\na range of analogous campaign contribution limits and\\ngift rules. To be sure, the government still bears the\\nburden of demonstrating that the challenged law is\\nwell-tailored to advance this \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate and compelling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d governmental interest, FEC v. Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Conservative\\nPAC, 470 U.S. 480, 496 (1985), but the sufficiency or\\nweight of the interest \\xe2\\x80\\x9chas never been doubted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FEC\\nv.

Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 788, n.26\\n(1978)).\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nAs a consequence of this error, the lower court held\\nappellant Federal Election Commission (FEC or Commission) to an unduly stringent standard in terms of\\nthe evidence needed to substantiate its governmental\\ninterest, and then rejected the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proffered evidence without adequate explanation or any discernable standard governing its review.

Shrink Mo. Gov\\xe2\\x80\\x99t PAC, 528 U.S.\\n377, 391 (2000). It is hardly novel or implausible to believe that a post-election contribution that effectively\\ngoes straight into a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket may create a\\nrisk of corruption. The government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s burden should\\nhave been correspondingly light.\\nNor did the lower court pay appropriate deference\\nto Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment about the dangers of postelection fundraising\\xe2\\x80\\x94although this subject is uniquely\\nwithin the legislature\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expertise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe \\xe2\\x80\\x98must accord\\nsubstantial deference to the predictive judgments of\\nCongress,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 particularly when, as here, those predictions are so firmly rooted in relevant history and common sense.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McConnell, 540 U.S. at 165 (quoting\\nTurner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. 622, 665\\n(1994) (plurality opinion)). Here, Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprediction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that post-election contributions that directly\\nand personally enrich candidates pose a particularly\\nacute threat of corruption aligns both with common\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nsense and the record in this case. The lower court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\njudgment should be summarily reversed.\\n---------------------------------\\xe2\\x99\\xa6---------------------------------\\n\\nARGUMENT\\nI.\\n\\nThe Lower Court Misconstrued and Overstated the First Amendment Burdens Presented by the Loan-Repayment Limit.\\nA. The challenged law functions as a limit\\non personal gifts aggregating over\\n$250,000, not as a limit on candidate\\ncampaign spending.\\n\\nAt issue here is Section 304 of the Bipartisan\\nCampaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), which provides\\nthat a federal candidate may use up to $250,000 in\\ncontributions raised after the date of an election to\\nrepay the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outstanding personal loans incurred during the campaign. 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j). The\\nlaw places no limit on the amount of funds raised prior\\nto the election that can be used to repay the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloans. 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(1). FEC regulations further\\nprovide that a campaign committee has 20 days after\\nthe election during which it can use pre-election funds\\nto pay back the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans without\\nlimitation. Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(c)(1).\\nThe district court held that the loan-repayment\\nlimit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimposes a \\xe2\\x80\\x98drag\\xe2\\x80\\x99 on the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s First Amendment activity by discouraging the personal financing of\\ncampaign speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 15a (citing Davis v. FEC, 554\\nU.S. 724, 739 (2008)). But that ignores how the\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nprovision actually operates\\xe2\\x80\\x94it limits post-election personal gifts, not a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to self-finance or\\nspeak.\\nWhen the Court in McConnell analyzed BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nban on spending so-called \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoft money,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the Court recognized that this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmechanism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d functioned no differently from a contribution limit, and therefore subjected\\nwhat appeared to be a spending limit to the same level\\nof scrutiny as that applied to contribution limits. 540\\nU.S. at 138-39. Here, however, the lower court failed to\\nappreciate that the loan-repayment limit actually\\nfunctions as a gift limit, thus misconstruing the burden it imposes and the evidence necessary to sustain\\nit.\\nThe repayment limit does not even indirectly\\nlimit the amount of personal funds a candidate can\\nspend or loan to his campaign. It limits neither the\\nexpenditures a campaign committee may make, contra Buckley, 424 U.S. at 54 (striking down \\xe2\\x80\\x9climitations\\non overall campaign expenditures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by federal candidates), nor the amount of personal funds a candidate\\ncan spend or loan to his campaign, contra id. at 51-52\\n(striking down limits on expenditures by a candidate\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom his personal funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). It also imposes no limit on\\nthe amount of the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loans that a\\ncampaign can repay using contributions made on or\\nbefore election day, see 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(b)(1). Functionally, the provision just prescribes when funds\\nmust be raised by the campaign committee for the\\npurposes of loan repayment\\xe2\\x80\\x94if they are raised after\\nthe election, the provision acts as a $250,000 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgift\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nlimit on contributions that candidates receive for their\\npersonal use.\\nNor is the loan-repayment limit analogous to the\\nlaws considered in Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724 (2008),\\nor Arizona Free Enterprise Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Freedom Club PAC\\nv. Bennett, 564 U.S. 721 (2011). The statutes at issue\\nthere provided for an immediate and asymmetric\\nchange in the operative campaign rules and imposed\\nconcrete fundraising disadvantages on self-financing\\ncandidates when their spending exceeded certain\\namounts. For example, the Millionaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amendment\\nreviewed in Davis tripled the base contribution limits\\nfor a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opponent if the candidate spent over\\na threshold amount of personal funds on the campaign.\\n554 U.S. at 728. This imposition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9casymmetrical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d limits represented \\xe2\\x80\\x9can unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises [the] First Amendment\\nright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to self-finance. Id. at 739, 741. Here, by contrast,\\nthe loan-repayment limit is a provision of general applicability, creating a single regime governing the repayment of candidate campaign loans to which all\\ncandidates are equally subject, regardless of the actions of their opponents.\\nThe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fundamental mistake was to\\nanalyze the loan-repayment limit only in terms of the\\npurpose for which the candidate ostensibly made the\\ninitial loan\\xe2\\x80\\x94to finance an election campaign, an action\\nthat indisputably receives First Amendment protection. See App. 11a-12a. But the limit does not restrict\\nthe amount or timing of candidate loans in an election;\\nit merely regulates how much candidates can repay\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nthemselves with contributions made after the election,\\nwhen there is no longer any imperative to raise funds\\nfor that campaign.\\nIn narrowly focusing on the pre-election dimensions of the transaction, the district court ignored the\\nactual purpose of the loan-repayment limit: regulating\\nthe solicitation and receipt of post-election contributions that will directly accrue to the financial benefit\\nof the candidate. If, for instance, a campaign raises\\n$500,000 after the election to repay personal loans received from the candidate, that half-million dollars will\\nbe pocketed by the candidate.\\nThe loan-repayment limit therefore does not operate as a restriction on candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 freedom to selffinance their campaigns, including through personal\\nloans. Instead, the limit serves simply as a gift rule,\\nrestricting a particular type of fundraising that directly and personally enriches candidates.\\nB. The district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standing analysis relied on a material error.\\nThe negligible burdens implicated by the loanrepayment limit are borne out in the facts of this case.\\nIndeed, as the Commission explains, the district court\\ngreatly overstated the law\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effects on Senator Cruz because its analysis relied on a factual misapprehension\\nconcerning the repayment of his loan.\\nAs the Commission highlights, the single-judge\\ndistrict court denied the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion to dismiss and\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nfound that appellees had established standing only\\nafter crediting the allegation in their complaint that\\nthe Cruz campaign had used post-election funds to repay $250,000 of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $260,000 loan to his\\ncampaign. Jurisdictional Statement (J.S.) 9-10. But\\nthis understanding of the facts was incorrect. Discovery preceding summary judgment revealed that the\\n$250,000 had instead been repaid with pre-election\\ncontributions. Id. The loan-repayment limit thus did\\nnot restrict the type of contributions that could be used\\nto repay the outstanding $10,000 or impose any other\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstraint on appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 19. This\\nclear material error warrants reversal and remand\\nwith instructions to dismiss.\\nThis error also underscores the insubstantial and\\nhypothetical nature of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburden\\xe2\\x80\\x9d posited here. It\\nwas pure speculation to suppose, as the district court\\ndid, that candidates will make decisions about selffinancing based upon their options for post-election\\nloan repayment, particularly given that they have no\\nway of ascertaining ex ante how much they will raise\\neither before or after the election. Indeed, post-election\\nfundraising is well-known to be extremely challenging,\\nsee FEC Statement of Undisputed Material Facts\\n(SMF), D. Ct. Doc. 65, \\xc2\\xb6 42 (July 14, 2020); even highprofile presidential campaigns often fail to raise sufficient funds post-election to retire all of their outstanding debt. See Kitty Eisele, Presidential Campaign\\nDebt Can Linger For Decades, NPR (July 5, 2011),\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nhttps://www.npr.org/2011/07/05/137615746/presidentialcampaign-debt-can-linger-for-decades; Dave Levinthal,\\n14 presidential candidates who still owe campaign debt,\\nSalon (May 2, 2013), https://www.salon.com/2013/05/02/\\n14_presidential_candidates_who_havent_paid_for_their_\\ncampaigns_partner. The lower court had no basis to hypothesize that a candidate would reduce a pre-election\\nloan to his campaign because of a $250,000 limit on the\\nuse of post-election funds for repayment\\xe2\\x80\\x94instead of a\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s very reasonable concern that he would not\\nbe guaranteed to raise anything close to this amount\\nafter the election.\\nIndeed, Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s actions were not even consistent with the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s theory. He loaned his\\ncampaign $260,000 on the eve of the election because\\nhe could confidently predict that his campaign would\\nhave more than sufficient pre-election funds on hand\\nto repay the loan in full. He did not entrust the repayment of his loan to the vagaries of post-election fundraising. Indeed, Cruz and his campaign admitted that\\nthey only refrained from paying back the $10,000 balance with pre- or post-election contributions to preserve a test challenge to the loan-repayment limit. J.S.\\n10-11, 16. In short, appellees have yet to identify any\\ncandidates who have been deterred from self-financing\\ntheir campaigns due to the loan-repayment limit; Senator Cruz himself does not even count as one such candidate.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nII.\\n\\nLimiting Post-Election Payments that Personally Enrich Candidates Serves Demonstrated Anti-Corruption Interests that the\\nDistrict Court Failed to Credit.\\n\\nThe loan-repayment limit, like other campaign finance and ethics laws, is designed to prevent quid pro\\nquo corruption and its appearance. The intent of the\\nlaw is a matter of common sense; after an election, the\\ntypical rationales for contributing to a political campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x94to support a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s election and campaign\\nspeech\\xe2\\x80\\x94do not apply. Instead, as explained by the FEC\\nbelow, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]oney that repays a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal loan\\nafter an election effectively goes into the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npocket, and not to fund speech or speech-related activities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FEC Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J. Mot., D. Ct. Doc.\\n65, at 20 (July 14, 2020). At a minimum, post-election\\nfundraising to retire campaign debts gives rise to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\nappearance of federal candidates trading dollars for favors in the context of repayment of candidate loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 33.\\nA. The interests advanced by the challenged\\nlaw are neither novel nor implausible.\\nThe loan-repayment limit here regulates a kind of\\ntransaction that forms the heartland of most public\\ncorruption and conflict-of-interest laws\\xe2\\x80\\x94federal candidates accepting money that they can pocket for their\\nown personal benefit. Nevertheless, the lower court\\ndeemed the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s asserted anti-corruption interest\\nnovel and unfounded, and concluded that the Commission had failed to meet its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburden of demonstrating\\n\\n\\x0c12\\nthat the loan-repayment limit serves a sufficiently important interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 22a.\\nThis ruling is contrary to longstanding precedent.\\nAs the district court acknowledged, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he quantum of\\nempirical evidence needed to satisfy heightened judicial scrutiny of legislative judgments will vary up or\\ndown with the novelty and plausibility of the justification raised.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 22a (quoting Nixon, 528 U.S. at\\n391). The notion that a contribution that personally enriches a candidate might give rise to actual or apparent\\ncorruption is neither \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovel nor implausible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nixon,\\n528 U.S. at 391. The government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evidentiary burden\\naccordingly should have been light. Yet the lower court\\nrequired the government to substantiate its anticorruption interest as if working from a blank slate,\\ndivorced from four decades of campaign finance precedents repeatedly establishing that contribution restrictions further a bona fide interest in combatting\\nquid pro quo corruption and the appearance of corruption.\\nFirst, Buckley itself recognized as a matter of law\\nthat a campaign finance system reliant on private\\ncontributions created an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinherent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d problem of real or\\napparent corruption. 424 U.S. at 28 (emphasis added).\\nIf contributions to a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign treasury\\npresent an inherent risk, then it is beyond dispute that\\ncontributions to a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal funds present\\nan even greater inherent risk. Thus, there is nothing\\nnovel or implausible about setting a limit of $250,000\\non contributions given to reimburse candidates for\\ntheir loans.\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nSecond, the lower court erred in demanding that\\nthe FEC show current instances of quid pro quo corruption attributable to the use of post-election contributions to pay back personal loans. See, e.g., App. 23a\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe first observe that the FEC has not identified a\\nsingle case of actual quid pro quo corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d arising\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfrom post-election contributions to retire a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npersonal debt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). This practice has been restricted at\\nthe federal level for almost 20 years. And as this Court\\nhas recognized, the government need not produce specific \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccounterfactual\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence of quid pro quo corruption where, as here, a campaign finance restriction has\\nbeen in place for decades and its objectives are wellestablished and not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimplausible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCutcheon, 572\\nU.S. at 219 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe recognize that no data can be marshaled to capture perfectly the counterfactual world\\nin which aggregate [contribution] limits do not exist.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); see also FEC v.

But the Court has nevertheless repeatedly\\naccepted Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination, based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommon\\nsense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cample record\\xe2\\x80\\x9d compiled over time, that\\ncontribution limits are a necessary prophylactic to prevent corruption and its appearance. McConnell, 540\\nU.S. at 145.\\nThird, the lower court ignored that the loan-repayment limit operates in a broader network of campaign\\nfinance and ethics laws that collectively aim to avert\\nthe potential for corruption and self-dealing in connection with contributions, loans, and gifts given to officeholders and candidates. The notion that transferring\\nmoney or other items of value to candidates and officeholders for their personal benefit poses corruption risks\\nand should be regulated is hardly unique to this provision. The same rationale animates a range of laws,\\nfrom ethics rules regulating gifts and loans to officeholders, to FECA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal-use prohibition\\xe2\\x80\\x94reflecting\\nthe strength of Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination that providing\\n\\n\\x0c15\\ndirect financial benefits to a candidate or officeholder\\ncreates a serious and inherent risk of abuse.\\nFor example, concerns about corruption and its\\nappearance are the basis for the federal government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstrict rules limiting officials in all three branches of\\ngovernment from accepting gifts. See, e.g., 5 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 7353(a) (prohibiting members of Congress and federal officers and employees from soliciting or accepting\\nanything of value from persons doing business with\\nthe individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employing entity or whose interests\\nmay be affected by the performance of the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nofficial duties); 5 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 2635.204 (restricting federal\\nexecutive employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts of $20 or more\\nfrom persons whose interests may be affected by the\\nperformance of the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 official duties); Judicial\\nConference, Code of Conduct for United States Judges,\\nCanon 4(D)(4) (restricting federal judges\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and judicial\\nemployees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts of any value from persons with business before the court or whose interests\\nmay be substantially affected by the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s duties).

Carrigan, 564\\nU.S. 117, 122 (2011); see also, e.g., Standing Rule of the\\nSenate 35 (restricting members\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acceptance of gifts\\nworth $50 or more); House Rule 25.5 (same for House\\nmembers).\\nSpecific concerns about the conversion of a loan or\\ncampaign contribution into a personal benefit underlie\\nnot only the loan-repayment limit, but other provisions\\n\\n\\x0c16\\nof ethics and campaign finance laws. Federal ethics\\nguidance specifies that loans constitute impermissible\\ngifts to officeholders when those loans are characterized by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial terms in unusual cases\\xe2\\x80\\x9d giving rise to\\ncorruption or its appearance. See U.S. Office of Gov\\xe2\\x80\\x99t\\nEthics, Conflicts of Interest Considerations: Liabilities\\n2 (last updated June 22, 2018), https://www.oge.gov/web/\\nOGE.nsf/0/2063F6A1854A65E3852585B6005A2275/\\n$FILE/Liabilities.pdf. A similar concern about potential self-dealing underlies FECA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prohibition on federal candidates using campaign funds for their own\\npersonal benefit. 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30114(b) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA [campaign]\\ncontribution . . . shall not be converted by any person\\nto personal use.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); see also 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 113.1(g).\\nThese provisions directly advance the important\\ngovernmental interest in combatting corruption and\\nself-dealing by elected officials. So too does the loanrepayment limit. That the financial benefit here takes\\nthe form of a campaign contribution to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans does not render it less potentially corruptive. As the FEC explains, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoney that repays a\\npersonal loan after an election effectively goes into the\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket. A payment that adds to a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal wealth (and that can accordingly be\\nused for personal purposes) poses a greater threat of\\nquid pro quo corruption than a payment that merely\\nadds to a campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s treasury (and that can accordingly be used only for campaign purposes).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S. 19. The\\nloan-repayment limit seeks to eliminate this risk of\\nheightened corruption.\\n\\n\\x0c17\\nThe concerns underlying the loan-repayment\\nlimit are neither \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d nor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimplausible,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but wellestablished and in line with those animating numerous other laws designed to ferret out corruption and its\\nappearance in federal government. The district court\\nfailed to credit these concerns or accord the appropriate weight to anti-corruption interests long recognized\\nby this Court as both \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate and compelling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See\\nNat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Conservative PAC, 470 U.S. at 496; see also Buckley, 424 U.S. at 26-27.\\nB. The FEC provided ample evidence to\\nsubstantiate the anti-corruption objective of the loan-repayment limit.\\nThe lower court not only defined the universe of\\nrelevant evidence too narrowly, it also disregarded,\\nwithout justification, the ample legislative record and\\nother evidence offered by the FEC to substantiate the\\nlaw\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anti-corruption purposes. See App. 21a-30a.\\nFor instance, the lower court disregarded the legislative record materials presented by the FEC demonstrating the intent of the loan-repayment limit. See\\nSMF \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 23-27. As the FEC pointed out, the loan-repayment limit was discussed by multiple lawmakers in the\\ndeliberations on BCRA who explained that the limit\\nwas meant to address the acute risk of quid pro quo\\ncorruption arising from candidates\\xe2\\x80\\x99 post-election solicitation of contributions that directly benefit them\\nfinancially. See, e.g., id. \\xc2\\xb6 27 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[Candidates] have a\\n\\n\\x0c18\\nconstitutional right to try to buy the office, but they do\\nnot have a constitutional right to resell it. . . . [A] candidate can spend his or her own money but there would\\nbe a limit on the amount that candidate could go out\\nand raise to pay himself or herself back.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (quoting 147\\nCong. Rec. S2541 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2001) (statement\\nof Sen.

Rec. at\\nS2462 (statement of Sen. Domenici)).\\nInstead, without explanation, the lower court focused on the background to Section 319 of BCRA, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMillionaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amendment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a wholly different provision of the legislation with no identified link to the provision challenged here. App. 27a. Questioning the\\nlegislative intent behind one statutory provision by examining the history of an entirely different provision\\nconstitutes clear error.\\nThe FEC also adduced evidence of problems at the\\nstate level resulting from post-election contributions to\\nindebted candidates, pointing to investigations and\\ncorruption concerns in Ohio, Oklahoma, Kentucky, and\\nAlaska. SMF \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 73-81. In Ohio, former attorney general and now governor Mike DeWine repeatedly loaned\\nhis campaign money and then raised millions of dollars in post-election contributions to pay off that debt,\\nincluding from entities seeking\\xe2\\x80\\x94and ultimately obtaining\\xe2\\x80\\x94state contracts. See id. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 73-75. The particular largesse of contributors with something to gain\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nfrom state contracting decisions under DeWine led\\nto concerns that his debt-retirement fundraising\\nwas breeding corruption, or certainly its appearance.\\nSee, e.g., id. \\xc2\\xb6 73 (noting media reports that raised\\nquestions about the propriety of accepting large postelection contributions from lawyers that \\xe2\\x80\\x9chold special\\ncounsel contracts awarded by the attorney general\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noffice to represent public pensions, colleges, state agencies and more\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted); id. \\xc2\\xb6 75 (reporting\\nthat debt collection firms \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhose contracts were not renewed during the DeWine years were skeptical about\\nthe political purity of the contracting process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted).\\nSuch has been the pattern in other states, too,\\nwhere candidates have made millions of dollars in personal loans to their campaigns, then reimbursed themselves using post-election contributions, many of which\\nhave come from entities and individuals seeking business and favor from the government. See id. \\xc2\\xb6 76 (noting that, in 2018, Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt\\nraised over $800,000 in post-election contributions,\\nwith \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmore than $100,000 from political action committees funded by industries or special interests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted); id. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 77, 79 (in 1994, the Kentucky\\nRegistry of Election Finance observed that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]n the\\nlast fifteen years, Kentuckians have endured the\\nconsequences of millionaires \\xe2\\x80\\x98loaning\\xe2\\x80\\x99 their campaigns millions of dollars, only to be repaid by contributors seeking no-bid contracts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted); id.\\n\\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 80-81 (noting that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca majority of the [Alaska Public Offices] commissioners stated strong support for\\n\\n\\x0c20\\nbarring post-election contributions, and hoped such a\\nban would curtail contributions \\xe2\\x80\\x98intended to influence\\na successful candidate rather than the outcome of an\\nelection\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nFurther, despite the federal loan-repayment limit\\nbeing in effect for almost two decades, the FEC adduced evidence of federal candidates using personal\\nloans in a manner that circumvents contribution limits\\nand raises corruption concerns. See id. \\xc2\\xb6 71 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenate\\ncandidate Matt Rosendale\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2014 campaign debt was\\nrepaid in 2018 by \\xe2\\x80\\x98nine wealthy donors,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 eight of whom\\nhad already given the maximum to his 2018 campaign\\n. . .

The\\ndistrict court, however, dismissed the study for failing to show that the systematic \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvoting pattern\\nchanges\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it linked to candidate indebtedness were in\\nfact caused by rampant, undetected criminal bribes.\\nSee App. 25a.\\nFinally, and again with little explanation, the district court rejected robust polling data showing that\\nthe overwhelming public perception of post-election\\ncampaign contributions is that they are fundamentally\\ncorruptive. See id. \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 90-98 (describing April 2020\\nsurvey of 1,000 Americans, 81 percent of whom stated\\nthat they \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbelieved it was \\xe2\\x80\\x98very likely\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x98likely\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that\\n\\n\\x0c22\\nindividuals who donate money to a federal candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncampaign after an election expect a political favor in\\nreturn from candidates who later take office\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citations omitted).\\nIn sum, the FEC proffered substantial evidence of\\nthe corruptive effects of post-election political contributions used to repay candidate loans, but the lower\\ncourt dismissed it all as mere \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspeculation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 30a.\\nThis disregard for the evidence was arbitrary and constitutes a reversible error.\\nC. The district court failed to pay deference to Congress in an area of unique\\nlegislative expertise.\\nThe lower court also erred in failing to accord deference to Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evaluation of the potential dangers of post-election fundraising to repay candidate\\nloans, although this type of evaluation is squarely\\nwithin the expertise of legislators. Nixon, 528 U.S. at\\n402 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhere a legislature has significantly greater\\ninstitutional expertise . . . the Court in practice defers to empirical legislative judgments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Indeed, the\\nloan-repayment limit at issue here would seem to be\\nuniquely within the experience of legislators, many of\\nwhom have likely faced the fundraising pressures associated with post-election debt and the temptation to\\nbenefit personally from post-election campaign contributions.\\nThis Court has further recognized that Congress\\nmay combat corruption by focusing on the problems it\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nperceives as the most egregious and proceeding with\\nreform incrementally. See FEC v. Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Right to Work\\nComm., 459 U.S. 197, 209 (1982) (noting that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccareful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral laws,\\nin a \\xe2\\x80\\x98cautious advance, step by step,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 . . . warrants considerable deference\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted). But the lower\\ncourt nevertheless objected that the loan-repayment\\nlimit was \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubstantially underinclusive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because it\\napplies only to post-election contributions, not preelection contributions; and because it does not ban,\\nbut instead allows the use of up to $250,000 in postelection contributions to retire candidate loans. App.\\n32a-33a. Even putting aside the question of whether\\npre- and post-election contributions are interchangeable with respect to the risks they pose for abuse, it is\\nnot typically a constitutional problem when Congress\\nregulates campaign or other expressive activities too\\nlightly. \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]he First Amendment imposes no freestanding \\xe2\\x80\\x98underinclusiveness limitation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d requiring a legislature to \\xe2\\x80\\x9caddress all aspects of a problem in one fell\\nswoop; policymakers may focus on their most pressing\\nconcerns.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Williams-Yulee v. Fla. Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449\\n(2015).\\nThe lower court also did not acknowledge that\\nCongress must balance its pursuit of the anti-corruption\\ninterest against the need to ensure that candidates\\ncan \\xe2\\x80\\x9camass[] the resources necessary for effective advocacy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Buckley, 424 U.S. at 21, and can self-finance\\ntheir campaigns without undue restriction, id. at 5152. Because this balancing act requires a complex,\\nfact-dependent inquiry, uniquely within Congress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n\\x0c24\\nexpertise, the Court has consistently counseled deference to legislative judgments regarding the structure\\nof contribution limits and the design of solicitation restrictions. See Davis, 554 U.S. at 737; Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 248 (2006); McConnell, 540 U.S. at\\n137; Beaumont, 539 U.S. at 155; Nixon, 528 U.S. at 391,\\n397; Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Conservative PAC, 470 U.S. at 500; Cal.

FEC, 453 U.S. 182, 201 (1981); Buckley, 424\\nU.S. at 30.\\nHere, Congress balanced these important but\\nsomewhat conflicting goals by allowing candidates to\\nfreely spend and loan personal funds to support their\\ncampaigns, while electing to restrict only a particularly corruptive type of post-election fundraising to\\nrepay personal loans and only once it exceeds certain\\nmonetary parameters. This does not \\xe2\\x80\\x9craise doubts\\nabout whether the law advances the interests invoked\\nby the government,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d App. 32a; it demonstrates that\\nCongress is properly balancing competing compelling\\ninterests.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,\\n48-49 (1976). Section 304 of the Bipartisan Campaign\\nReform Act of 2002 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), now codified at 52\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j), violates this bedrock principle by\\nseeking to \\xe2\\x80\\x9clevel electoral opportunities for candidates\\nof different personal wealth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S.\\n724, 741 (2008).\\nSection 304, by design and effect, deters candidates from loaning money to their campaigns, through\\nthe mechanism of restricting the campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to\\nrepay those loans. It caps, at $250,000, the amount of\\ncandidate loans that a committee may repay using\\nfunds raised after election day. To be sure, the loans\\nmay still be repaid in full with funds raised prior to\\nthe election, but there can be no question that Section\\n304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94by substantially increasing the risk that\\nany candidate loan will never be fully repaid\\xe2\\x80\\x94forces\\na candidate to think twice before making those loans\\nin the first place. As the three-judge district court below unanimously held, this burden on a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nright to speak freely in favor of his own election \\xe2\\x80\\x9cruns\\nafoul of the First Amendment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.App.6a.\\nAppellant briefly attempts to defend Section 304\\non the merits, but it spends most of its Jurisdictional\\nStatement arguing that Appellees lack standing to\\nchallenge it. Not so. Appellees have clearly been injured by the loan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94they executed a\\nloan during Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 reelection campaign that was\\nsubject to the limit, on which the Committee was\\nforced to partially default because of the limit. Appellant argues that this injury is traceable only to Section\\n304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s implementing regulations and not to Section 304\\nitself. This argument, which by Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own admission was never raised in the court below, is based\\non a plain misreading of the record facts, one that runs\\ndirectly counter to Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s correct reading of the\\nfacts in the court below. But the overriding point is\\nthat Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new standing argument is an utterly\\nirrelevant distraction, for even if Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reconceived understanding of the record was accurate, this\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case law clearly demonstrates that Appellees\\nhave standing to challenge both the implementing\\nregulation directly causing them harm and the constitutional validity of the statutory provision that the\\nregulation implements. After all, BCRA Section 304 is\\nthe sole and exclusive source of Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority\\nto regulate the repayment of candidate loans in the\\nfirst place\\xe2\\x80\\x94and if Section 304 is struck down, the regulations implementing it obviously must fall from the\\nsame blow. That is, if the host perishes, so also must\\nits parasite.\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument that Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injury is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-inflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d fares no better. Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subjective\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmotivation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in making and waiting more than 20\\ndays after the election to repay the 2018 loan, J.S.16,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chas no bearing on [Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99] standing to challenge\\nthe law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under longstanding and uniform precedent\\nfrom this Court, J.S.App.53a. And FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insistence\\nthat the Cruz Committee could have found a way to\\nfully repay Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans using only the preelection funds that Section 304 allows also poses no\\nbarrier to standing. For as the court below held, what\\nthis argument boils down to is that Cruz could have\\navoided his injury \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby subjecting himself to the very\\nframework he alleges is unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. 54a.\\nThis Court has never suggested that a plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nstanding is defeated if he could have avoided all harm\\nby complying with the very law he challenges as contrary to the First Amendment.\\nThis Court should summarily affirm\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, failing\\nthat, note probable jurisdiction and set the case for\\nplenary consideration.\\nSTATEMENT\\nI.\\n\\nSection 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Limit on the Repayment of\\nCandidate Loans.\\n\\nFederal law generally allows candidates to make\\nloans to their authorized campaign committees without limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94loans which BCRA defines as a form of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpenditure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nby\\nthe\\ncandidate.\\n52\\nU.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 30101(9)(A)(i). However, Section 304 of BCRA imposes a $250,000 limit on a committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nrepay those \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccandidate loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with money contributed\\nby donors after the election:\\nAny candidate who incurs personal loans\\nmade after the effective date of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 in connection with the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s campaign for election shall not repay (directly or indirectly),\\nto the extent such loans exceed $250,000,\\nsuch loans from any contributions made to\\nsuch candidate or any authorized committee\\nof such candidate after the date of such election.\\n52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j).\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations implementing this provision require, inter alia, that any repayment of over\\n$250,000 in candidate loans be made \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithin 20 days\\nof the election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(c)(1). Any amount\\nof a candidate loan in excess of $250,000 that is not\\nrepaid within those first 20 days cannot be repaid at\\nall, for it must be treated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a contribution by the\\ncandidate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xc2\\xa7 116.11(c)(2).\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations further provide that contributors may not make any post-election contributions designed to repay over $250,000 in candidate\\nloans\\xe2\\x80\\x94even if those post-election contributions comply with the current $2,900 contribution limit with respect to that candidate and that election. See id. \\xc2\\xa7\\n110.1(b)(1); 86 Fed.

J.S.App.8a. At the\\nend of November 6, the Committee did not have sufficient funds to both repay these loans and satisfy the\\nCommittee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other creditors. In fact, while the Committee ended the election campaign with approximately $2.38 million deposited in, or in transit to, its\\nbank accounts, it owed about $2.7 million\\xe2\\x80\\x94including\\nthe $260,000 it owed to Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x94leaving it with\\napproximately $337,748 in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnet debts outstanding,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as\\nof election day. D. Ct. Doc. 61-2, \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 36-38 (June 9,\\n2020). During the 20 days following the election, the\\nCommittee used its cash on hand to satisfy debts to\\nother creditors rather than repay Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloans. Id. \\xc2\\xb6 40. Only in December of 2018, more than\\n20 days after the election, did the Committee repay\\nSenator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans. Id. \\xc2\\xb6 41. In compliance with the\\nchallenged limits, the Committee only repaid Senator\\nCruz $250,000, leaving a total of $10,000 unpaid.\\nJ.S.App.9a.\\nREASONS FOR SUMMARY\\nAFFIRMANCE OR DISMISSAL\\nAppellant contends that Senator Cruz and his\\nCommittee lack standing to challenge Section 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nloan-repayment limit and that the district court erred\\nin striking it down under the First Amendment. Both\\narguments are plainly contrary to this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedent.\\nI.\\n\\nThe District Court Correctly Held that Appellees Have Standing.\\n\\nIt is undisputed that Senator Cruz loaned the\\nCruz Committee $260,000 before the 2018 election.\\nJ.S.3. At that moment, Appellees became subject to\\nSection 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limits on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpool[s] of funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that could\\nbe used to repay Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans. J.S.17. And because in the 20 days after the election the Cruz Committee used its limited cash on hand to repay its other\\ncreditors rather than Cruz, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSenator Cruz is still owed\\n$10,000\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94a sum that, under Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulatory\\n20-day-rule, can no longer lawfully be repaid.\\nJ.S.App.51a.\\nAppellant does not dispute that the unpaid\\n$10,000 debt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis plainly a cognizable injury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id., nor\\nthat Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injury is redressed by the decision in\\ntheir favor. Instead, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standing argument is\\nlimited to the requirement of causation or traceability, J.S.8, which it challenges based on two distinct arguments. Neither is persuasive.\\nA.\\n\\nAppellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Injuries Are Traceable to\\nBCRA Section 304.\\n\\nFirst, Appellant argues that Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial injury is traceable to the FEC regulations implementing Section 304, but not Section 304 itself, depriving Appellees of standing to challenge Section 304\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nunder this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent decision in California v.\\nTexas, 593 U.S. ---, 141 S. Ct. 2104 (2021). According\\nto Appellant, because the $250,000 the Cruz Campaign repaid to Cruz beginning in December of 2018\\ncame solely from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpre-election funds, nothing in\\nBCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan-repayment provision stops the committee from using contributions raised after the election\\nto repay the remaining $10,000 owed to Senator\\nCruz.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.11. Instead, Appellant says, what prevents\\nthe repayment of the $10,000 balance is 11 C.F.R. Section 116.11(c)(2)\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requirement that once 20 days after\\nelection day have passed, the Committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmust treat\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 outstanding balance [of the loan] \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 as a contribution by the candidate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rendering it un-reimbursable. Appellant thus concludes that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]t is that regulation\\xe2\\x80\\x94not the statutory loan-repayment limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94that\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nis the source of Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $10,000 injury. J.S.12.\\nAs Appellant admits, it chose not to raise this argument before the district court. Id. at 13. That was\\nthe better choice, because the argument is completely\\nwithout merit, both as a matter of fact and as a matter\\nof law. As to facts, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim that the Committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepaid Senator Cruz using only pre-election\\nfunds,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 10, is flat-out false. It is based on a misreading of the record below and a misunderstanding\\nof federal election law. But Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s errors are ultimately irrelevant (although we will return to them,\\nand correct them, below), for even if one accepts Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inaccurate account of the record facts, Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 $10,000 financial injury is, as a matter of law,\\ndirectly traceable to the constitutional infirmity in\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nSection 304. That conclusion is evident from bedrock\\nprinciples of administrative law and is confirmed by\\ndecades\\xe2\\x80\\x99 worth of landmark constitutional decisions.\\nWe turn first to this dispositive point.\\n1. Because \\xe2\\x80\\x9can administrative agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to\\nregulate \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 must always be grounded in a valid grant\\nof authority from Congress,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 161 (2000), \\xe2\\x80\\x9can\\nagency literally has no power to act \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 unless and until Congress confers power upon it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Louisiana Pub.\\nServ. Comm\\xe2\\x80\\x99n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 357 (1986). And\\ngiven the black-letter rule that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]n unconstitutional law is void, and is as no law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ex parte Siebold,\\n100 U.S. 371, 376 (1879), it necessarily follows that\\nwhere a statutory provision is invalid and unenforceable, any implementing regulations that were promulgated under its authority are likewise invalid and\\nunenforceable. See Chicago, Indianapolis, & Louisville Ry. Co. v. Hackett, 228 U.S. 559, 566 (1913) (unconstitutional law is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas inoperative as if it had never\\nbeen passed, for an unconstitutional act is not a law,\\nand can neither confer a right or immunity nor operate to supersede any existing valid law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); 5 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 706(2)(C) (courts shall \\xe2\\x80\\x9chold unlawful and set aside\\nagency action \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe application of these settled principles in this\\ncase is clear. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulation is wholly parasitic\\nupon Section 304 itself; it was promulgated under its\\nauthority, see 68 Fed. Reg. 3970, 2973 (Jan. 27, 2003),\\nand Appellant quite obviously could not have\\n\\n\\x0c9\\npromulgated it were Section 304 not on the books.\\nThere can thus be no dispute that under the district\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling that Section 304 is unconstitutional, 11\\nC.F.R. Section 116.11, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20-day limit, cannot be enforced any longer. Indeed, that is why the\\ndistrict court, upon holding Section 304 unconstitutional, dismissed Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 separate claims challenging Section 116.11 as moot. J.S.App.38a.\\nAccordingly, the causal link between the $10,000\\ninjury inflicted by Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulatory 20-day rule\\nand the unconstitutionality of Section 304 is clear and\\ndirect. It is only because Section 304 was enacted that\\nAppellant had authority to promulgate the regulatory\\n20-day limit at all. The only intermediate link in the\\nchain of causation between Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injury and Section 304 is a parasitic regulatory provision that derived all of its legal authority from the statute that it\\nimplements\\xe2\\x80\\x94and that, with the statute held unconstitutional, can no longer be enforced.\\nThis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases have long held that plaintiffs\\nin exactly this profile have standing to challenge not\\njust the regulation or agency action that immediately\\ncaused their injury but the statutory provision that\\nauthorized it. Just last Term in Collins v. Yellen, for\\nexample, the Court held that shareholders injured by\\nagency action taken by the Federal Housing Finance\\nAgency had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s structure, expressly concluding that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe traceability requirement is satisfied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even though\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe shareholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concrete injury flows directly from\\n[the agency action]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe [statutory]\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nremoval restriction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 594 U.S. ---, 141 S. Ct. 1761,\\n1779 (2021).\\nSimilarly, the Court found standing in Clinton v.\\nCity of New York to challenge the Line Item Veto Act\\neven though the plaintiffs were immediately injured\\nby the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cancellation of certain tax benefits\\nto which they were otherwise entitled, not the Act\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ngeneral provision authorizing that cancellation, explaining that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraceability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceasily satisfied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d since\\ntheir \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinjury is traceable to the President\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cancellation of [the benefits].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 524 U.S. 417, 433 n.22 (1998).\\nAnd in MWAA v. Citizens for Abatement of Aircraft\\nNoise, Inc., the Court allowed homeowners near\\nWashington National Airport who alleged injury from\\nthe risk of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincreased noise, pollution, and danger of\\naccidents\\xe2\\x80\\x9d posed by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincreased air traffic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that\\nwould result from a master plan imposed by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMWAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nto challenge the constitutionality of the MWAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s composition, specifically rejecting the argument that the\\nplaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinjuries are caused by factors independent\\nof\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the alleged constitutional violation. 501 U.S. 252,\\n264-65 (1991); see also Seila Law v. CFPB, 591 U.S.\\n---, 140 S. Ct. 2183, 2195-96 (2020); Bowsher v. Synar,\\n478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986); INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S.\\n919, 936 (1983); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 12, 118\\n(1976).\\nIndeed, separation-of-powers challenges to the\\nconstitutionality of agency actions commonly bear this\\nhost-parasite character. In the typical Appointments\\nClause challenge, for example, where a party injured\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nby agency action challenges the appointment of the official who promulgated it, the causal link is more attenuated than here. For in those cases, it is the general statutory provision governing the official\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appointment, rather than the specific statutory provision being implemented, that is alleged to be invalid.\\nYet in countless of these types of cases the Court has\\nproceeded directly to the merits of the constitutional\\nchallenge, because no one even dreamed of arguing\\nthat the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s injury was not fairly traceable to\\nthe alleged constitutional violation.

United States, 276 U.S.\\n394 (1928). These decisions illustrate the sea change\\nthat acceptance of Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument would cause\\nin the standard model of constitutional litigation.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\n2. Appellant does not address any of the decisions from this Court finding standing in materially\\nidentical circumstances. Instead, the only authority\\nAppellant cites for its argument is this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recent\\ndecision in California v. Texas. California has no application here.\\nIn California, several States (alongside two individuals) challenged Section 5000A(a) of the Affordable Care Act\\xe2\\x80\\x94the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminimum essential coverage requirement,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d colloquially known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual\\nmandate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94as unconstitutional. But the alleged injuries that gave rise to their standing (as relevant here)\\nwere inflicted by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother provisions of the Act, not the\\nminimum essential coverage provision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 141 S. Ct. at\\n2108, 2119. And as the Court repeatedly explained,\\nthe statutory provisions that had injured the State\\nplaintiffs \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperate independently of \\xc2\\xa7 5000A(a),\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]othing in the text\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of those provisions \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuggests\\nthat they would not operate without \\xc2\\xa7 5000A(a).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 2119, 2120 (emphasis added). Accordingly, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]o\\nshow that the minimum essential coverage requirement is unconstitutional would not show that enforcement of any of these other provisions violates the Constitution,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injuries were thus \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot\\nfairly traceable to enforcement of the allegedly unlawful provision of which the plaintiffs complain\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xc2\\xa7\\n5000A(a).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 2119 (quotation marks omitted).\\nAppellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 claims in this case are crucially different from the claims in California\\xe2\\x80\\x94and they differ for\\nprecisely the reasons that the Court singled out as depriving the State plaintiffs of standing in that case.\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nWhile California emphasized that the statutory provisions that had injured the State plaintiffs \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperate\\nindependently\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the separate provision they challenged as unconstitutional, id. at 2120, here the regulatory 20-day rule that has harmed Senator Cruz to\\nthe tune of $10,000 cannot operate at all without the\\nstatutory provision it implements, BCRA Section 304.\\nThe key problem for the States in California, then,\\nwas that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]o show that the minimum essential coverage requirement is unconstitutional would not show\\nthat enforcement of any of these other provisions\\n[causing the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injuries] violates the Constitution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 141 S. Ct. at 2119. But here the unconstitutionality of BCRA Section 304 obviously renders Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 20-day regulation unconstitutional and unenforceable as well.\\nThe inapplicability of California here is underscored by the debate in that case between the Majority\\nand Justice Alito concerning the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 severability\\nargument. Justice Alito\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissenting opinion argued\\nthat the States\\xe2\\x80\\x99 injuries were \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraceable to the individual mandate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because the separate provisions that inflicted those injuries \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot be severed from the mandate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 2131 (Alito, J., dissenting). The Majority\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdecline[d] to consider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d argument on the\\nground that it had been forfeited. Id. at 2116 (majority); see also id. at 2122 (Thomas, J., concurring) (concluding that the severability argument \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmight well\\nsupport standing in some circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but had not\\nbeen adequately presented). Here, of course, Appellees have argued from the beginning that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause\\n\\n\\x0c14\\nthe challenged statute is unconstitutional, the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nregulation implementing that statute, 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\n116.11, is likewise unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 1,\\n\\xc2\\xb6 46 (Apr. 1, 2019). And importantly, rather than depending on some \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnovel\\xe2\\x80\\x9d severability theory, Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standing is grounded on the bedrock principle\\nthat where an authorizing statute is unconstitutional\\nand invalid, the implementing regulations that it authorized are also unconstitutional and invalid.\\nCountless cases have been decided by this Court\\neither explicitly or implicitly based on materially\\nidentical logic. See supra, pp. 9-11. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attempt to extend California into this dispositively different context would thus upend the practice of constitutional litigation.\\n3. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s belated standing argument thus\\nplainly fails as a matter of law, and the Court may\\ndispose of it without reading any further. But the argument is also wrong on its own factual premise, for\\nit is based on Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s new and suspect understanding of the record below. Because Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to spring the argument for the first time on appeal deprived Appellees of the opportunity to address\\nit below, we feel bound here to clarify what the record\\nfacts actually show despite their ultimate irrelevance\\nto the question of Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standing.\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument is premised on the claim\\nthat the Committee \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepaid Senator Cruz $250,000\\nusing only pre-election funds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.10. Appellant explains that this assertion is based on Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\n\\n\\x0c15\\ndeposition testimony confirming that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he\\ncommittee did not receive any post-election\\ncontributions at any time after \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the general election of 2018.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The deponent explained that although the committee had\\ncontinued to receive contributions after election day 2018, it had designated those contributions for use in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe primary and the\\ngeneral 2024 election cycle,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that none\\nof those funds were treated as contributions\\nto Senator Cruz is 2018 campaign.\\nId. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s newly conceived understanding of\\nthese facts is based on a critical category mistake: it\\nconfuses the general category of money raised after\\nelection day with the subset of such funds that are\\nboth raised after the election and specifically designated as contributions for the previous election. As\\nnoted above, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regulations allow a contributor to donate money after an election that is designated to repay debts still outstanding from that election (subject to the contribution limits of that election)\\xe2\\x80\\x94what are known in the argot of campaign-finance law as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpost-election contributions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But a committee can also repay debt outstanding from one election with funds raised after that election and designated for the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next upcoming election. See\\n52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30114(a); 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 116.12(a). And because these contributions, no less than contributions\\nexpressly (and retroactively) designated to the previous election, are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmade to [the] candidate \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 after the\\n\\n\\x0c16\\ndate of [the relevant] election,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they too are subject to\\nSection 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $250,000 cap. 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j).\\nThus, when the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deponent said that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Committee did not receive any post-election contributions after the general election of 2018,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.10,\\nhe was using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpost-election contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as a term of\\nart, to refer only to contributions raised after the election and designated retroactively for the 2018 election.\\nIndeed, the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deponent further explained\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe committee had continued to receive contributions after election day 2018,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdesignated those\\ncontributions for use in \\xe2\\x80\\x98the primary and the general\\n2024 election cycle.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. (emphasis added); see also D.\\nCt. Doc. 65-9, 96 (July 14, 2020) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe committee received collections that went toward both the primary\\nand the general 2024 election cycle after Election\\nDay\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Again, these funds could be and were used to\\npay 2018 election debts.\\nAppellant fully understood this below. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own trial counsel, in response to the deponent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nquoted statements, remarked that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe public record\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nshows \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat there are individuals who did make contributions to the Ted Cruz for Senate Campaign after\\nthe general election of 2018,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which went \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctowards the\\n2024 election\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and could \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave been used to repay debt\\nfrom the 2018 campaign.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 95-97, 146.\\nAppellant also quotes the undisputed Statement\\nof Fact (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSOF\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]one of the $250,000 of the loan\\nthat was repaid was from contributions raised after\\nthe election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.10. But Appellant only quotes half of\\n\\n\\x0c17\\nthe SOF, omitting the following deposition testimony\\non which it was expressly based: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(30(b)(6) Dep. at 95\\n(FEC Exh. 9) (\\xe2\\x80\\x98the committee did not receive any general 2018 contributions after Election Day 2018.\\xe2\\x80\\x99).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D.\\nCt. Doc. 67-1, \\xc2\\xb6 64 (Aug. 11, 2020) (emphasis added).\\nThe cited SOF must be read, of course, in conjunction\\nwith the expressly quoted deposition testimony on\\nwhich it was based, and it is only in that qualified context that Appellees admitted it. Again, the same deposition testimony establishes that the Committee did\\nreceive contributions after the 2018 election, that\\nthose contributions were designated for the 2024 election, and that those contributions were available to\\npay 2018 election debts\\xe2\\x80\\x94facts that, again, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nown trial counsel affirmatively acknowledged during\\nthe deposition. D. Ct. Doc. 65-9, 96.\\nThat Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial counsel correctly understood these facts\\xe2\\x80\\x94that the Committee had raised\\n2024 money after the election and properly used it to\\npay off its $337,748 of net 2018 debt\\xe2\\x80\\x94likely accounts\\nfor Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision not to raise its newfound\\nstanding argument below. But whatever the reason,\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stratagem here, asking this Court not\\nonly to consider its new standing argument but also to\\nneedlessly prolong this case with a pointless immediate remand, should be firmly rebuffed. It is one thing\\nfor this Court to consider a standing argument presented for the first time on appeal. It is quite another\\nnot only to allow a party to spring a new standing argument on appeal, but then also to hand the party a\\n\\n\\x0c18\\nvacatur and remand back to the court where the party\\nshould have presented the argument in the first place.\\nIn short, the record shows that the Committee\\ndid in fact raise contributions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter the date of [the\\n2018] election,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(j), and that these\\ncontributions were available to and substantial\\nenough to repay all of the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2018 debts including $250,000 of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nassertion that the $250,000 repayment was made\\nwith pre-election money is thus simply wrong, and so\\nis its newly concocted standing argument.\\nB.\\n\\nAppellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Unpaid Loan, whether \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSelfInflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or Not, Is an Injury-In-Fact.\\n\\nAppellant also argues that Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n$10,000 financial injury is not traceable to the loanrepayment limit because it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas self-inflicted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.14.\\nThis argument fails too. Where the defendant is engaged in an ongoing violation of constitutional or statutory rights and a would-be plaintiff simply exercises\\nthe right that exposes himself to that violation, the injury is caused by the defendant, not the plaintiff.\\n1. Appellant repeatedly cites our stipulation before the district court that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sole and exclusive motivation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behind Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas to establish the\\nfactual basis for this challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.16. As the district\\ncourt correctly held, this reliance on Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subjective intent \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis easily disposed of.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.App.52a. The\\nreason Appellees stipulated to the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account of\\ntheir subjective motives is that under this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncase-law, these motives are utterly irrelevant.\\n\\n\\x0c19\\nFor example, in Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman,\\ntwo plaintiffs\\xe2\\x80\\x94one black and one white\\xe2\\x80\\x94inquired of\\nthe defendant landlord about the availability of apartments. 455 U.S. 363, 368 (1982). The black plaintiff\\ndid so \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully expecting that he would receive false information\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and had no \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintention of buying or renting\\na home.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 374. The defendant, in violation of the\\nFair Housing Act, consistently told the black plaintiff\\nthat there were no apartments available and told the\\nwhite plaintiff that there were vacancies. Id. at 368.\\nDespite the fact that the black plaintiff was a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctester\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwho merely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpose[d] as [a] renter[ ],\\xe2\\x80\\x9d this Court held\\nthat he had standing. Id. at 373.\\nSimilarly, in Evers v. Dwyer, the Court held that\\nan African-American plaintiff had standing to challenge Memphis, Tennessee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s segregated bus system\\neven though he was only exposed to the challenged\\ndiscrimination because he purposefully boarded a bus\\nand sat in the whites-only section \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor the purpose of\\ninstituting this litigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 358 U.S. 202, 203 (1958).\\nThe district court dismissed the challenge for lack of\\nan \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactual controversy,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but this Court reversed, holding that the fact that the plaintiff \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay have boarded\\nthis particular bus for the purpose of instituting this\\nlitigation is not significant.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 204.\\nIndeed, a contrary view would call into question\\nseveral landmark cases striking down racial segregation and other forms of unconstitutional discrimination. The plaintiffs in Brown v. Board of Education,\\n347 U.S. 483 (1954), would not have had standing to\\nchallenge racial segregation unless they had been\\n\\n\\x0c20\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonally denied equal treatment by the challenged\\ndiscriminatory conduct.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S.\\n737, 755 (1984) (quotation marks omitted); see also\\nWarth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 502 (1975). They therefore voluntarily sought, and were denied, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadmission\\nto schools attended by white children under laws requiring or permitting segregation according to race.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBrown, 347 U.S. at 488. Contrary to the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s logic,\\nthe fact that the Brown plaintiffs willfully exposed\\nthemselves to their constitutional injury by voluntarily seeking admission to a segregated school did not\\ndefeat their standing; it created their standing.\\nFor the same reasons, Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 subjective motivations in making and repaying the 2018 loan are\\ncompletely irrelevant to the standing analysis.\\n2. The foregoing discussion also answers Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s related argument that Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 $10,000 injury\\nis \\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-inflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d because they could have avoided that\\ninjury by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cus[ing] [the $2.2 million pre-election funds\\non hand] to pay Senator Cruz $10,000 or more in the\\n20 days after the election\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimply chose not to do\\nso.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.14. The district court correctly explained why\\nthis argument fails: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe flaw in the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument\\nis that it would require Senator Cruz to avoid an injury by subjecting himself to the very framework he\\nalleges is unconstitutional.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.App.54a. A plaintiff,\\nlike the black \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctester\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in Havens Realty, does not forfeit standing merely because he refuses to abide by or\\notherwise conform his conduct to the very restriction\\nhe challenges as unlawful.\\n\\n\\x0c21\\nNor is the notion that a plaintiff must avoid, if\\npossible, a constitutional injury by refusing to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo the\\nvery thing she claims she has a right not to do,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at\\n55a, supported by the three cases Appellant cites. The\\nplaintiffs in Clapper v. Amnesty International challenged the constitutionality of provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act authorizing government surveillance of certain international electronic\\ncommunications. 568 U.S. 398 (2013). They sought to\\nground their standing on costly measures (e.g., travel\\ncosts for in-person meetings) they had taken to avoid\\nmaking international electronic communications and\\nthus to eliminate the risk of government interception. Because the threat of any particular government\\ninterception was highly speculative rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccertainly impending,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the self-imposed costs they incurred to avoid exercising their claimed constitutional\\nright to engage in confidential international electronic\\ncommunications were \\xe2\\x80\\x9csimply the product of their fear\\nof surveillance, and \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 such a fear is insufficient to\\ncreate standing.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 417.\\nThis case would at least be parallel to Clapper if\\nCruz had limited his campaign loan to $250,000 to\\navoid the risk of nonpayment created by Section 304,\\nand then had sought to ground his standing to challenge Section 304 on the theory that he had been injured because he had refused to exercise his constitutional right to loan his campaign more than $250,000.\\nBut even in that circumstance, Clapper would be beside the point given that FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enforcement of Section\\n304 against any given violation is not speculative at\\n\\n\\x0c22\\nall, let alone in the multiple ways that FISA surveillance of any given international communication is.\\nSee Davis, 554 U.S. at 734 (finding standing in preenforcement challenge). Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 constitutional\\nclaim is that Cruz has a First Amendment right to\\nloan money to his campaign free from governmental\\nrestrictions as to amount and time of repayment. That\\nCruz could have avoided his $10,000 loss by refusing\\nto loan his campaign more than $250,000, or by requiring repayment in full within 20 days, does not\\nchange the fact that he suffered a $10,000 injury by\\nexercising his constitutional right to make the loan\\nthat he did.\\nMcConnell v. FEC, 540 U.S. 93 (2013), is also distinguishable. McConnell held that plaintiffs could not\\nchallenge BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution limits as being set too\\nhigh based on the supposed \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompetitive injury\\xe2\\x80\\x9d they\\nsuffered because they did not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwish to solicit or accept\\nlarge campaign contributions as permitted by BCRA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 228. The plaintiffs made no claim that they had\\na constitutional right not to accept large donations,\\nmerely that this was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctheir own personal \\xe2\\x80\\x98wish,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d id.,\\nso McConnell is completely irrelevant here.\\nThe per curiam decision in Pennsylvania v. New\\nJersey, 426 U.S. 660 (1976), is irrelevant too, and for\\nthe same reason. There, several States challenged\\ntaxes that New Jersey and New Hampshire imposed\\non income earned within their borders by residents of\\nthe plaintiff States, arguing that the taxes violated\\nthe Privileges and Immunities Clause. But the plaintiff States (as opposed to their residents) were injured\\n\\n\\x0c23\\nby the challenged taxes only because of their choice\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cto extend a tax credit to their residents for income\\ntaxes paid\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the defendant States, which (combined\\nwith the challenged taxes) resulted in tax income being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiverted from their respective treasuries.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n663-64. And critically, none of the plaintiff States\\nclaimed a constitutional right to extend such tax credits. Here, by contrast, the whole point of Appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nFirst Amendment claim is that they do have a constitutional right to repay candidate loans with post-election contributions.\\nAppellant points to the settled rule that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca plaintiff cannot establish standing by asserting an abstract\\ngeneral interest common to all members of the public.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.15 (quotation marks omitted). But the interest asserted by Appellees is not the general one of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseeing\\nthat the law is obeyed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d FEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 24\\n(1998). It is the concrete First Amendment interest in\\nrepaying in full a specific loan in a manner free of unconstitutional restrictions that have resulted in Senator Cruz bearing the loss of a specific $10,000 sum.\\nAppellant next argues that under Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, Appellees needed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidentify a[ ]\\nspecific payment to a vendor or other creditor that the\\nCommittee would have been hindered from making,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.15, in order to justify their refusal to repay the\\nloan with pre-election funds. But the problem in\\nLujan\\xe2\\x80\\x94that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csome day\\xe2\\x80\\x9d intentions alleged by the\\nplaintiffs failed to establish any \\xe2\\x80\\x9c \\xe2\\x80\\x98actual or imminent\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ninjury,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 504 U.S. 55, 564 (1992)\\xe2\\x80\\x94plainly does not apply in this case, which concerns a loan that has\\n\\n\\x0c24\\nalready been made. Undisputed declaration testimony below establishes that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Cruz Committee did\\nnot have sufficient funds in its bank account on November 6, 2018, to repay Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans in full\\nand also to satisfy all of the Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that in the first 20 days \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Committee paid\\nsome creditors but did not repay any portion of Senator Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 65, Statement of Genuine\\nIssues, \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 35, 40 (July 14, 2020). Under this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nprecedent, that plainly suffices. See, e.g., Davis, 554\\nU.S. at 734 (finding standing without specific allegations concerning what activities candidate wished to\\nfund).\\nThe premise of both of Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lines of attack\\nappears to be that a plaintiff can avoid the charge of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cself-inflicted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d injury only if all of the options available to him would have resulted in giving him standing\\nto bring the exact same challenge. Appellant cites no\\nauthority in support of such a proposition, and it\\nmakes no sense. A plaintiff faced with an unconstitutional fine for speaking at a particular occasion can\\nplainly choose to speak, pay the fine, and then sue under the First Amendment without having to show that\\nif he had avoided the fine by declining to speak, he\\ncould have sued anyway. Compare, e.g., Arkansas\\nWriters\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 227\\n(1987) (publisher that paid discriminatory tax on the\\npress had standing); with Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1,\\n13 (1972) (no standing based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubjective chill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nalone). Similarly here, Appellees have alleged and established that they have suffered a concrete $10,000\\n\\n\\x0c25\\ninjury fairly traceable to the challenged restrictions\\nand that they could have avoided that injury only by\\ncomplying with the very restrictions they are challenging as unconstitutional. Article III requires no\\nmore.\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standing arguments are thus completely meritless, and this Court can and should dispose of them, along with the appeal as a whole, without further briefing by summarily affirming the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision. See this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Rule 16.1.\\nII.\\n\\nThe District Court Correctly Held that the\\nLoan-Repayment Limit Is Unconstitutional.\\n\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenge to the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision on the merits also fails.\\nA.\\n\\nBecause the Loan-Repayment Limit\\nBurdens Core Political Speech, It Is\\nSubject to Strict Scrutiny.\\n\\nThe loan-repayment limit burdens the core First\\nAmendment rights of candidates, committees, and\\ncontributors, so it must be subject to strict\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, at a\\nminimum, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94scrutiny.\\n1. The First Amendment protects the right of a\\ncandidate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto engage in the discussion of public issues\\nand vigorously and tirelessly to advocate his own election.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, 554 U.S. at 738. A candidate who loans\\nmoney to his campaign is exercising this core First\\nAmendment freedom both as a matter of common\\nsense and of BCRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpenditure,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwhich explicitly includes loans. 52 U.S.C.\\n\\n\\x0c26\\n\\xc2\\xa7 30101(9)(A)(i). And Section 304 imposes a direct and\\nsignificant burden on the exercise of this First Amendment right. By limiting the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpool of funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d committees\\nmay draw on to repay candidate loans, J.S.17, the\\n$250,000 cap necessarily increases the risk that these\\nloans will not be repaid in full, or perhaps at all. Appellant now describes this limit as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnarrow,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id., but\\nin briefing before the district court it acknowledged\\nthat when Section 304 applies, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca candidate deciding\\nto loan his or her campaign money in advance of the\\nelection [will] not be able to accurately determine the\\nlikelihood he or she might be repaid.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 26,\\n44 (June 7, 2019).\\nTrue, Section 304 does not directly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpose a ceiling on a campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to repay a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nloans,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.17, but that does not negate the First\\nAmendment violation. Davis is directly controlling on\\nthis point. While the \\xe2\\x80\\x9casymmetrical contribution\\nscheme\\xe2\\x80\\x9d portion of the Millionaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amendment at issue in Davis did \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot impose a cap on a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nexpenditure of personal funds, it impose[d] an unprecedented penalty on any candidate who robustly exercises that First Amendment right.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 554 U.S. at 73839, 740. And that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial and potentially significant\\nburden\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on core First Amendment rights, the Court\\nconcluded, could be upheld only if it satisfied strict\\nscrutiny. Id. at 739, 740. The portion of the Millionaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amendment challenged here triggers strict\\nscrutiny under this same reasoning. See also Arizona\\nFree Enter. Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett, 564\\nU.S. 721, 737, 740, 742 (2011).\\n\\n\\x0c27\\nAppellant argues that as a factual matter \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[m]ost\\nloans to election campaigns are for $250,000 or less\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he ratio of loans below $250,000 has not\\nchanged substantially from what the ratio was prior\\nto BCRA.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.18. That would be irrelevant even if it\\npainted an accurate picture of Section 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effect (and\\nas the district court found, it does not, see\\nJ.S.App.14a-15a). For the economic burden imposed\\non candidate spending by the loan-repayment limit is\\nplain as a matter of law, not to mention common\\nsense, and the Court need not pause to consider how\\nmany people it successfully deters from freely exercising their First Amendment rights. That is the clear\\nholding of Bennett, which squarely rejected the approach advocated by Appellant:\\n[T]he burden imposed by the [challenged]\\nprovision is evident and inherent in the\\nchoice that confronts privately financed candidates and independent expenditure\\ngroups\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. As in Davis, we do not need empirical evidence to determine that the law at\\nissue is burdensome. See 554 U.S., at 73840 (requiring no evidence of a burden whatsoever).\\n564 U.S. at 745-46 (citations and quotation marks\\nomitted). So too here.\\n2. In addition to candidates, the loan-repayment\\nlimit also burdens the rights of committees and contributors. By limiting a committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to repay\\ncandidate loans with post-election funds, the loan-\\n\\n\\x0c28\\nrepayment limit effectively forces it to choose between\\nusing its limited cash on hand to: (1) repay the over$250,000 balance of candidate loans (thereby foregoing, or at least delaying, funding First Amendment expression), or (2) repay other vendors (thereby deterring the candidate from loaning money in the future).\\nSection 304 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not provide any way in which a\\n[committee] can exercise [its First Amendment rights]\\nwithout abridgment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, 554 U.S. at 740. And the\\nloan-repayment limit also burdens the rights of contributors, by effectively creating a ceiling on overall\\npost-election contributions. See 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7 110.1\\n(b)(3)(ii)(C). At a minimum, the limit thus must be\\nsubjected to Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scrutiny. 424\\nU.S. at 25.1\\n3. Finally, Appellant urges that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]s applied in\\nthis case, the loan-repayment limit \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 did not impose\\nany meaningful constraint on appellees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.19. That point, even if true, is completely irrelevant, since Appellees challenged the limit as substantially overbroad on its face. It is black-letter law in the\\nFirst Amendment context that a party may \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchallenge\\na statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but rather because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe statute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nvery existence may cause others not before the court\\nShould the Court conclude that plenary consideration is\\nnecessary, Appellees reserve the right to argue that Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scrutiny for contribution limits either is tantamount to strict scrutiny or is inconsistent with the First Amendment. See Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC,\\n518 U.S. 604, 635-44 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting).\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c29\\nto refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 612,\\n613 (1973). That is the case here: because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe government has failed to demonstrate that the loan-repayment limit serves an interest in preventing quid pro\\nquo corruption,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.App.6a, the loan-repayment limit\\nis unconstitutional every time it applies.\\nIn any event, the loan-repayment limit did burden Appellees as applied in this case. It is undisputed\\nthat Senator Cruz loaned his Committee $260,000 before the 2018 election\\xe2\\x80\\x94thereby exercising \\xe2\\x80\\x9chis First\\nAmendment right to spend his own money for campaign speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, 554 U.S. at 738. And Appellees\\nwere indisputably burdened by the challenged loanrepayment limit: the limit barred the Cruz Committee\\nfrom repaying $10,000 of Cruz\\xe2\\x80\\x99s $260,000 loans with\\nany post-election contributions, and $10,000 of the\\nloans remain unpaid. Appellant again trots out its arguments about the motivations behind the loan,\\nJ.S.18-19, but this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedent holds that a\\nplaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s subjective motivations are irrelevant to the\\nmerits of his constitutional challenge. See Pierson v.\\nRay, 386 U.S. 547, 558 (1967).\\nB.\\n\\nThe Loan-Repayment Limit Fails even\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cClosely-Drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Scrutiny Because It\\nDoes Not Further any Anti-Corruption\\nInterest.\\n\\nBecause Section 304 burdens First Amendment\\nexpression, it is subject to strict scrutiny\\xe2\\x80\\x94or, at a\\nminimum, to Buckley\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclosely drawn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d scrutiny. It\\n\\n\\x0c30\\nflunks either standard, because it does not further any\\ninterest in preventing quid pro quo corruption or its\\nappearance.\\n1. Section 304 was never designed as an anticorruption measure, so if it did serve that interest, it\\nwould be pure happenstance. Instead, the provision\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nlegislative history leaves no doubt about the purposes\\nit was actually designed to serve: \\xe2\\x80\\x9clevel[ling] the playing field\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between competing candidates. 147 CONG.\\nREC. S2463 (daily ed. Mar. 19, 2001) (statement of\\nSen. DeWine). Section 304 was enacted as part of the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMillionaire\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Amendment,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which this Court has already held was designed to \\xe2\\x80\\x9clevel electoral opportunities for candidates of different personal wealth.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Davis, 554 U.S. at 741. And the legislative history makes\\nclear that this was also the specific purpose of the\\nloan-repayment limit in particular: as the Senator\\nwho principally drafted the loan-repayment limit repeatedly and explicitly explained, it had \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe same\\npurpose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the rest of the amendment, and this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpurpose is to level the playing field.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 147 CONG. REC.\\nS2541 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2001) (statement of Sen.\\nHutchison).\\nMoreover, Section 304 also had an even more\\nself-serving design\\xe2\\x80\\x94it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotects incumbents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 147\\nCONG. REC. S2544 (daily ed. Mar. 20, 2001) (statement\\nof Sen. Daschle). After all, while challengers often\\nneed to spend significant amounts of seed money to\\nraise name recognition even before they start to receive significant contributions, see Anderson v. Spear,\\n356 F.3d 651, 673 (6th Cir. 2004), incumbents \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave a\\n\\n\\x0c31\\nlot of advantages that do not come out of our personal\\ncheckbooks,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 147 CONG. REC. S2465 (daily ed. Mar. 19,\\n2001) (statement of Sen. Dodd). Both of these purposes are plainly illegitimate. See Bennett, 564 U.S. at\\n749-50; Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 248, 249\\n(2006) (opinion of Breyer, J).\\n2. Moreover, Section 304 cannot be justified as\\nan anti-corruption measure because the federal contribution limits already serve to adequately address\\nany corruption risk. The base limit of $2,900 per contributor (as adjusted for inflation) applies to all contributions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith respect to any election,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 52 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 30116(a)\\xe2\\x80\\x94so it governs post-election contributions\\nin the same measure as pre-election contributions.\\nThat eliminates any anti-corruption justification under McCutcheon v. FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s holding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCongress\\xe2\\x80\\x99s selection of a [$2,900] base limit indicates its belief that\\ncontributions of that amount or less do not create a\\ncognizable risk of corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 572 U.S. 185, 209, 210\\n(2014) (emphasis added). After all, the only effect of\\nstriking down the loan-repayment limit would be to\\nplace post-election contributions on equal footing with\\npre-election contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x94limited to the non-corrupting amount of $2,900 or less. See J.S.App.34a; Anderson, 356 F.3d 672-73 (striking down Kentucky limit on\\ncandidate loans for this reason).\\n3. Appellant attempts to get around this difficulty by arguing that the loan-repayments restricted\\nby Section 304 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpose[ ] a heightened risk of corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.25. That contention fails for multiple independent reasons.\\n\\n\\x0c32\\nAppellant first argues that the contributions limited by Section 304 are especially corrupting because\\nthey supposedly go \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinto the candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pocket.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 19. This argument fundamentally misunderstands\\nwhat happens when contributions are used to repay a\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loan. Such payments do not go into the\\ncandidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpocket,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id., they go to reimburse the candidate for money he spent on political speech furthering his election campaign. Of course, the repayment\\nallows the candidate to spend his own money for purposes unrelated to the campaign\\xe2\\x80\\x94in precisely the\\nsame manner as a pre-election contribution that obviates any need for the candidate to loan his own money\\nin the first place. But that hardly means that the candidate has pocketed the contribution, whether made\\nbefore or after the election, for his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal purposes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. While Appellant gestures towards the congressional restrictions on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal gifts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 21,\\nand the federal prohibition on using campaign funds\\nfor \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonal use,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d id. at 20, it does not even try to argue that the repayment of a candidate loan actually\\nviolates those limits. It plainly does not, and that is\\nthe end of this argument.\\nAppellant next argues that the loan-repayment\\nlimit is justified by the special corruption risks posed\\nby contributions made post-election, when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe donor\\ncan know \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 that the recipient will be in a position to\\ndo him official favors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. But apart from Section 304\\nitself, Congress has placed no limits on an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nability to contribute up to $2,900 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith respect to any\\nelection for Federal office\\xe2\\x80\\x9d after election day has\\n\\n\\x0c33\\npassed. 52 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 30116(a)(1)(A); see 11 C.F.R. \\xc2\\xa7\\n110.1(b)(3)(i). By the FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lights, any post-election\\ncontribution must pose a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheightened risk of corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.25. Yet federal law generally allows those\\ncontributions, up to $2,900\\xe2\\x80\\x94so this supposedly\\nheightened risk of corruption cannot justify Section\\n304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s limit on a small, arbitrary subset of them.\\nEven more fundamentally, Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument\\nwould also doom all contributions, pre- or post-election, to incumbent officeholders. As the district court\\nheld, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he FEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concerns \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 seem to apply equally\\nto any contribution made to an incumbent, because all\\nincumbents are in a position to grant favors. But Congress does not restrict pre-election contributions to incumbents except through the base contribution limit.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.App.33a. There is no dispute that any given contributor could have given Senator Cruz $2,800 (the\\nprevailing limit then) on November 7, 2018, if he had\\ndesignated it for the upcoming election cycle. The notion that the same contribution would have suddenly\\nbecome corrupting if it were instead designated for the\\n2018 election is farcical.\\nAppellant also suggests that post-election contributions are suspicious because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe primary legitimate rationales for donating to electoral campaigns\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpooling resources with other donors to facilitate political expression\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincreasing \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 the likelihood that the favored candidate will prevail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\xe2\\x80\\x9cdo\\nnot apply\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to post-election contributions. J.S.20-21.\\nAppellant neglects to mention the primary \\xe2\\x80\\x9crationale\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthat Buckley identified for contributions\\xe2\\x80\\x94that they\\n\\n\\x0c34\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cserve[ ] as a general expression of support for the candidate and his views,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 424 U.S. at 21\\xe2\\x80\\x94which does apply equally after the election. And besides, Appellant\\nis wrong that the two \\xe2\\x80\\x9crationales\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it identifies do not\\napply to post-election contributions. For at least with\\nrespect to candidates who may run again, contributors\\nsurely understand that helping repay debts from a\\nprior campaign will free up money that the candidate\\ncan spend on the next campaign.\\nNor can there be any argument that the supposedly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheightened risk of corruption\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is only present\\nwhere contributions both (1) are received \\xe2\\x80\\x9cafter the\\nwinner of the election is known\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and (2) go to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpersonally enrich\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the candidate. J.S.24, 25. For both of these\\nfactors are present to exactly the same degree whenever an incumbent officeholder loans money to his\\nreelection campaign and those loans are repaid with\\ncontributions received before election day. Yet Section\\n304 allows such pre-election contributions to be used\\nto repay an incumbent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s loans without limit.\\n4. In addition to these fatal analytical problems,\\nAppellant has failed to provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany evidence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that\\npost-election contributions used to repay candidate\\nloans have given rise to any \\xe2\\x80\\x9cactual corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.App.25a. Appellant puts forward three pieces of\\nsupposed evidence, but none is persuasive.\\nFirst, Appellant points to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca study showing that\\nindebted politicians, relative to their debt-free counterparts, are significantly more likely to switch their\\nvotes if they receive contributions from special\\n\\n\\x0c35\\ninterests between the votes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.22 (alteration and\\nquotation marks omitted). But as the district court\\nfound, the unpublished paper Appellant cites \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes\\nnot distinguish between voting pattern changes as a\\nconsequence of donor influence or access and voting\\npattern changes as part of quid pro quo corruption.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.App.25a. That fact completely deprives it of probative value, given that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmere influence or access is\\nnot the type of quid pro quo corruption that justifies\\ninfringements on political speech.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nMoreover, the paper does not even purport to analyze the sole question that is relevant in this litigation: whether post-election contributions used to repay candidate loans in excess of $250,000 pose some\\nheightened risk of corruption. To the contrary, the paper (1) is not limited to candidate loans; (2) is also not\\nlimited to post-election contributions; and (3) also does\\nnot distinguish between the first $250,000 of candidate loan-repayment contributions and the two-hundred, fifty-thousand-and-first dollar. See D. Ct. Doc.\\n67-1, \\xc2\\xb6 67.\\nSecond, Appellant asserts that it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cidentified numerous episodes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial favors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d granted after the\\nreceipt of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontributions designed to pay down personal debt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.22. But as the district court found, all\\nof Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s anecdotes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvolve only concerns that\\ncandidates will be too responsive to the influence of\\nspecial interests or concerns about contributions unrelated to the repayment of candidate loans.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.App.23a-24a; see, e.g., D. Ct. Doc. 67-1, \\xc2\\xb6 69 (former FEC employee simply asserting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat lobbyists\\n\\n\\x0c36\\nmake debt-retirement contributions \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 because they\\nbelieve the contribution will benefit the Member who\\nreceives it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); id. at \\xc2\\xb6 76 (simply reporting contributions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfunded by industries or special interests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to repay candidate loans); \\xc2\\xb6 79 (raising concerns about preelection contributions). Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to identify\\nany meaningful evidence of quid quo pro corruption is\\nhighly significant: as the district court noted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmany\\nstates impose no restriction on using post-election\\ncontributions to repay candidate loans, and the Commission fails to identify any problems with quid pro\\nquo corruption or its appearance in these states.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nJ.S.App.23a (footnote omitted).\\nThird, Appellant points to \\xe2\\x80\\x9copinion polling showing that more than 80% of respondents believed that\\nindividuals who donate money to a campaign after an\\nelection expect political favors in return.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.22-23.\\nBut the poll in question\\xe2\\x80\\x94which \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwas conducted at the\\nFEC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behest for this litigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.App.27a\\xe2\\x80\\x94 falls\\nrisibly short. The poll misleadingly asked respondents\\nhow they would feel \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f there were no limit on how\\nmuch money a federal campaign could raise after\\nElection Day to repay a candidate,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d D. Ct. Doc. 67-1,\\n\\xc2\\xb6 95 (emphasis added), without mentioning that federal base contribution limits still apply. Moreover, because the survey failed to ask about post-election\\nfundraising for the repayment of other types of campaign debt, it cannot show that the respondents\\nviewed the specific payments limited by Section 304\\nas specially corrupting. J.S.App.28a. And \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe poll did\\nnot define the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98political favor,\\xe2\\x80\\x99 so the poll\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n\\x0c37\\nresponses are not evidence that the public associates\\nsuch contributions with quid pro quo corruption,\\nwhich Congress may regulate, or simply increased influence and access, which Congress may not.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.2\\nC.\\n\\nThe Loan-Repayment Limit Is Not Sufficiently Tailored.\\n\\nEven if the loan-repayment limit did somehow\\nfurther the interest in curbing quid pro quo corruption, it is not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnarrowly tailored to achieve [that] objective.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d McCutcheon, 572 U.S. at 218. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s justification for the limit\\xe2\\x80\\x94that post-election donors\\nknow \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat the recipient will be in a position to do him\\nofficial favors,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.20\\xe2\\x80\\x94obviously has no purchase\\nwith respect to losing candidates. J.S.App.32a; see\\nalso Anderson, 356 F.3d at 673. Appellant notes that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpost-election contributions generally flow to winning\\ncandidates,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.23, but there are far more losing candidates than winning ones, so even if a smaller fraction of them are able to raise debt-retirement money,\\nSection 304\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overbreadth remains substantial. And\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablishing separate rules for winning and losing\\ncandidates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would not create an unconstitutional\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9casymmetrical contribution scheme,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d J.S.23, since unlike the scheme struck down in Davis this asymmetry\\nwould not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimpermissibly burden[ ] [a candidate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s]\\nFirst Amendment right to spend his own money for\\ncampaign speech,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 554 U.S. at 738.\\nIndeed, the political scientist who supervised the poll admitted that she herself understood the phrase \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolitical favor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to\\ninclude access. D. Ct.

The\\nCalifornia Supreme Court issued its order denying\\nKinderCare\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition for discretionary review on April\\n28, 2021. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 1257(a).\\nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED\\nTitle 9 United States Code, Section 2\\nValidity, irrevocability, and enforcement of\\nagreements to arbitrate.\\nA written provision in any maritime transaction\\nor a contract evidencing a transaction involving\\ncommerce to settle by arbitration a controversy\\nthereafter arising out of such contract or\\ntransaction, or the refusal to perform the whole\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nor any part thereof, or an agreement in writing\\nto submit to arbitration an existing controversy\\narising out of such a contract, transaction,\\nor refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and\\nenforceable, save upon such grounds as exist\\nat law or in equity for the revocation of any\\ncontract.\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\nCalifornia courts have frequently evinced hostility to\\narbitration. Over the past three decades, this Court has\\nrepeatedly reversed decisions from California courts that\\nhave been hostile to arbitration and have refused to follow\\nthis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s direction concerning the interpretation and\\npre-emptive scope of the Federal Arbitration Act (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFAA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThis case provides another example, where the\\nCalifornia courts have decided simply to disregard without\\nexplanation the controlling Supreme Court decision in\\nLamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, 139 S. Ct. 1407, 1417 (2019)\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLamps Plus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). The Court in Lamps Plus held that, when\\na court is deciding whether an arbitration agreement\\nis enforceable, the FAA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s doctrines for interpreting\\narbitration agreements displace contrary state law\\ndoctrines\\xe2\\x80\\x94including the particular doctrine of contra\\nproferentem. That state law doctrine is at direct odds with\\nthe FAA doctrine that where an arbitration agreement\\nreasonably can be construed as permitting arbitration,\\nambiguities should be construed in favor of arbitration\\nirrespective of which party drafted the agreement.\\nHere, after the trial court correctly recognized that\\nthe arbitration agreement allowed for arbitration of claims\\n(except for claims under the Private Attorneys General\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nAct (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPAGA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that were not at issue in the motion to compel\\narbitration), the court of appeal nonetheless issued a writ\\nof mandate holding that none of the claims in the case were\\nsubject to arbitration. It drew this conclusion based on its\\nconstruction of the portions of the arbitration agreement\\naddressing the impact of the presence of PAGA claims\\non arbitration of other claims. Specifically, the court of\\nappeal held that the agreement should be interpreted as\\nbanning arbitration of any claims if the complaint at issue\\ncontained a PAGA claim.\\nDespite this ultimate conclusion, the court of appeal\\nconceded that the arbitration agreement could be read in\\ntwo reasonable ways, one which would have supported the\\ntrial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order compelling arbitration and the other\\nwhich would have led to a denial of the motion to compel\\narbitration. Relying on a pre-Lamps Plus appellate\\ndecision, Securitas Security Services USA, Inc. v. Sup.\\nCourt, 234 Cal. App. 4th 1109 (2015) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecuritas\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), which in\\nturn purported to rely upon a 30-year-old Supreme Court\\ncase, Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514\\nU.S. 52 (1995), the court of appeal held that because the\\nemployer drafted the arbitration agreement, the state law\\ndoctrine of contra proferentem required any ambiguity to\\nbe construed against it. Although KinderCare brought the\\nLamps Plus opinion to the court of appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention and\\nexplained how Lamps Plus required the opposite result,\\nthe court of appeal did not even acknowledge the existence\\nof Lamps Plus in its ruling, and it further summarily\\ndenied a petition for rehearing that expressly called out\\nthat it had not taken Lamps Plus into account even though\\nit was controlling and on point. As such, the court of appeal\\ndid not even attempt to distinguish a controlling authority\\nfrom this Court on FAA interpretation.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nSupreme Court review is necessary to address the\\nconflict between the Securitas decision and the Lamps\\nPlus decision on the use of the contra proferentem\\ndoctrine to determine whether claims are arbitrable under\\nambiguous arbitration agreements governed by the FAA.\\nBecause this is a simple matter of federal supremacy on\\na federal issue (the preemptive effect of the FAA), the\\nCourt can summarily address this issue, as it did in SonicCalabasas A., Inc. v. Moreno, 132 S. Ct. 496 (2011), by\\nvacating the state court order and instead ordering that\\nthe state court reconsider the issue in light of Lamps Plus.\\nI.\\n\\nThe Westmoreland Lawsuit\\n\\nOn January 24, 2019, individually and on behalf of\\nother purportedly similarly situated employees, Rochelle\\nWestmoreland (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) filed a putative class action\\ncomplaint against KinderCare in the superior court of\\nthe State of California, County of San Francisco, case no.\\nCGC-19-573125 (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cComplaint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). (Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Appendix\\nof Exhibits in Support of Petition for Peremptory Writ of\\nMandate (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWrit Appendix\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) at 1.) On February 26, 2019,\\nPlaintiff filed a first amended complaint (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFAC\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) adding\\nPAGA claims pursuant to Labor Code Section 2698 et.\\nseq. (Writ Appendix at 10-20).\\nThe FAC asserts class claims for relief arising out of\\nthe Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged receipt of an electronic pay card\\nat the time of her termination. Accordingly, Plaintiff\\nasserts class claims for violation of California Labor\\nCode Sections 201-203, 211, and 212. Plaintiff seeks to\\nrepresent a putative class of \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a]ll former employees who\\nwere employed by Defendants in the State of California\\nat any time from January 24, 2016, through the present,\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nwhose employment was separated for any reason . . . and\\nduring their employment was paid their wages via a nonpaycard method but upon their separation of employment\\nreceived their final wages in the form of a paycard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPutative Class\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). (Writ Appendix at 4 and 13).\\nPlaintiff also filed PAGA representative claims based\\non alleged violations of California Labor Code Sections\\n201-203, 212, and 213 arising from the allegedly unlawful\\npractice of issuing electronic paycards as final payment\\nof wages. (Writ Appendix at 18).\\nII. Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Arbitration Agreement with KinderCare\\nPlaintiff signed an arbitration agreement when\\nshe became a KinderCare employee. The following are\\npertinent parts of that agreement. (Writ Appendix at\\n55-58).\\nFirst, the arbitration agreement expressly states that\\nit is governed by the FAA (and nobody has disputed that\\npoint). (Writ Appendix at 58).\\nSecond, the agreement defines the scope of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccovered\\nclaims.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Writ Appendix at 55). With some specific\\nexceptions, covered claims include all employment related\\nclaims and, more specifically, wage and hour claims, such\\nas those that KinderCare sought to compel to arbitration.\\nThird, the agreement provides that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccovered claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ndo not include \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclaims that cannot be required to be\\narbitrated as a matter of law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Writ Appendix at 55,\\nemphasis added.) Nobody in this action disputes that,\\nunder governing California Supreme Court authority,\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nPAGA claims are a type of claim that an employer cannot\\nrequire employees to submit to arbitration through a predispute arbitration agreement (which is why KinderCare\\ndid not seek to compel the PAGA claims to arbitration).\\nFourth, the agreement provides that the arbitration\\nwill be only on an individual basis and that the employee\\nwaives \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto the maximum extent permitted by law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the right\\nto participate in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany class, collective, or representative\\nproceeding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Writ Appendix at 56).\\nFifth, the agreement contains a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSavings Clause\\nand Conformity Clause,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which addresses what occurs\\nwhen specific provisions of the agreement are deemed\\nunenforceable:\\nIf any provision of this agreement is determined\\nto be unenforceable or in conf lict with a\\nmandatory provision of applicable law, it shall\\nbe construed to incorporate any mandatory\\nprov ision, a nd /or th e un enfo rceabl e o r\\nconflicting provision shall be automatically\\nsevered and the remain of the agreement shall\\nnot be affected. Provided, however, that if\\nthe Waiver of Class and Collective Claims is\\nfound to be unenforceable, then this agreement\\nis invalid and any claim brought on a class,\\ncollective or representative basis must be filed\\nin a court of competent jurisdiction, and such\\ncourt shall be the exclusive forum for such\\nclaims.\\n(Writ Appendix at 58, emphasis added).\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nIII. The Trial Court Granted a Motion to Compel\\nArbitration of Non-PAGA Claims\\nKinderCare subsequently moved to compel arbitration\\nof Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-PAGA claims on an individual basis.\\nKinderCare did not move to compel arbitration of the\\nPAGA claims, as KinderCare understood that PAGA\\nclaims are not arbitrable. The trial court ultimately\\ncompelled arbitration of Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s non-PAGA claims on an\\nindividual basis as KinderCare had requested. (App. C).\\nIV. The Court of Appeal Reversed and the California\\nSupreme Court Denied Review\\nPlaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandate on March\\n23, 2020 on the basis that the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision\\nallegedly ran counter to a state appellate precedent,\\nSecuritas Security Services USA, Inc. v. Sup. Court, 234\\nCal. App. 4th 1109 (2015). After considering preliminary\\nopposition, the court of appeal issued an alternative writ\\nof mandate on January 29, 2021 directing the trial court\\nto vacate its order compelling arbitration and instead\\norder that no part of the action was arbitrable. (App. A).\\nThe court of appeal examined the above-listed\\nprovisions of the arbitration agreement and expressly\\nrecognized an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacknowledged ambiguity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the scope of\\nthe arbitration clause arising from the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSavings Clause\\nand Conformity Clause\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at page 4 of the agreement.\\nAlthough the court of appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision was rather terse,\\nit appears the court of appeal recognized that one possible\\nconstruction of the arbitration agreement was to require\\nthat class claims that are otherwise subject to arbitration\\nmust be sent to individual arbitration, while PAGA claims,\\n\\n\\x0c8\\nwhich as a matter of law are not subject to pre-dispute\\narbitration agreements, must proceed in court. Under this\\ninterpretation, the arbitration agreement would have been\\ninvalidated only to the extent it called for arbitration of\\nclaims not subject to arbitration as a matter of law, and\\nan employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mere assertion of a PAGA claim within a\\nlawsuit of otherwise arbitrable claims was insufficient to\\ninvalidate the arbitration agreement as a whole.\\nAn alternative interpretation favored by Plaintiff,\\nhowever, was to constr ue the enti re a rbitration\\nagreement as becoming inoperative in the face of a PAGA\\nrepresentative claim regardless of any other aspect of the\\nlawsuit. In other words, if PAGA claims were deemed to be\\nwithin the scope of the Agreement despite the language\\nthat the agreement did not apply to claims that are not\\narbitrable as a matter of law, and if the Savings Clause\\nand Conformity Clause invalidated the entire arbitration\\nagreement to the extent a court ruled that a PAGA\\nrepresentative claim could not lawfully be compelled to\\narbitration on an individual basis, then it would follow\\nthat the motion to compel arbitration should have been\\ndenied in total.1\\nFrom the bare premise of two reasonable constructions\\nof the agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s terms concerning the scope of arbitrable\\nclaims, the court of appeal held that interpretation of the\\nagreement favored by Plaintiff must control based on the\\ncommon law doctrine of contra proferentem. The court of\\nappeal held that this result flowed necessarily from the\\nSecuritas precedent:\\n1. For purposes of this Petition, KinderCare does not\\ndispute that there are two possible constructions of the arbitration\\nagreement, both of which could be deemed reasonable.\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nThe acknowledged ambiguity in the Savings\\nClause and Conformity Clause should be\\nresolved against [KinderCare], the party that\\ndrafted the arbitration agreement, Securitas\\nSecurity Services USA, Inc. v. Superior Court\\n(2015) 234 Cal. App. 4th 1109, 1126, citing\\nMastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton,\\nInc. (1995) 514 U.S. 52, 62.)

See Lamps Plus, 139 S. Ct. at 1417. In\\nLamps Plus, the employee signed an arbitration agreement\\nthat contained no express reference to class arbitration,\\nbut it stated that \\xe2\\x80\\x9call claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d arising out of employment\\nwould be subject to arbitration. The Ninth Circuit had\\nrelied on the contra proferentem doctrine to construe the\\narbitration agreement against an employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proffered\\nconstruction and in favor of the employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposed\\nconstruction. The Ninth Circuit adopted an interpretation\\nthat the agreement allowed for class arbitration as part of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9call claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d clause (as the employee argued) in favor\\nof the employer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument that the agreement allowed\\nonly for individual arbitration because it was silent on\\nclass procedures. Id. at 1413. Nobody disputed, however,\\nthat the action was subject to arbitration.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nThe United States Supreme Court reversed the Ninth\\nCircuit and expressly held that the state law contra\\nproferentem rule was preempted by the FAA and was\\nreplaced by the FAA doctrines governing construction\\nof arbitration agreements. The specific FAA doctrine\\nthat the Ninth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interpretation had offended was\\nthat arbitration was a product of consent, and it was\\nimproper to assume in the absence of express statement\\nthat an employer would consent to class arbitration,\\nwhich the Court held to be fundamentally different from\\nthe type of arbitration contemplated by the FAA. Id. at\\n1415-16. The Court also recognized another fundamental\\nFA A doctrine \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthat ambiguities about the scope of\\nan arbitration agreement must be resolved in favor of\\narbitration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1418 (citing Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\\nv. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 105 S. Ct. 3346 (1985)).\\nThe Court did not limit its holding simply to the issue of\\nwhether an agreement should be interpreted to allow for\\nclass or individual arbitration, but couched its decision as\\none where FAA-specific interpretative doctrines preempt\\ncontrary state law doctrines. Id.\\nThe Securitas decision to which the court of appeal\\ncited is a pre-Lamps Plus state appellate decision that\\nmust give way to Lamps Plus on the federal issue of FAA\\npreemption. See Sonic-Calabasas A., Inc. v. Moreno,\\n57 Cal. 4th 1109, 1124 (2013) (recognizing U.S. Supreme\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to overrule even California Supreme Court\\non issues of FAA preemption). Although Securitas cites\\nto a decade old Supreme Court decision (Mastrobuono),\\nnothing in Mastrobuono addressed how to construe a\\nprovision in an arbitration agreement that was ambiguous\\nas to whether claims were arbitrable.\\n\\n\\x0c12\\nInstead, the dispute in Mastrobuono was over a\\ncollateral issue of whether the arbitration agreement\\ngave the arbitrator authority to impose punitive damages\\ndespite New York state law doctrines depriving arbitrators\\nof the right to award them. After finding that the New\\nYork law was preempted, the Court resolved the issue of\\nthe arbitrator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s power to award punitive damages using\\nstandard contract interpretation principles. See 514 U.S.\\n55-63. Key to the discussion was the fact that whether\\nor not the arbitrator had the power to impose punitive\\ndamages did not conflict with any FAA doctrines, so the\\nuse of ordinary contract principles was entirely consistent\\nwith the FA A. Indeed the Court in Mastrobuono\\nreiterated the applicability of the general FAA doctrine\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cambiguities as to the scope of the arbitration clause\\nitself [are] resolved in favor of arbitration.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 62.\\nApplying the same reasoning here requires that,\\nto the extent there are ambiguities as to whether the\\nnon-PAGA claims are subject to arbitration, those\\nambiguities must be construed in favor of arbitration if\\nthey reasonably could be so construed, regardless of who\\ndrafted the arbitration agreement. The FAA doctrine thus\\ndisplaces the generalized common law contra proferentem\\ndoctrine. This understanding of Lamps Plus is squarely\\ninconsistent, however, with the court of appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasoning\\nin issuing the writ of mandamus because the court of\\nappeal construed the ambiguity against finding claims\\nto be arbitrable despite acknowledging that it would\\nbe plausible to interpret the agreement as requiring\\narbitration of the non-PAGA claims.\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nII. The Court Should Grant Review to Resolve the\\nDispute Between State Appellate and United States\\nSupreme Court Decisions on an Important and\\nRecurring Issue\\nThe primary reason for this Court to grant review is\\nto settle a dispute among decisions where the underlying\\nissue is recurrent. The California courts of appeal seem\\nto generate new published decisions on the arbitrability\\nof disputes every few weeks, and the topic of arbitrability\\nin class and collective actions has generated multiple\\nCalifornia Supreme Court decisions and half a dozen\\nUnited States Supreme Court decisions just since 2010.\\nAs such, courts of appeal plainly are in need of ongoing\\nguidance as to how to interpret arbitration agreements\\nthat are potentially ambiguous as to whether they require\\narbitration of the claims asserted.\\nHere, there can be no doubt that there is an\\ninconsistency between the reasoning employed by the\\ncourt of appeal in Securitas and the holding of the\\nUnited States Supreme Court in Lamps Plus. Because\\nthis dispute involves an issue of FAA preemption, the\\nUnited States Supreme Court should have the final word\\nand should be followed in all cases. See Sonic-Calabasas,\\n57 Cal. 4th at 1124 (recognizing United States Supreme\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supremacy over state law on the issue of FAA\\npreemption). As such, if this Court agrees that Securitas\\nand Lamps Plus are at odds on the issue of the use of\\ncontra proferentem to address arbitrability of disputes,\\nit must resolve this dispute, clarify this important area\\nof law, and provide guidance to state courts on the FAA\\npreemption issue.\\n\\n\\x0c14\\nFurthermore, the California courts take the position\\nthat using contra proferentem is required by the Supreme\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Mastrobuono decision, when that plainly is not\\nthe case when the doctrine is inconsistent with the FAA.\\nAs such, the Court can also clarify its own precedents\\nand explain how Lamps Plus is readily harmonized\\nwith Mastrobuono, but neither case allows state law to\\ncontravene FAA interpretative doctrines.\\nIn the absence of this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention, California\\nappellate courts will continue to rely on Securitas/\\nMastrobuono as a mechanism to invalidate properly\\nenforceable arbitration agreements in violation of the\\nstrong federal policy in favor of arbitration.\\nThe court of appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s error is manifest from reviewing\\nthe record below and is a candidate for summary reversal\\nwithout need of a hearing. Accordingly, KinderCare\\nrespectfully requests that this Court grant review to\\nsummarily remand the case back to the California Courts\\nwith instructions to reconsider in light of Lamps Plus.\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor all these reasons, KinderCare respectfully urges\\nthe Court to grant this petition for writ of certiorari.\\nRespectfully submitted\\nThomas R.

Defendant\\ncontends that the capitalization of the exact name of the\\n\\n\\x0c13a\\nAppendix C\\nclause (i.e. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWaiver of Class and Collective Claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) in\\nthe Savings Clause & Conformity Clause demonstrates\\nthat the second sentence is triggered only when the\\nentirety of the Waiver of Class and Collective Claims\\nis unenforceable. Plaintiff asserts (1) the first sentence\\nof the Savings Clause & Conformity Clause discusses\\nseverability of any provision of the agreement, and (2)\\nthe second sentence operates as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoison pill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, which\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmandates that if any part of [the] Waiver of Class\\nand Collective Claims provision is unenforceable, then\\nDefendant itself wants the entire Arbitration Agreement\\nvoided, as opposed to just a portion of the agreement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nTo support her argument, Plaintiff contends that the\\nSavings Clause & Conformity Clause is analogous to the\\nnonseverability clause in Securitas Security Services\\nUSA, Inc. v. Sup. Ct. (2015) 234 Cal.App.4th 1109,1125.\\n(See Opp. at 9.) In Securitas, Paragraph No.4 of the\\ndispute resolution agreement provided:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[T]here will be no right or authority for any\\ndispute to be brought, heard or arbitrated\\nas a class, collective or representative action\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x98Class Action Waiver\\xe2\\x80\\x99). Notwithstanding any\\nother clause in this agreement, the preceding\\nsentence shall not be severable from this\\nAgreement in any case in which the dispute to\\nbe arbitrated is brought as a class, collective or\\nrepresentative action.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Id. at 1114 [emphasis supplied].) The Securitas Court\\nconcluded that Paragraph No.4 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunambiguously reflect[ed]\\nthe parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intent that where a disput is subject to\\n\\n\\x0c14a\\nAppendix C\\nthe arbitration agreement [] and is \\xe2\\x80\\x98brought as a class,\\ncollective or representative claim\\xe2\\x80\\x99 [], the provision waiving\\nsuch claims, even if later determined to be illegal or\\nunenforceable, cannot be severed from the remainder\\nof the agreement . . . [n]otwithstanding any other\\nclause in the agreement.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (See id. at 1126.) Because the\\nunenforceable PAGA waiver was not severable, the Court\\nheld that the dispute resolution agreement at issue was\\nunenforceable in its entirety. (See id. at 1127.)\\nThe following language in Securitas, Paragraph\\nNo.4 was significant: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other\\nclause in this agreement, the preceding sentence shall\\nnot be severable from this agreement[.]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Id. at 1125.),\\nDissimilar to Paragraph No. 4 in Securitas, the Savings\\nClause & Conformity Clause does not explicitly nullify\\nthe application of other clauses in the Arbitration\\nAgreement to the Waiver of Class and Collective Claims.\\n(See Arbitration Agreement, 4.) Instead, the Savings\\nClause & Conformity Clause provides that if the Waiver\\nof Class and Collective Claims is unenforceable, then\\nthe entire agreement is invalid, without specifying\\nwhether the entire waiver or any portion of the waiver\\nmust be deemed unenforceable to render the Arbitration\\nAgreement invalid.\\nIn isolation, because the Savings Clause & Conformity\\nClause does not unambiguously address the applicability\\nof the Arbitration Agreement\\xe2\\x80\\x99s other clauses to the Waiver\\nof Class and Collective Claims, it is unclear how the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpoison pill\\xe2\\x80\\x9d applies where, as here, the Court determines\\nthat the Waiver of Class and Collective Claims contains\\n\\n\\x0c15a\\nAppendix C\\nan unenforceable PAGA waiver.\\n2.\\n\\nThe Arbitration Agreement in its Entirety\\n\\nDespite the Savings Clause & Conformity Clause\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\napparent ambiguity when examined in isolation, the Court\\nmust consider the Arbitration Agreement as a whole.\\n(See Bank of the West, supra, Cal.4th at 1265.) When\\nconsidered in its entirety, the Arbitration Agreement\\nshows that the parties intended to limit the agreement\\n(including the Waiver of Class and Collective Claims) to\\nthe bounds of the law. (See Reply, 7.)\\nFirst, the plain language of the Waiver of Class and\\nCollective Claims expresses an intent that the waiver\\nonly be enforced \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto the maximum extent permitted by\\nlaw[.]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Arb. Agreement, 2 [emphasis supplied].) Second,\\nthe Waiver of Class and Collective Claims specifies that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ccovered claims will be arbitrated.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Id.) In pertinent part,\\nthe definition of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCovered claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d excludes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cany claims\\nthat cannot be required to be arbitrated as a matter of law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Id. at 1 [emphasis supplied].) Third, the first sentence of\\nthe Savings Clause & Conformity Clause provides that\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cif any provision of this agreement is determined to be\\nunenforceable or in conflict with a mandatory provision\\nof applicable law, it shall be construed to incorporate\\nany mandatory provision, and/or the unenforceable or\\nconflicting provision shall be automatically severed and\\nthe remainder of the agreement shall not be affected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (See\\nArb. Agreement, 4.) The Court agrees with Defendant\\nthat collectively through the terms of these clauses, the\\nArbitration Agreement invites the Court to sever any\\nunenforceable provisions of the Waiver of Class and\\n\\n\\x0c16a\\nAppendix C\\nCollective Claims which go beyond what is permitted by\\nlaw. (See Reply, 7-8.) Thus, it logically follows that the\\nsecond sentence of the Savings Clause & Conformity\\nClause operates to invalidate the Waiver of Class and\\nCollective Claims only where the entirety of the waiver\\nis unenforceable.\\nIn sum, the Arbitration Agreement as a whole\\nmanifests the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 intended illegal portions of the\\nWaiver of Class and Collective Claims to be severable.\\nTo the extent any ambiguity exists, it must be resolved in\\nfavor of arbitration. (Lamps Plus, Inc. v. Varela, supra,\\n139 S.Ct. at 1418.)\\nIV. The Unenforceable PAGA Waiver is Severable and\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Remaining Claims Fall Within the\\nScope of the Arbitration Agreement\\na.\\n\\nBackground Law\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[W]hether a contract is entire or separable depends\\nupon its language and subject matter, and this question\\nis one of construction to be determined by the court\\naccording to the intention of the parties. If the contract\\nis divisible, the first part may stand, although, the latter\\nis illegal . . . [A] contract is not divisible where there is a\\nshowing that it was the intention of the parties to treat\\n[their] agreement as an entire contract, and where it\\nappears that their engagements would not have been\\nentered into except upon the clear understanding that\\nthe full object of the contract should be performed.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(Securitas, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at 1126 [emphasis in\\noriginal] [quotations and citations omitted].) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCourts are to\\n\\n\\x0c17a\\nAppendix C\\nlook to the various purposes of the contract. If the central\\npurpose of the contract is tainted with illegality, then the\\ncontract as a whole cannot be enforced. If the illegality\\nis collateral to the main purpose of the contract, and the\\nillegal provision can be extirpated from the contract by\\nmeans of severance or restriction, then such severance\\nand restriction are appropriate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Little v. Auto Stiegler,\\nInc. (2003) 29 Cal.4th 1064, 1075.)\\nb.\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nFor the reasons discussed supra, in Part III.b., the\\nlanguage, subject matter, and the intentions of the parties\\nclearly demonstrate that the Arbitration Agreement is\\ndivisible. (See Securitas, supra, 234 Cal.App.4th at 1126.)\\nThe illegal PAGA waiver is collateral to the overarching\\npurpose of enforcing the terms of the Arbitration\\nAgreement in conformity with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmandatory provision[s] of\\napplicable law[.]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Arb. Agreement, 4.) As such, the PAGA\\nwaiver is severable and the remainder ofthe Arbitration\\nAgreement remains enforceable.\\nThe parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs first cause\\nof action alleging violations of Labor Code sections 201203 falls within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.\\n(Compare Motion, 6-7 with Opp., 4 [\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis Motion requires\\nonly a review of a single case because the Arbitration\\nAgreement contains a \\xe2\\x80\\x98poison pill\\xe2\\x80\\x99 provision.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d].) Further,\\nthe claims for alleged violations of section 201-203\\nfall within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement.\\n(Compare Arb. Agreement, 1 [\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCovered Claims\\xe2\\x80\\x9d include\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstatutory or common law legal claims alleging the\\nunderpayment, overpayment, or mistimed payments of\\n\\n\\x0c18a\\nAppendix C\\nwages, expenses . . . timing or amount of pay at separation,\\ndeduction or fee disputes, . . . claims to fines or penalties,\\nor any other claimed violations of wage-and-hour practices\\nor procedures under local, state or federal statutory or\\ncommon law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d] with FA \\xc2\\xb6\\xc2\\xb6 31-35 [alleging Defendant\\nviolated the Labor Code by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailing and refusing to pay\\nall wages due and earned to discharged employees at the\\ntime of their termination, or within 72 hours.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d].)\\nThus, Plaintiffs first cause of action brought pursuant\\nto Labor Code sections 201-203 is subject to the terms of\\nthe Arbitration Agreement.\\nV. A Stay Is Warranted Pending Arbitration\\nThe Court stays the action pending the outcome of\\narbitration pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure \\xc2\\xa7 1281.4\\nunless Plaintiff elects to pursue PAGA only claims in this\\nCourt.\\nCONCLUSION\\nThe Court grants Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (1) motion to compel\\narbitration of all of Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s individual claims (with the\\nexception of her PAGA claim) and (2) request for stay of\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s PAGA claim.\\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\\nDated: January 13, 2020\\n/s/\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nANDREW Y.S.

In this case, after the plan of\\nreorganization\\nwas\\nconsummated,\\nPetitioner\\ndisclaimed any desire to have it unwound; instead,\\nhe sought an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual payout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of his claim.\\nBecause this individual payout was barred as a\\nmatter of law by the Bankruptcy Code, the Third\\nCircuit rejected his appeal under equitable\\nmootness.\\nIn this Court, Petitioner does not\\nchallenge the Third Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s application of equitable\\nmootness or rejection of his individual payout\\nremedy. Instead, for the first time in years of\\nlitigation, he asks this Court to reject the doctrine of\\nequitable mootness altogether.\\nThe question\\npresented is:\\nWhether the doctrine of equitable mootness is\\nconsistent with the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s recognition that\\nbankruptcy cases are inherently proceedings in\\nequity, and courts should not employ any remedy\\nthat would be inequitable or violate the law.\\n\\n\\x0cii\\nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT\\nRespondent Nuverra Environmental Solutions,\\nInc. is a publicly held company.

See In re UNR Indus., Inc., 20 F.3d\\n766, 769 (7th Cir. 1994) (Easterbrook, J.).\\nFor decades, courts universally have agreed that,\\nin some cases, it would defeat the bankruptcy\\nprocess designed by Congress and injure\\ninnumerable third parties for an appellate court to\\nundo consummation of a plan years later, even if\\nthat could somehow be done. Accordingly, because of\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9creliance interests engendered by the plan,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSubstantial consummation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(A) transfer of all or\\nsubstantially all of the property proposed by the plan to be\\ntransferred; (B) assumption by the debtor or by the successor to\\nthe debtor under the plan of the business or of the management\\nof all or substantially all of the property dealt with by the plan;\\nand (C) commencement of distribution under the plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 11\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1101(2).\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0c2\\ncoupled with the difficulty of reversing critical\\ntransactions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d every court of appeals applies a\\ndoctrine that sometimes is called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitable\\nmootness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to reject certain bankruptcy appeals\\nwhere the only conceivable remedy is the complete\\nunwinding of a consummated plan. Id. at 770.\\nEquitable mootness is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnarrow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doctrine that\\ncourts apply \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith a scalpel, not an axe.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re\\nTribune Media Co., 799 F.3d 272, 278 (3d Cir. 2015).\\nIn fact, while the Petition touts judicial \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccriticism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nthe equitable mootness doctrine, Pet. i, it fails to\\nacknowledge that the doctrine and its application\\nhave narrowed over time, in response, in part, to\\nsuch criticism.\\nAs a result, as now applied,\\napplication of the equitable mootness doctrine\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cshould be the rare exception.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re SemCrude,\\nL.P., 728 F.3d 314, 321 (3d Cir. 2013).\\nFor example, the Petition highlights then-Judge\\nAlito\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dissent from twenty-five years ago in In re\\nCont\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Airlines, 91 F.3d 553 (3d Cir. 1996).\\nContinental applied equitable mootness with a focus\\nsolely on the implications of plan reversal on third\\nparties and the success of the plan. Then-Judge\\nAlito criticized the majority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to consider\\nwhether a remedy could be fashioned that would not\\nresult in the complete undermining of the confirmed\\nplan. Id. at 571-72 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[W]e retain the ability to craft,\\nor to instruct the district or bankruptcy courts to\\ncraft, a remedy that is suited to the particular\\ncircumstances of the case. Thus, a remedy could be\\nfashioned in the present case to ensure that the\\nContinental reorganization is not undermined.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nPresently, the test for equitable mootness\\nemployed by the Third Circuit asks: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) whether a\\nconfirmed\\nplan\\nhas\\nbeen\\nsubstantially\\nconsummated; and (2) if so, whether granting the\\nrelief requested in the appeal will (a) fatally\\nscramble the plan and/or (b) significantly harm third\\nparties who have justifiably relied on the plan.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet.\\nApp. 31 (citation and internal quotation marks\\nomitted). In applying this test, and in recognition of\\nthen-Judge Alito\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concern, the Third Circuit\\nspecifically\\xe2\\x80\\x94and carefully\\xe2\\x80\\x94considers whether any\\nremedy could be fashioned for the appellant that\\nwould not undermine the debtor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s consummated\\nreorganization. As the Third Circuit said in this\\ncase, equitable mootness is a doctrine:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98by which an appellate court deems it\\nprudent for practical reasons to forbear\\ndeciding an appeal when to grant the\\nrelief requested will undermine the\\nfinality and reliability of consummated\\nplans of reorganization.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 In re Tribune\\nMedia Co., 799 F.3d 272, 277 (3d Cir.\\n2015) . . . .\\nThere is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98strong\\npresumption\\nthat\\nappeals\\nfrom\\nconfirmation orders of reorganization\\nplans . . . need to be decided[,]\\xe2\\x80\\x99 . . . and\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98a court may fashion whatever relief is\\npracticable instead of declining review\\nsimply because relief is not available.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nIn re Blast Energy Servs., Inc., 593 F.3d\\n418, 425 (5th Cir. 2010).\\nPet. App. 8.\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nThe cautious approach taken by the Third\\nCircuit also is evident in decisions of other circuits.\\nSee, e.g., Blast Energy Servs., 593 F.3d at 425; In re\\nTranswest Resort Props., Inc., 801 F.3d 1161, 1169\\n(9th Cir. 2015) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThird parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reliance on the\\nconsummation of the plan is not enough to find this\\nprong satisfied;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d instead, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe specific relief sought\\nmust bear unduly on innocent third parties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nIndeed, applying these and similar principles,\\ncourts have regularly declined to hold that an\\nappeal is equitably moot, even after substantial\\nconsummation of a plan has occurred.2\\nUntil his petition for certiorari in this Court,\\nPetitioner David Hargreaves (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cHargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) had no\\nqualms with the Third Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s test for equitable\\nmootness.

App. 34 (emphasis added).\\nThus, the Third Circuit framed the sole question as\\nfollows:\\nHere, the contending parties frankly\\nstate, and we agree, that the Plan has\\nbeen substantially consummated under\\npart one of the equitable mootness test.\\nThere also appears to be agreement\\nunder part two that the only relief that\\nmight not fatally scramble the Plan\\nwould be an individual payout of a\\nrelatively small sum, like the $450,000\\nthat Hargreaves seeks. The question\\nthus becomes whether such relief is\\npermitted by the Bankruptcy Code, and\\nthe short answer is it is not.\\nPet. App. 9.\\nPerhaps recognizing that his sole \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual\\npayout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d argument below has no merit, Hargreaves\\nnow reverses course and abandons that argument in\\nthis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x94nowhere challenging the Third Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconclusion that an individual payout is prohibited by\\nthe Bankruptcy Code. Instead, for the first time in\\nyears of litigation, Hargreaves mounts a frontal\\nassault on equitable mootness, asking this Court to\\n3 Citations taking the form \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD.D.E. ___\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refer to entries on the\\ndocket of the district court in case number 17-cv-01204 (D.\\nDel.).\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nnow reject a decades-old doctrine that is universally\\nsupported by the courts of appeals.\\nThe Petition should be denied for at least three\\nreasons. First, even if this Court were inclined to\\nrevisit equitable mootness at this late date, this is\\nnot the vehicle to do it. Hargreaves forfeited the\\nquestion he presents: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[w]hether the doctrine of\\nequitable mootness is inconsistent with the federal\\ncourts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98virtually unflagging\\xe2\\x80\\x99 obligation to hear and\\ndecide cases within their jurisdiction.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPet. i.\\nNowhere was this argument raised by Hargreaves\\nbelow, either at the district court or at the Third\\nCircuit. To the contrary, the Third Circuit applied\\nthe equitable mootness test advocated by\\nHargreaves. He should not now be permitted to\\nchallenge the validity of that test simply because he\\ndoes not like the outcome of the decision.\\nMore fundamentally, given the positions taken by\\nHargreaves, this case is not just \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitably moot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94it\\nis constitutionally moot under Article III. As noted\\nabove, Hargreaves explicitly forswore\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thus\\nforfeited\\xe2\\x80\\x94any claim that the plan should be\\nrevoked, and does not now challenge the Third\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rejection of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual payout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d remedy\\nthat he sought in place on his own volition.\\nAccordingly, even if Hargreaves were right that the\\nbankruptcy plan was flawed due to so-called\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9chorizontal gifting,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d there is no remedy left to cure\\nthat flaw. See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U. S. 165, 172\\n(2013) (explaining Article III mootness arises when\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is impossible for a court to grant any effectual\\nrelief whatever\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n\\x0c7\\nSecond, the question presented does not warrant\\nthis Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review. Hargreaves does not and cannot\\nidentify any circuit split or any unsettled question.\\nThat\\nis\\nbecause,\\ndespite\\nHargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nmischaracterization of it as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new abstention\\ndoctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adopted by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cseveral courts of appeals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet.\\ni (emphasis added), every circuit court over the last\\nfour decades has adopted equitable mootness in\\nsome form. Over time, the courts have narrowed the\\ndoctrine to apply only in rare cases, protecting the\\nrights of aggrieved parties to appeal where possible\\nand ensuring that the development of bankruptcy\\nlaw is not stunted.\\nThird, equitable mootness is consistent with this\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases. Equitable mootness has nothing to do\\nwith whether a federal court should abstain from\\nhearing a case due to federalism concerns. Pet. 3-4\\n(citing abstention cases). Nor does it have anything\\nto do with the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standing cases (Pet. 5) or cases\\nwhere a court has wrongfully determined that it\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9clacked jurisdiction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to review an appeal (Pet. 5-6).\\nInstead, equitable mootness is a bankruptcy\\ndoctrine, grounded in the Bankruptcy Code\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsuggestion that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccourts should keep their hands off\\nconsummated transactions,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d UNR Indus., 20 F.3d at\\n769, and in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cage-old principle that in formulating\\nequitable relief a court must consider the effect of\\nthe relief on third parties,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re Envirodyne Indus.,\\nInc., 29 F.3d 301, 304 (7th Cir. 1994) (Posner, J.).\\nPut differently, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbankruptcy courts are courts of\\nequity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Young v.

Bankruptcy Court Proceedings\\nRespondents, Nuverra Environmental Solutions,\\nInc., and its affiliates (collectively, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNuverra\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), which\\ncollectively operate as an oilfield logistics company,\\nfiled petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the\\nBankruptcy Code on May 1, 2017.\\nUpon the\\ncommencement of their chapter 11 cases, Nuverra\\nhad approximately $460 million in secured\\nindebtedness, see JA0366, JA0387 (Solicitation and\\nDisclosure Statement),4 with a midpoint estimated\\nvaluation of approximately $302.5 million. Id. at\\nJA0449. Due to the deficiency of asset value to\\nsatisfy secured claims, there was no expectation on\\nthe petition date that, under the priority scheme\\noutlined in the Bankruptcy Code,5 unsecured\\ncreditors would receive any recovery in the chapter\\n11 cases.\\nNonetheless, Nuverra, via extensive negotiations\\nwith creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x94including the official committee of\\nunsecured creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x94presented a comprehensive\\nsettlement and plan of reorganization to the\\nbankruptcy court that provided an enhanced\\nCitations taking the form \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJA ___\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refer to entries in the Joint\\nAppendix filed by the parties in the court of appeals at Docket\\nNo. 18-3084.\\n\\n4\\n\\nSee generally 11 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1129(b) (requiring, among other\\nthings, that, for a plan to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair and equitable,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a senior class\\nof creditors, absent its consent, must be paid in full before\\njunior classes receive any recovery).\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0c9\\nrecovery to unsecured creditors. These distributions\\nto unsecured creditors were made possible by the\\nwillingness of secured creditors to accept a reduced\\nrecovery below what they were entitled to under the\\nBankruptcy Code.\\nAs part of the settlement, most of this recovery\\nwas appropriately allocated to the class of creditors\\n(Class A7) whose claims arose out of Nuverra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dayto-day business operations (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nThis treatment facilitated Nuverra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to\\ncontinue operating as a going concern. Another\\nclass, consisting of holders of Nuverra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 9.875%\\nsenior notes (Class A6), also received enhanced\\nrecovery, though this represented a small percentage\\nof their $40.4 million in claims.\\nHargreaves was a holder of the 2018 notes in\\nClass A6, and a former member of the official\\ncommittee of unsecured creditors.\\nDespite the\\nenhanced recovery to creditors of Class A6,\\nHargreaves objected to confirmation of the plan of\\nreorganization,\\nalleging\\nthat\\nthe\\nseparate\\nclassification of the 2018 noteholders from the\\nbusiness creditors in Class A7 was improper. He\\nfurther argued that the difference in the recovery\\nbetween the two classes constituted unfair\\ndiscrimination and that the plan violated the\\nBankruptcy\\nCode\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrequirement\\nthat\\na\\nnonconsensual plan be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair and equitable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d JA1344JA1360\\n(Unsecured\\nBondholder\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nObj.\\nto\\nConfirmation).\\nAfter considering Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 objection and the\\nevidence, the bankruptcy court issued a decision on\\nJuly 24, 2017. In that decision, the bankruptcy court\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nfound that the separate classification of the\\nunsecured noteholders from the business creditors\\nwas appropriate, that the treatment afforded each\\nclass did not unfairly discriminate, and that\\ntreatment was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair and equitable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d under the\\nBankruptcy Code. On July 25, 2017, the bankruptcy\\ncourt issued an order confirming the plan.\\nB. District Court Proceedings\\nHargreaves appealed the bankruptcy court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndecision to the district court, seeking reversal of the\\nbankruptcy court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order, which would have resulted\\nin the unwinding of the plan. Hargreaves moved for\\na stay pending appeal, but that request was denied\\nby the district court on August 3, 2017. JA2541JA2549 (Mem. Order Den. Mot. to Stay Pending\\nAppeal). Hargreaves chose not to appeal denial of\\nthe stay.\\nWith Hargreaves not having pursued an appeal\\nof the denial of his stay request, Nuverra then\\nconsummated the plan of reorganization, by, among\\nother things, incurring $71.79 million of postbankruptcy \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d financing, distributing millions of\\ndollars in cash, and issuing new shares of common\\nstock that began trading on the NYSE American\\nstock exchange.\\nSee Nuverra Envtl. Sol. Inc.,\\nQuarterly Report (Form 10-Q) at 13-33 (Nov. 8,\\n2017).\\nNuverra later filed a motion seeking\\ndismissal of Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 appeal on grounds\\nincluding equitable mootness. The issue of equitable\\nmootness was fully briefed before the district court,\\nand Hargreaves did not challenge the doctrine in any\\nway. JA2582-JA2613 (Official Tr. of Bankr. Appeal).\\n\\n\\x0c11\\nAlthough Hargreaves initially sought to overturn\\nthe plan in its entirety, he changed his position\\nduring the appeal.

As to equitable\\n\\n\\x0c13\\nmootness, he did not question either the Third\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s formulation of the standard or the validity\\nof the doctrine more generally. Appellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Br. 4754. To the contrary, he accepted the equitable\\nmootness test articulated by the Third Circuit in\\nSemCrude, L.P., 728 F.3d 314 (3d Cir. 2013) and\\nquoted above (supra at 3), and asked that the court\\napply it in his favor because the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual payout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nhe requested would neither harm third parties nor\\nfatally scramble the plan. Id. Thus, the only\\nquestion before the Third Circuit was the validity of\\nthe lone \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual payout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d remedy Hargreaves\\nsought. Pet.

Judge Krause\\nconcurred only in the judgment, finding that she\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould confine equitable mootness to the narrow role\\nenvisioned by our precedents, reach the merits\\nquestions outlined above, and ultimately resolve this\\nappeal in favor of the reorganized debtors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n19.\\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION\\nI.\\n\\nTHIS CASE IS NOT A PROPER VEHICLE\\nTO REVISIT EQUITABLE MOOTNESS.\\n\\nEven if this Court were inclined to undo forty\\nyears of jurisprudence and reject the equitable\\nmootness doctrine, this case would not be the vehicle\\nto do it.

Even Judge Krause, who\\nraised concerns, sua sponte, about the effects of\\n\\n\\x0c15\\nequitable mootness on the development of\\nbankruptcy jurisprudence, did not raise or address\\nthe question presented here: whether equitable\\nmootness conflicts with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abstention cases\\n(or any of the other cases cited by Hargreaves).

The Equitable Mootness Doctrine Is\\nNarrow and Does Not Inhibit\\nDevelopment of the Law.\\nThe past forty years of equitable mootness\\njurisprudence have allowed the courts to test,\\nchallenge, and refine the doctrine.

The doctrine that Hargreaves now\\nseeks to overturn, however, is no longer the hazy, illdefined teaching of the majority in Continental. In\\nresponse to the concerns expressed in the dissent of\\nthen-Judge Alito in Continental, and those expressed\\nby some other judges and commentators, the Third\\nCircuit and other courts have honed and narrowed\\nthe doctrine of equitable mootness.\\nThis honing is evident from a comparison of the\\ntest initially adopted by the Third Circuit in\\nContinental and the test applied by the Third Circuit\\nin this case. Like other circuits, the Third Circuit\\nnow looks not only to whether substantial\\nconsummation has occurred (and therefore, whether\\nreversal of the entire plan would prove inequitable\\nor impractical), but also whether any relief could be\\nfashioned in the event that the appeal were to be\\nsuccessful. As the Third Circuit here explained:\\nThere is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrong presumption that appeals from\\nconfirmation orders of reorganization plans . . . need\\nto be decided[,]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d . . . and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca court may fashion\\nwhatever relief is practicable instead of declining\\nreview simply because full relief is not available.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPet.

[and]\\n[t]he party seeking to invoke the doctrine bears the\\nburden of overcoming the strong presumption that\\nappeals from confirmation orders of reorganization\\nplans\\xe2\\x80\\x94even those not only approved by confirmation\\nbut implemented thereafter (called \\xe2\\x80\\x98substantial\\nconsummation\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or simply \\xe2\\x80\\x98consummation\\xe2\\x80\\x99)\\xe2\\x80\\x94need to\\nbe decided.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citation omitted).\\nAccordingly, Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suggestions that the\\ndoctrine is \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctragic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Pet. 19) and has \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstunted\\nbankruptcy law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Pet. 24) are overwrought and\\nunfounded. The Third Circuit and other courts\\nrepeatedly have enforced the mandate to use\\nequitable mootness as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscalpel,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d applying it in\\nlimited cases where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is not only as difficult to\\nrestore an estate to the status quo ante\\nconsummation as it is to gather all the feathers from\\nthe proverbial pillow, [but] it is also a crushing\\nexpense to the reorganized entity and its\\nshareholders.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Tribune Media, 799 F.3d at 288\\n(Ambro, J., concurring).15 Accordingly, in the vast\\nmajority of bankruptcy cases, courts of appeals do\\nSee also In re Chateaugay Corp., 10 F.3d 944, 952 (2d Cir.\\n1993) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSubstantial consummation of a reorganization plan is a\\nmomentous event, but it does not necessarily make it\\nimpossible or inequitable for an appellate court to grant\\neffective relief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); SemCrude, 728 F.3d at 320 (explaining that\\nequitable mootness is considered where \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgranting relief on\\nappeal [is] almost certain to produce a \\xe2\\x80\\x98perverse\\xe2\\x80\\x99 outcome\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98chaos in the bankruptcy court\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from a plan in tatters and/or\\nsignificant \\xe2\\x80\\x98injury to third parties.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) (citations omitted); Paige,\\n584 F.3d at 1347\\xe2\\x80\\x9348 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppellees have failed to present any\\nreason for this court to suspect that reversal of the Joint Plan\\nwould create an unmanageable situation for the bankruptcy\\ncourt.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n15\\n\\n\\x0c27\\nreach the merits and do develop bankruptcy law\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\ndespite equitable mootness.\\nMoreover, as the Third Circuit majority explained\\nhere, an aggrieved creditor can always seek a stay of\\nthe confirmation order in the district court.

App. 13-14 n.7; see In re Revel AC, Inc., 802 F.3d\\n558, 567 (3d Cir. 2015) (holding that an order\\ndenying request for a stay is final and appealable\\nwhen \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe upshot of declining [the] stay request is to\\nprevent [the movant] from obtaining a full airing of\\nits issues on appeal and a decision on the merits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nBut in this case, Hargreaves chose not to appeal the\\ndenial of his stay request by the district court,\\npaving the way for consummation to move forward.\\nFinally, it is important to note that, even where\\nequitable mootness applies, appellate courts can and\\ndo nevertheless reach the merits of the bankruptcy\\nissues. For example, in In re Metromedia Fiber\\nNetwork, Inc., 416 F.3d 136 (2d Cir. 2005), a Second\\nCircuit panel analyzed the merits of an appeal before\\nequitable mootness, reasoning that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause\\nequitable mootness bears only upon the proper\\nremedy, and does not raise a threshold question of\\nour power to rule, a court is not inhibited from\\nconsidering the merits before considering equitable\\nmootness.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 144 (citation omitted); Behrmann\\nv. Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Heritage Found., 663 F.3d 704, 713 n.3 (4th\\n\\n\\x0c28\\nCir. 2011) (same).16 In this way, too, the presence of\\nequitable mootness concerns do not, as Hargreaves\\nsuggests, automatically consign bankruptcy merits\\nissues to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproverbial dustbin\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Pet. 22) and\\nprevent development of bankruptcy law.\\nIII. EQUITABLE MOOTNESS IS CONSISTENT\\nWITH THIS COURT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S CASES.\\nLeaving aside the vehicle problems and the lack\\nof any circuit split, the equitable mootness doctrine\\nis, in fact, entirely consistent with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases\\non abstention, jurisdiction, and standing relied on in\\nthe Petition (3-6, 20-23). As Hargreaves rightly\\nobserves (Pet. 3-4), the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abstention cases\\nprimarily concern circumstances in which federal\\ncourts should abstain from ruling in favor of a state.\\nSee, e.g., New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v. Council of\\nCity of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 368 (1989)\\n(holding that \\xe2\\x80\\x9conly exceptional circumstances justify\\na federal court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s refusal to decide a case in deference\\nto the States\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Those federalism concerns are\\nirrelevant here.\\n\\nIf Hargreaves is arguing that appellate courts must reach\\nmerits issues first, even when there is no feasible remedy, see\\nPet. 29 (suggesting \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccourts normally decide the merits of the\\nclaims first, then tailor any relief as appropriate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d), that would\\nimpose an unnecessarily \\xe2\\x80\\x9crigid order[] of battle.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pearson v.\\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 224 (2009) (internal quotation marks\\nand citation omitted). Practically, it would force overburdened\\ndistrict and appellate courts to labor through every merits issue\\nin every bankruptcy appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x94no matter how spurious\\xe2\\x80\\x94only to\\nthen pronounce that the appeal must be rejected on equitable\\nmootness grounds.\\n16\\n\\n\\x0c29\\nNor is this case anything like those in which an\\nappellate court refused to entertain jurisdiction at\\nall, Mata v. Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, 149 (2015) (finding\\nthat the Fifth Circuit had improperly dismissed an\\nappeal from a decision of the Board of Immigration\\nAppeals for lack of jurisdiction), or imposed\\nprudential requirements under the guise of\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cstanding.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lexmark Int\\xe2\\x80\\x99l, Inc. v. Static Control\\nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 128 (2014) (finding\\nthat a court \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccannot limit a cause of action that\\nCongress has created merely because \\xe2\\x80\\x98prudence\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\ndictates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nWhile Hargreaves strains to make\\nequitable mootness fit these cases, primarily citing\\nthe uncontroversial maxim that \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca federal court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nobligation to decide a case is \\xe2\\x80\\x98virtually unflagging,\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSprint Commc\\xe2\\x80\\x99ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 77\\n(2013), the fact is that the Third Circuit here did\\ntake \\xe2\\x80\\x9cjurisdiction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d over his appeal and decided this\\ncase by finding there was no relief it could provide\\nhim\\xe2\\x80\\x94thus, rejecting his appeal. That is within the\\nmainstream of this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases.\\nThis Court has \\xe2\\x80\\x9clong supported the proposition\\nthat federal courts lack the authority to abstain from\\nthe exercise of jurisdiction that has been conferred.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nNew Orleans Pub. Serv., 491 U.S. at 358. At the\\nsame time, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprinciple does not eliminate . . . and\\nthe categorical assertions based upon it do not call\\ninto question, the federal courts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 discretion in\\ndetermining whether to grant certain types of\\nrelief\\xe2\\x80\\x94a discretion that was part of the common-law\\nbackground against which the statutes conferring\\njurisdiction were enacted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 359.\\nAt its most basic level, equitable mootness simply\\nis an application of the principle that a court will not\\n\\n\\x0c30\\ndo harm to innocent third parties in order to grant\\nequitable relief to a claimant before it. It is a\\ndoctrine that does not seek to restrain the power or\\nthe jurisdiction of the court, but rather to prevent\\nthe imposition of relief that would be fundamentally\\ninequitable. See Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for\\nPuerto Rico, 987 F.3d at 182 (concluding that this\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s abstention doctrines are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinapplicable here\\n[in an equitable mootness context], where the issue\\nat hand turns not on jurisdiction but on the merits of\\nwhat is in form and substance a request for\\nequitable relief\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nAs noted above, and as this Court repeatedly has\\nheld, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe proceedings of bankruptcy courts are\\ninherently proceedings in equity,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Katchen v. Landy,\\n382 U.S. 323, 336 (1966), and the general rules of\\nequity apply to bankruptcy proceedings. See Loc.\\nLoan Co. v.

First State Bank of\\nVienna, S.D., 21 F.2d 936, 938 (8th Cir. 1927)).\\nEquitable relief \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis not a matter of absolute right to\\neither party; but a matter resting in the discretion of\\nthe court, to be exercised upon a consideration of all\\nthe circumstances of each particular case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Willard\\nv. Tayloe, 75 U.S. 557, 560 (1869). It, therefore, is\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwell settled that the imposition of an equitable\\nremedy must not itself work an inequity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Van\\nWagner Advert. Corp. v. S & M Enters., 67 N.Y.2d\\n186, 195 (App. Div. 1986).\\n\\n\\x0c31\\nHere, the relief requested by Hargreaves not only\\nwould work an inequity on those who relied on the\\nfinality of Nuverra\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plan of reorganization, but, as\\ndetermined by the Third Circuit, would violate\\napplicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. A\\ncourt cannot use its jurisdiction to grant relief that\\nwould violate the law. As this Court said in Mata, if\\nthe law \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprecludes [the plaintiff] from getting the\\nrelief he seeks, then the right course is to take\\njurisdiction over the case, explain why that is so, and\\naffirm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 576 U.S. at 149-50. That is exactly what the\\nThird Circuit did here.\\nBecause equitable mootness, particularly as now\\napplied in the Third Circuit and elsewhere, is a\\nlimited application of longstanding equitable\\nprinciples and consistent with the cases cited by\\nHargreaves, the Court has no need to consider the\\nquestion presented, and should deny the petition.\\nCONCLUSION\\nFor the foregoing reasons, the petition should be\\ndenied.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nFREDRIC SOSNICK\\nWILLIAM HOLSTE\\nJACOB S.

Indeed,\\nrespondents contend that all the courts of appeals that\\nhear bankruptcy cases have adopted some version of\\nequitable mootness. BIO 21\\xe2\\x80\\x9323. Moreover, although\\ndissenting and concurring opinions have criticized the\\ndoctrine for 20 years, there is no sign of any en banc\\ncourt of appeals overturning it. Simply put, there is no\\nreason for this Court to wait any longer to address the\\ndoctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s validity.\\nInstead, the most that can be hoped for going forward is a case in which equitable mootness prevents a\\ncourt of appeals from reaching a significant undecided\\nquestion of bankruptcy law, and in which a dissenting\\nor concurring opinion criticizes the lower courts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 continued adherence to the doctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x94precisely as happened\\nhere: the Third Circuit majority refused to address the\\nmerits of petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s argument that \\xe2\\x80\\x9chorizontal gifting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1 violates the Bankruptcy Code\\xe2\\x80\\x99s requirement of\\n1\\n\\nBroadly speaking, \\xe2\\x80\\x9chorizontal gifting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is the practice of allowing senior creditors to collude with the debtor to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some\\nof the recovery those creditors could otherwise demand to one or\\nmore classes of more junior creditors, in order to secure some\\n\\n\\x0c2\\nequal treatment of similarly situated creditors. It did\\nso expressly because of equitable mootness, and Judge\\nKrause directly criticized that doctrine in her separate\\nopinion. This case, in other words, is an ideal vehicle\\nfor addressing the foundational validity of equitablemootness abstention.\\nA. Forfeiture Presents No Vehicle Problem.\\nIt is specious for respondents to argue that the discretionary doctrine of forfeiture would bar the Court\\nfrom using this ideal vehicle to review the equitablemootness doctrine.\\nRespondents contend that Mr. Hargreaves should\\nnot be allowed to argue the invalidity of equitable\\nmootness before this Court without having done so before the Third Circuit panel. BIO 6, 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9316. But this\\nCourt has frequently recognized that its settled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpractice permits review of an issue not pressed [in the court\\nof appeals] as long as it has been passed upon.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Lebron\\nv. Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l R.R. Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 379 (1995);\\naccord, e.g., United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, 41\\n(1992). This case fits that mold: the panel below followed circuit precedent and applied equitable mootness, while Judge Krause objected to the doctrine in\\n\\nbenefit (e.g., a vote in favor of the reorganization plan) from those\\njunior creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x94and thereby further strengthen the plan sponsors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to steamroll any dissenting creditors during the planapproval process. See generally Bruce A. Markell, The Clock\\nStrikes Thirteen: The Blight of Horizontal Gifting, 38 No. 12 BLLNL 1 (Dec. 2018).\\n\\n\\x0c3\\nher separate opinion. The issue this Court will review\\nwas directly passed on by the Third Circuit panel.\\nIt would have been pointless, moreover, for petitioner to ask the panel to reject the equitable-mootness\\ndoctrine because the panel was bound by Third Circuit\\nprecedent to apply it. Petitioner raised in the Third\\nCircuit the issues that that court had authority to address, and it is raising in this Court the issue that this\\nCourt has authority to address. Cf. Carr v. Saul, 141\\nS. Ct. 1352, 1361 (2021) (in the administrative-law\\ncontext: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]t makes little sense to require litigants to\\npresent claims to adjudicators who are powerless to\\ngrant the relief requested. Such a vain exercise will\\nrarely protect administrative agency authority or promote judicial efficiency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (cleaned up)).\\nFinally, as respondents note, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cchief \\xe2\\x80\\x9d reason for\\nobserving forfeiture rules at the certiorari stage \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis the\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s need for a properly developed record on appeal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BIO 14. Here, there is no shortcoming in the record, and respondents do not even attempt to identify\\none. The multiple opinions of the panel fully flesh out\\nthe issue. Nor is it foreseeable that any future court of\\nappeals opinion will address the issue at any greater\\nlength, since, as respondents emphasize, all panels in\\nall circuits are bound by precedent to apply the doctrine.2\\n\\n2\\n\\nThe Eighth Circuit appears to be the last to have fallen in\\nline, having done so only in August 2021. See FishDish, LLP v.\\nVeroBlue Farms USA, Inc. (In re VeroBlue Farms USA, Inc.), 6\\nF.4th 880, 884 (8th Cir. 2021) (endorsing equitable mootness but\\nexpressing reservations based on the fact that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvoking this\\ndoctrine often results in \\xe2\\x80\\x98the refusal of the Article III courts to\\n\\n\\x0c4\\nB. Respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Mootness Argument Is Not\\nEven Colorable.\\nRespondents fall back on an implausible contention that the case is moot in the genuine, constitutional\\nsense. That is plainly wrong. Mootness occurs only\\nwhen some development causes the parties to lose any\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconcrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the\\nlitigation,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is impossible for a court to\\ngrant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing\\nparty.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161\\n(2016). Nothing remotely like that has happened here.\\nThe concrete interest Mr. Hargreaves has is in recovering money from Nuverra. He continues to claim he is\\nowed that money, and Nuverra continues not to pay it.\\nAs the Court has noted, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing so shows a continuing\\nstake in a dispute\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outcome as a demand for dollars\\nand cents.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mission Prod. Holdings, Inc. v. Tempnology,\\nLLC, 139 S. Ct. 1652, 1660 (2019) (citation omitted).\\nThat is what Mr. Hargreaves is demanding.\\nStripped of the inapt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconstitutional mootness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d label, respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 real argument seems to be that the\\nThird Circuit did not dismiss Mr. Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal\\nunder the equitable-mootness doctrine but, instead,\\nmade a merits determination that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual payout\\xe2\\x80\\x9d remedy he seeks is not available under the Bankruptcy Code. See BIO 5\\xe2\\x80\\x936, 18.3 Thus, according to\\nentertain a live appeal over which they indisputably possess statutory jurisdiction\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting In re Cont\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Airlines, 91 F.3d 553, 571\\n(3d Cir. 1996) (Alito, J., dissenting))).\\n3\\nRespondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ultimate goal appears to be the creation of a\\nclassic heads-I-win-tails-you-lose scenario: an individual creditor\\n\\n\\x0c5\\nrespondents, anything the courts say about equitable\\nmootness in this case is a mere \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvisory proclamation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BIO 17\\xe2\\x80\\x9318.\\nContrary to respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 characterization, the\\nCourt of Appeals expressly \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconclude[d] that the District Court correctly determined that Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal is equitably moot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 2\\xe2\\x80\\x933; id., at 14. Indeed,\\nits entire opinion was addressed to a single question:\\nwas Mr. Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal equitably moot? See Pet.\\nApp. 8\\xe2\\x80\\x939. In answering that question, the court concluded that ordering Nuverra to pay Mr. Hargreaves\\nwould require ordering it to pay other members of his\\nclass of creditors as well. Pet. App. 14.4 The Third Circuit did not hold that this relief would require revoking\\nthe reorganization plan. Compare BIO 4\\xe2\\x80\\x935, 17. Nor did\\nit say that Mr. Hargreaves had forfeited or waived it.\\nSee Pet. App. 14. Instead, the panel majority held that\\nit believed ordering such relief \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwould fatally scramble\\nlike Mr. Hargreaves can never seek appellate review of an unfair\\ndiscrimination ruling because the Code prohibits it, and a broader\\nclass can never seek review of such a ruling because a decision\\nordering relief to the entire objecting class would fatally scramble\\nthe plan\\xe2\\x80\\x94and therefore be equitably moot. See Pet. App. 17 (opinion of Judge Krause warning of this problem).\\n4\\nEven though Mr. Hargreaves argued (and continues to\\nmaintain) that the courts can order payment to him without also\\nordering it to other members of his class of creditors who did not\\nappeal the confirmation order, the panel considered both individual and classwide redress\\xe2\\x80\\x94as it was required to do under Third\\nCircuit law. See Tribune Media Co. v. Aurelius Capital Mgmt.,\\nL.P. (In re Tribune Media Co.), 799 F.3d 272, 278 (3d Cir. 2015)\\n(court facing an equitable mootness challenge must \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfashion\\nwhatever relief is practicable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n\\x0c6\\nthe plan,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and so it declared the appeal to be equitably\\nmoot. Ibid.\\nAccordingly, if this Court grants review, vacates\\nthe decision below, and remands for a determination of\\nthe merits, Mr. Hargreaves will be able to seek the relief that the panel majority rejected as barred by its\\nequitable-mootness precedents. See Pet. App. 14.\\nThis case is therefore not moot, and the question\\npresented is ripe for this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review.\\nII.\\n\\nREVIEW IS WARRANTED, NOT DUE TO A\\nCIRCUIT SPLIT, BUT BECAUSE OF THE\\nPROFOUND CONFLICT BETWEEN EQUITABLE MOOTNESS AND THIS COURT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S\\nPRECEDENTS.\\n\\nRespondents raise two arguments why the question presented does not warrant certiorari: (1) there is\\nno split in the circuits on the validity of equitable mootness, BIO 19\\xe2\\x80\\x9324; and (2) equitable mootness is, in respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 view, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsistent with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBIO 28\\xe2\\x80\\x9331. Neither argument holds water.\\nFirst, the certworthiness of Mr. Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Petition does not rest on the existence of a circuit split but\\nrather on the clear and palpable conflict between the\\nlower-court decisions embracing equitable mootness\\nand this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedents on federal jurisdiction and\\nabstention. Pet. 20\\xe2\\x80\\x9324; see also Pet. 3\\xe2\\x80\\x9311. Thus, although respondents are correct that every circuit to\\nconsider the question has held that Article III courts\\n\\n\\x0c7\\ncan sometimes abstain from hearing live bankruptcy\\nappeals on equitable-mootness grounds,5 that fact only\\nstrengthens the need for certiorari, since the chance of\\na self-correction has by now diminished to the point of\\nnonexistence. Review in this Court is the only feasible\\nrecourse that remains.\\nMoreover, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe doctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s widespread acceptance,\\nstanding alone, does not establish its validity. After all,\\nthe system of bankruptcy adjudication struck down in\\nStern [v. Marshall, 564 U.S. 462 (2011),] had been\\nunanimously upheld by district courts and courts of\\nappeals.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re One2One Commc\\xe2\\x80\\x99ns, LLC, 805 F.3d 428,\\n449 (3d Cir. 2015) (Krause, J., concurring).\\nSecond, respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 argument that equitable\\nmootness \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis consistent with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BIO\\n28, is flatly wrong and rests on a mischaracterization\\nof the doctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contours and application in the lower\\ncourts.\\nRespondents argue that the lower courts are not,\\nin fact, applying an abstention doctrine when they declare a case to be equitably moot, but are, instead,\\nsimply undertaking a remedy-focused merits analysis.\\nBIO 28 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe equitable mootness doctrine is, in fact, entirely consistent with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cases on abstention,\\n5\\n\\nWhile the circuits agree that the doctrine exists, the lack of\\nany principled basis for it has generated considerable confusion\\nin the courts. As the amici bankruptcy professors point out (Br. at\\n15\\xe2\\x80\\x9317), the courts of appeals diverge widely about when equitable-mootness abstention is proper, how courts should decide\\nwhether a particular case is equitably moot, and even who bears\\nthe burden of proof on the equitable-mootness inquiry.\\n\\n\\x0c8\\njurisdiction, and standing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); BIO 30 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt, therefore, is\\nwell settled that the imposition of an equitable remedy\\n[in a bankruptcy case] must not itself work an inequity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (cleaned up)).\\nBut even a cursory review of the circuits\\xe2\\x80\\x99 equitable-mootness decisions belies that description. As the\\nPetition explained, the courts of appeals describe equitable mootness as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca judicially-created doctrine of abstention,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Drivetrain, LLC v. Kozel (Abengoa Bioenergy\\nBiomass of Kan., LLC), 958 F.3d 949, 955 (10th Cir.\\n2020), and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca judge-made abstention doctrine,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In re\\nSemcrude, LP, 728 F.3d 314, 317 (3d Cir. 2013); Harkey\\nv. Grobstein (In re Point Ctr. Fin., Inc.), 957 F.3d 990,\\n1002 (9th Cir. 2020), that \\xe2\\x80\\x9callows courts to abstain from\\nappeals,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d New Indus., Inc. v. Byman (In re Sneed Shipbuilding, Inc.), 916 F.3d 405, 408 (5th Cir. 2019).\\nThe lower courts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 judgments match their descriptions: when they find an appeal equitably moot, they\\ndo not affirm the bankruptcy court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confirmation order but rather dismiss the appeal. See, e.g., In re City\\nof Detroit, 838 F.3d 792, 795 (6th Cir. 2016); In re Villaje\\ndel Rio, Ltd., 283 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 263, 265 (5th Cir. 2008)\\n(when \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitable mootness exists,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappeal must be\\ndismissed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). That pattern held true here. The District\\nCourt, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cruling the appeal equitably moot, dismissed it,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nand the Third Circuit affirmed that dismissal. Pet.\\nApp. 6, 14.\\nThis refusal to exercise jurisdiction is exactly like\\nthe conduct this Court has repeatedly condemned. See\\nMata v. Lynch, 576 U.S. 143, 150 (2015) (reviewing\\n\\n\\x0c9\\ncourt should have resolved the case by deciding the\\nmerits of the equitable issue, rather than refusing\\njurisdiction); Lexmark Int\\xe2\\x80\\x99l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 125\\xe2\\x80\\x93127 (2014) (impermissible for court to decline to entertain appeal for\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cprudential\\xe2\\x80\\x9d reasons); New Orleans Pub. Serv., Inc. v.\\nCouncil of City of New Orleans, 491 U.S. 350, 358\\xe2\\x80\\x93359\\n(1989) (court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscretion in determining whether to\\ngrant certain types of relief \\xe2\\x80\\x9d did not give it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cauthority\\nto abstain from the exercise of jurisdiction that has\\nbeen conferred\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).6\\nIn short, by refusing to acknowledge\\xe2\\x80\\x94much less\\ndefend\\xe2\\x80\\x94the doctrine of equitable mootness as it actually exists, respondents all but concede its incompatibility with this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s precedents, see Pet. 3\\xe2\\x80\\x936, and\\nthus confirm the need for this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s review.\\nIII. EQUITABLE MOOTNESS DISTORTS BANKRUPTCY LAW AND PRACTICE.\\nAs just explained, the parties agree that equitable\\nmootness cannot stand as a jurisdictional rule. They\\ndisagree, if at all, only about whether and how the doctrine can be reformed into a merits inquiry in order to\\nremain viable. As this Court has frequently recognized,\\n6\\n\\nRespondents also argue that equitable mootness cannot be\\nan abstention doctrine because the federalism concerns that animate the recognized abstention doctrines are absent here. BIO 28.\\nThat is exactly backwards. As shown above, the federal courts do\\ntreat equitable mootness as an abstention doctrine; the absence\\nof any federalism concerns in Chapter 11 cases merely shows that\\nit is an illegitimate one. See Pet. 3\\xe2\\x80\\x9311, 20\\xe2\\x80\\x9324.\\n\\n\\x0c10\\nthe distinction between jurisdiction and merits manifestly matters.\\nFor one thing, courts and counsel alike are welltrained to address jurisdictional objections before addressing the merits of an appeal. Therefore, as long as\\ncourts persist in framing equitable mootness in jurisdictional terms, the doctrine will continue to impair\\nthe development of bankruptcy law, see Brief for Professors of Bankruptcy Law as Amici Curiae 7\\xe2\\x80\\x9315, foreclose the meaningful Article III review of bankruptcy\\ncourt decisions that Congress prescribed, id., at 3\\xe2\\x80\\x937,\\nhobble the development and predictability of bankruptcy law, id., at 7\\xe2\\x80\\x9313, and invite gamesmanship that\\ndistorts bankruptcy outcomes, id., at 13\\xe2\\x80\\x9315.\\nRespondents offer no persuasive response. They\\nprotest that equitable mootness \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdoes not inhibit development of the law,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d BIO 25, but the only cases they\\ncan muster for that proposition are decisions that developed the law of equitable mootness.7 And they say\\nalmost nothing in response to the arguments raised\\nboth in the Petition (at 24\\xe2\\x80\\x9332) and the Law Professors\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\namicus brief (at 7\\xe2\\x80\\x9315) concerning the myriad ways in\\nwhich equitable mootness at best stymies the development of the law and at worst has been weaponized to\\n7\\n\\nRespondents seem to believe that because (in their words)\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitable mootness jurisprudence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has been \\xe2\\x80\\x9choned and narrowed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in various ways over time, BIO 25, review of the doctrine\\nis not warranted. But none of that \\xe2\\x80\\x9choning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnarrowing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has\\nprovided a satisfactory statutory (or other doctrinal) basis for equitable mootness, and it is telling that respondents themselves do\\nnot even attempt to offer one.\\n\\n\\x0c11\\npreclude appellate review of plans of questionable legality.\\nRespondents also observe in passing that a court\\nmay consider remedy-focused issues before dismissing\\nan appeal as equitably moot. BIO 27. But that is little\\ncomfort. As Judge Krause observed here, such an approach still leaves \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother merits questions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d undecided.\\nPet. App. 16, 17. And as the Petition explains, the remedial inquiry itself is distorted when it is conducted\\nin isolation, without considering whether a legal wrong\\nhas occurred. Pet. 29\\xe2\\x80\\x9330. As a result, equitable mootness relegates \\xe2\\x80\\x9cessential attributes of judicial power\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nto non-Article-III bankruptcy judges rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x9cretain[ing such power] in the Art. III court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d N. Pipeline\\nConstr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 81\\n(1982).\\nFinally, it is no answer to suggest (as respondents\\ndo, BIO 27) that an objector may seek a stay of confirmation to preserve review. As the Petition explains (at\\n27\\xe2\\x80\\x9328), the lower courts routinely hold that the risk of\\nequitable mootness cannot support a stay, especially\\nwhen (as is almost always the case) the objector seeks\\nonly monetary relief. Against that backdrop, and\\ngiven the deferential standard of review that applies\\nto appeals of stay denials, respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 suggestion\\nthat parties in Mr. Hargreaves\\xe2\\x80\\x99s position could find\\nready vindication on appeal from such denials, see\\nBIO 27, is strained, to say the least. In any event, it\\nmakes no doctrinal sense to say that whether review\\nof a substantially consummated plan is equitably moot\\n\\n\\x0c12\\ndepends on whether the objector made an unsuccessful\\nattempt to seek a stay.\\n---------------------------------\\xe2\\x99\\xa6---------------------------------\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\nThis Court should grant certiorari.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nMARK D.

The district\\ncourt construed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as seeking relief\\nunder 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983 and dismissed the case,\\nassessing a strike against Mr. Rice for purposes of the\\nPrison Litigation Reform Act. Mr. Rice, still pro se,\\nappealed the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment. The named\\ndefendant, the Harris County Sheriff, did not file a\\nresponsive brief.\\nBefore the Fifth Circuit could rule on the appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nindeed, seven weeks before it ruled\\xe2\\x80\\x94Mr. Rice was\\ntransferred to Texas Department of Criminal Justice\\ncustody at the Gist State Jail in Beaumont, Texas, in\\norder to serve his sentence. Thus, his pretrial\\ndetention at the Harris County Jail was over, and his\\nclaim for release from that detention was moot. The\\nFifth Circuit, unaware of this development, issued a\\npublished opinion in which it construed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclaim as brought in habeas, and then held that habeas\\nwas unavailable for his claim. As the Fifth Circuit\\nrecognized, this decision created a circuit split with the\\nSixth Circuit.\\nAfter the Fifth Circuit issued its opinion but before\\nthe mandate issued, Mr. Rice retained counsel and\\nnotified the court that he had not been in Harris\\nCounty custody at the time it issued its opinion.\\nAccordingly, he indicated to the court of appeals, it\\nlacked jurisdiction to decide the case when it issued its\\nopinion. He therefore sought vacatur of the published\\nopinion and dismissal of the appeal. Respondent did\\nnot oppose the request.\\nNonetheless, without\\ni\\n\\n\\x0cexplanation, the court of appeals denied vacatur and\\ndismissal.\\nThe question presented is:\\nWhether the court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 judgment should be\\nvacated, where the appeal was moot at the time the\\nopinion issued because Petitioner two months earlier\\nhad been transferred from the pretrial detention that\\nwas the only subject of his case.\\nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING\\nPetitioner is Skyler Thomas Rice, formerly a pretrial\\ndetainee at the Harris County Jail in the custody of\\nthe Harris County Sheriff and now a prisoner at the\\nGist State Jail in the custody of the Texas Department\\nof Criminal Justice.\\nRespondent is the Sheriff of Harris County.\\nSTATEMENT OF RELATED PROCEEDINGS\\nRice v.

Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lawsuit challenged his pretrial\\ndetention at the Harris County Jail. Yet he was no\\nlonger detained there or in the custody of the\\nRespondent, the Harris County Sheriff, when the court\\nbelow ruled. When Mr. Rice informed the court of its\\nlack of jurisdiction, however, the court denied multiple\\nrequests to vacate its decision and dismiss the appeal,\\nwithout explanation\\xe2\\x80\\x94even though the Respondent did\\nnot oppose vacatur. Because the court below exceeded\\nits Article III authority, and then refused to vacate its\\ndecision and dismiss the appeal after learning of its\\nerror, Mr. Rice seeks this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention.\\nThe Fifth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, which created a circuit\\nsplit, was advisory on issuance. Under Article III, the\\ncourts have authority only to decide live cases or\\ncontroversies, and the decision issued by the court of\\nappeals came in a case that presented no such dispute.\\nMoreover, Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case became moot while it was on\\nappeal, also warranting vacatur (of both the court of\\nappeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decisions). Mr. Rice\\ntherefore respectfully requests that this Court grant\\ncertiorari, vacate the court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision, and\\nremand for vacatur of the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and\\ndismissal of the case without prejudice by the district\\ncourt.\\n\\n1\\n\\n\\x0cOPINIONS BELOW\\nThe court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion affirming the district\\ncourt (Pet. App. 34a-36a) is reported at 985 F.3d 1069.\\nThe court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision denying rehearing (Pet.\\nApp. 21a) is unreported. The court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision\\ndenying Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unopposed motion for vacatur and\\ndismissal (Pet. App. 4a) is unreported. The court of\\nappeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions denying Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unopposed\\nmotion to recall the mandate (Pet. App. 3a) and\\ndenying rehearing en banc as to that motion (Pet. App.\\n1a-2a) are likewise unreported.\\nThe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion (Pet. App. 41a-44a) is\\nunreported.\\nJURISDICTION\\nThe opinion affirming the district court was issued\\non February 2, 2021. The court of appeals denied: (i)\\nrehearing on March 11, 2021; (ii) Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unopposed\\nmotion for vacatur and dismissal on March 22, 2021;\\nand (iii) Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unopposed motion to recall the\\nmandate on April 16, 2021. The court of appeals\\ndenied rehearing en banc as to Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unopposed\\nmotion to recall the mandate on May 7, 2021.\\nThe Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\\n\\xc2\\xa7 1254(1).\\nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS\\nINVOLVED\\nArticle III, Section 2 of the United\\nConstitution delimits the scope of the\\njudiciary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority, including that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he\\nPower shall extend to all Cases, in Law and\\n\\n2\\n\\nStates\\nfederal\\njudicial\\nEquity,\\n\\n\\x0carising under this Constitution [and] the Laws of the\\nUnited States . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[n]o person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty,\\nor property, without due process of law . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSection 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the\\nConstitution provides, in relevant part, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnor shall any\\nState deprive any person of life, liberty, or property,\\nwithout due process of law . . . .\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE\\nIn April 2020, Mr. Rice was in pretrial custody at the\\nHarris County Jail. He sought his immediate release\\nfrom pretrial detention in two pro se filings, treated as\\ndistinct proceedings by the district court.\\nOne of the two cases docketed by the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclerk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office was a pro se petition for writ of habeas\\ncorpus or, alternatively, a request for injunctive relief.\\nRice v. Gonzalez, No. 4:20-cv-01356, Dkt. 1 (S.D. Tex.\\nApr. 15, 2020). That case was adjudicated by Judge\\nVanessa D. Gilmore, who denied the petition and\\ndismissed the case in August 2020. Rice v. Gonzalez,\\nNo. 4:20-cv-01356, 2020 WL 4569660 (S.D. Tex. Aug.\\n6, 2020). Mr. Rice did not appeal that decision.\\nThis petition concerns the second case, docketed and\\nadjudicated separately by the district court. This case\\nwas initiated by Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pro se memorandum of law\\nin support of a motion for a temporary restraining\\norder and preliminary injunction, intended to\\naccompany the habeas petition. The district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclerk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office treated it as a distinct matter and\\nassigned it to a separate judge, Judge David Hittner.\\nThe second case challenged Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial\\nconfinement in the Harris County Jail and sought\\n3\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9crelease . . . on his own recognizance for the pendency\\nof his criminal proceedings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 45a. His\\nunderlying claim was that his continued pretrial\\ndetention at the Harris County Jail violated the Fifth\\nand Fourteenth Amendments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Due Process Clauses.\\nPet. App. 45a-46a, 49a-51a. He alleged that he was at\\nincreased risk of a serious adverse health outcome\\nwere he to contract COVID-19 due to his underlying\\nhealth conditions and that his pretrial detention at the\\nHarris County Jail \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexposed [him] to a substantial risk\\nof serious harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 49a, 52a. In support of\\nthis contention, he highlighted specific risks he faced\\nbecause of the unsafe conditions at the Harris County\\nJail. Pet. App. 49a. Mr. Rice alleged that his ongoing\\npretrial detention demonstrated that the Harris\\nCounty Sheriff disregarded the risk that COVID-19\\nposed to Mr. Rice at the Harris County Jail. Pet. App.\\n52a-53a.\\nDistrict Judge Hittner construed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case as\\nbrought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983 and not habeas\\ncorpus. Pet. App. 42a-43a. On April 28, 2020, Judge\\nHittner dismissed the case and assessed a strike\\nagainst Mr. Rice for purposes of the Prison Litigation\\nReform Act. Pet. App. 44a. Mr. Rice then appealed\\npro se to the Fifth Circuit, which docketed his opening\\nbrief on October 1, 2020. Pet. App. 37a. The Sheriff of\\nHarris County did not file a brief before the Fifth\\nCircuit.\\nOn December 15, 2020, some seven weeks before the\\nFifth Circuit ruled on his case, Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s detention at\\nthe Harris County Jail came to an end. He had been\\nsentenced to incarceration by the state for possession\\nof controlled substances. The Texas Department of\\nCriminal Justice (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTDCJ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) therefore took custody of\\nhim for service of his sentence at the Gist State Jail in\\nBeaumont, Texas, where he remains to this day.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cOn February 2, 2021, unaware that Mr. Rice was no\\nlonger in the custody of the Harris County Sheriff at\\nthe Harris County Jail, the Fifth Circuit issued a\\npublished opinion affirming the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s denial\\nof relief. Pet. App. 34a-36a. The Fifth Circuit\\nconstrued Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as sounding in habeas and\\nconcluded that it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthus ha[d] jurisdiction over the\\ncase.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 35a. It mistakenly described Mr. Rice\\nas \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca detainee in the Harris County, Texas, jail\\nawaiting trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 34a. But as noted above, at\\nthe time of the decision, Mr. Rice was in fact not a\\ndetainee in the custody of the Harris County Sheriff\\nbut was instead incarcerated in TDCJ custody at the\\nGist State Jail. TDCJ was not a respondent in the\\ncase, and the case made no mention of, much less any\\nclaims regarding confinement at, the Gist State Jail.\\nThe Fifth Circuit ruled that habeas was not\\navailable as a vehicle to challenge Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial\\ndetention. Pet. App. 35a. It acknowledged that its\\npublished opinion created a circuit split with the Sixth\\nCircuit. Pet. App. 36a n.2 (noting divergence from\\nWilson v. Williams, 961 F.3d 829 (6th Cir. 2020)).\\nFollowing issuance of the opinion, Mr. Rice retained\\ncounsel, who promptly sought rehearing, bringing to\\nthe Fifth Circuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention that Mr. Rice had not been\\nin the custody of the Harris County Sheriff, the only\\nrespondent, when the opinion issued. Pet. App. 22a23a.\\nThe Fifth Circuit denied the petition for\\nrehearing in a one-sentence order without\\nexplanation. Pet. App. 21a. Through counsel, Mr. Rice\\nthen moved, unopposed, for vacatur of the opinion and\\ndismissal of the appeal as moot. Pet. App. 5a-20a. The\\ncourt of appeals denied that motion in a brief order,\\nwithout any explanation except a pincite to a federal\\ncourts treatise. Pet. App. 4a. Mr. Rice moved,\\nunopposed, to recall the mandate, but the court of\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cappeals denied that motion without explanation as\\nwell. Pet. App. 3a. He then sought en banc rehearing\\nof that motion, which the court also denied, again\\nwithout offering any rationale. Pet. App. 1a.\\nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\\nThis case was moot when the court of appeals\\ndecided it, and thus the court of appeals was without\\nArticle III jurisdiction to rule. Mr. Rice filed suit to\\nchallenge his pretrial detention by the Harris County\\nSheriff in the Harris County Jail, but by the time the\\ncourt of appeals ruled, Mr. Rice was no longer in\\npretrial detention, no longer in the Harris County Jail,\\nand no longer in the custody of the sole respondent, the\\nHarris County Sheriff. There was therefore no case or\\ncontroversy to be decided, and the court of appeals\\nlacked jurisdiction over the appeal.\\nThe court of appeals was initially unaware that it\\nlacked jurisdiction. But even after it learned that Mr.\\nRice had not been in pretrial detention at the Harris\\nCounty Jail at the time of its decision, it declined to\\nvacate its published opinion and dismiss the appeal on\\nfour occasions\\xe2\\x80\\x94even though Respondent did not\\noppose Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request. Because the case was moot\\nwhen it was decided, and remains moot, Mr. Rice\\ncannot seek review on the merits of the adverse ruling\\nof the district court or court of appeals. Where a\\ndispute has become moot while pending on appeal\\nthrough no fault of the party who would seek review,\\nthe proper disposition is to vacate the opinion that can\\nno longer be appealed. That is all the more necessary\\nhere, where the court below did not even have Article\\nIII jurisdiction to issue the opinion. Mr. Rice therefore\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0crequests that this Court grant certiorari, vacate the\\ncourt of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion, and remand. 1\\nHere, vacatur is justified for two independent\\nreasons. First, the decision below is an advisory\\nopinion, issued without Article III jurisdiction. Courts\\nare necessarily limited by Article III, and the court\\nbelow contravened those limits. Second, the fact that\\nMr. Rice cannot now seek review on the merits of the\\ndistrict court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or court of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions, due to the\\ncase\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mootness, independently warrants vacatur of\\nboth decisions. This rationale would apply even if the\\ncourt of appeals had had jurisdiction to issue the\\nunderlying decision in the first place, and the case had\\nbecome moot only thereafter.\\nSummary vacatur and remand are particularly\\nwarranted in this case as an exercise of this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsupervisory power. The court of appeals repeatedly\\nrefused to vacate the advisory opinion, creating a\\ncircuit split in this indisputably moot case. This\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention is needed to ensure compliance\\nwith the Article III limitations on the power of the\\nfederal judiciary.\\n\\n1 A finding of cert-worthiness is not a prerequisite to vacatur in\\nthese circumstances. See, e.g., Azar v. Garza, 138 S. Ct. 1790\\n(2018) (per curiam) (vacating judgment on an issue of first\\nimpression in the court of appeals without discussing whether\\ncertiorari would have been warranted); Stephen M. Shapiro et al.,\\nSupreme Court Practice \\xc2\\xa7 5.13, at 357\\xe2\\x80\\x9358 (10th ed. 2013). Mr.\\nRice notes, however, that the court below recognized that its\\ndecision created a circuit split as to whether claims seeking\\nimmediate release from incarceration or detention due to the\\ndanger of contracting COVID-19 are cognizable in habeas.\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cI. The Court of Appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Decision Exceeded Its\\nAuthority Under Article III Because the Case\\nWas Moot When the Court Ruled.\\nThe case was moot when the court of appeals issued\\nits opinion and entered judgment on February 2, 2021.\\nAt the time, the court erroneously believed that Mr.\\nRice was in pretrial detention at the Harris County\\nJail. Pet. App. 34a (describing Mr. Rice as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca detainee\\nin the Harris County, Texas, jail awaiting trial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). But\\nseven weeks earlier, in December 2020, Mr. Rice had\\nbeen sentenced and transferred to TDCJ custody to\\nserve his sentence. As a result, his pretrial detention\\nat the Harris County Jail was over. Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s habeas\\npetition sought release only from the Harris County\\nJail on his own recognizance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor the pendency of his\\ncriminal proceedings,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in light of the specific danger\\nposed by COVID-19 at the Harris County Jail. Pet.\\nApp. 45a. Because Mr. Rice was sentenced and the\\nstate took him into custody, he was no longer in the\\ncustody of the Respondent, the Harris County Sheriff,\\nand there was no case or controversy left for the Fifth\\nCircuit to adjudicate.\\nSince Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial\\ndetention at the Harris County Jail had ended, the\\ncourt of appeals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 jurisdiction over his habeas claim\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nover a controversy regarding \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe restraint of which\\n[the] petitioner complain[ed]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94had also ended. See Ex\\nparte Baez, 177 U.S. 378, 390 (1900) (emphasis added).\\nIt is universally recognized, including in the Fifth\\nCircuit, that once a petitioner who has sought habeas\\nrelief in the form of release from pretrial detention has\\nleft pretrial custody, the litigation is moot. See, e.g.,\\nPowers v.

E.g., Thompson v. Choinski, 525\\nF.3d 205, 209 (2d Cir. 2008) (transfer from state prison\\nto federal penitentiary mooted claim brought in\\nhabeas predicated on denial of kosher food and access\\nto law library at state prison). Transfer to another\\nplace of detention or release from detention moots a\\nclaim arising from the initial detention location. See,\\ne.g., id.; Thompson v. Smith, 719 F.2d 938, 940-41 (8th\\nCir. 1983) (per curiam) (transfer between prisons\\nmooted habeas claim predicated on harassment,\\nintimidation, and threats at original prison); Corgain\\nv.

The rule is simple: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen a prisoner is\\nmoved from a prison, his action will usually become\\nmoot as to\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the original place of confinement. Nelson\\nv. Heiss, 271 F.3d 891, 897 (9th Cir. 2001). 2\\nThere was no remaining controversy between Mr.\\nRice and the Harris County Sheriff on February 2,\\n2021, when the court of appeals ruled. Article III\\nrequires that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he parties must continue to have a\\npersonal stake in the outcome of the lawsuit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at all\\nstages of the proceedings, including on appeal. See\\nSpencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 7 (1998) (quoting Lewis\\nv. Cont\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, 477-78 (1990))\\n(internal quotation marks omitted). The Fifth Circuit\\ntherefore lacked jurisdiction to consider Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclaim on February 2, when it published its opinion and\\nentered judgment. On that basis alone, grant, vacatur,\\nand remand is warranted. 3\\nTransfer between facilities also moots a claim for injunctive\\nrelief hinging on the location in which an individual is held. E.g.,\\nNelson, 271 F.3d at 897; Rendelman v. Rouse, 569 F.3d 182, 186\\n(4th Cir. 2009) (explaining that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas a general rule, a prisoner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntransfer or release from a particular prison moots his claims for\\ninjunctive and declaratory relief with respect to his incarceration\\nthere\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); Edwards v. Johnson, 209 F.3d 772, 776 (5th Cir. 2000)\\n(claims for injunctive relief moot on transfer); Cooper v.

United States, 319 U.S. 41,\\n42 (1943) (per curiam). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt has long been settled that\\na federal court has no authority \\xe2\\x80\\x98to give opinions upon\\nmoot questions or . . . to declare principles or rules of\\nlaw which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case\\nbefore it.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United\\nStates, 506 U.S. 9, 12 (1992) (quoting Mills v.

Cooter & Gell v.\\nHartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 395-96 (1990) (citing, as examples,\\nattorneys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fees, costs, and contempt sanctions and holding that\\nRule 11 sanctions are also collateral). The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrike\\xe2\\x80\\x9d stood or fell\\nwith the merits of the appeal, just as would an attorneys\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fees\\naward. See Muwakkil v. Robinson, 143 F.

Madison Avenue Assocs., Inc., 926 F.3d 329, 333 (7th\\nCir. 2019) (Barrett, J.)). And a federal court has an\\nindependent duty to ensure that it has jurisdiction\\nover each case at the time it enters a decision, to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconfine[] itself to its constitutionally limited role of\\nadjudicating actual and concrete disputes, the\\nresolutions of which have direct consequences on the\\nparties involved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d United States v.

Ct. 1532, 1537 (2018).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9c[W]hen an appeal is moot before issuance of the\\nappellate court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion, it is appropriate to vacate\\nthat opinion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Versata Software, Inc. v. Callidus\\nSoftware, Inc., 780 F.3d 1134, 1135 (Fed. Cir. 2015)\\n(collecting cases from the Second, Fifth, Seventh, and\\nNinth Circuits). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit itself has\\nfollowed this procedure in other cases. For example,\\nin Shokeh v. Thompson, 375 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2004)\\n(per curiam), the Fifth Circuit vacated a published\\nopinion upon learning of facts that rendered the\\nappeal moot at the time of decision. In that case, the\\npro se petitioner challenged the requirement that his\\nrelease from detention be conditioned on posting a\\nbond. Id. at 351. Following publication of an opinion\\non the merits and prior to issuance of the mandate, the\\n12\\n\\n\\x0cFifth Circuit learned that the pro se appellant had\\nbeen released from detention almost two months\\nbefore the opinion issued. Id. When it learned that\\nthe case was moot on issuance of its initial opinion, the\\ncourt vacated the published opinion and the district\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and dismissed the action under\\nUnited States v. Munsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36, 39\\n(1950). Shokeh, 375 F.3d at 351-52. The same course\\nof action was, and is, required here.

The Underlying Decisions Also Require\\nVacatur Because Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Case Became\\nMoot While His Appeal Was Underway.\\nVacatur of the underlying district court and court of\\nappeals decisions is also appropriate now because the\\ncase became moot while Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal was\\nunderway.\\nVacatur is appropriate when a case becomes moot\\nwhile on appeal. Thus, when a case becomes moot\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhile on its way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to this Court, this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablished practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvacate the judgment below\\nand remand with a direction to dismiss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 39 & n.2 (1950); see also,\\ne.g., Mayorkas v. Innovation Law Lab, 594 U.S. __, __,\\nNo. 19-1212, 2021 WL 2520313 (U.S. June 21, 2021);\\nAzar v. Garza, 138 S. Ct. 1790, 1792 (2018) (per\\ncuriam); Trump v. Hawaii, 138 S.

This Court has followed that\\napproach in \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccountless cases,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Great W. Sugar Co. v.\\nNelson, 442 U.S. 92, 93 (1979) (per curiam), and it is\\nthe \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d procedure regarding mootness unless the\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0closing party itself chooses to moot the case, Camreta v.\\nGreene, 563 U.S. 692, 713 (2011).\\nThe rule providing for vacatur serves important\\npurposes: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA party who seeks review of the merits of\\nan adverse ruling, but is frustrated by the vagaries of\\ncircumstance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d . . . \\xe2\\x80\\x9cought not in fairness be forced to\\nacquiesce in the judgment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co.\\nv. Bonner Mall P\\xe2\\x80\\x99ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 (1994). Vacatur\\nunder Munsingwear is appropriate when, as here, the\\nparty seeking vacatur is not responsible for causing\\nthe case to become moot and vacating the lower court\\ndecision serves the doctrine\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equitable purposes. See,\\ne.g., U.S. Bancorp Mortg Co., 513 U.S. at 24\\xe2\\x80\\x9325.\\nThus, even where a court has jurisdiction when it\\nissues an opinion, as the district court did here,\\nvacatur is the appropriate remedy when the case\\nbecomes moot while on appeal through no fault of the\\nappealing party. Munsingwear directs that when an\\nappeal becomes moot, the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cestablished practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cvacate the judgment below and remand with a\\ndirection to dismiss.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 340 U.S. at 39. Such \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[v]acatur\\nis in order when mootness occurs through\\nhappenstance\\xe2\\x80\\x94circumstances not attributable to the\\nparties.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Arizonans for Off. Eng. v. Arizona, 520 U.S.\\n43, 71 (1997). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA party who . . . is frustrated by the\\nvagaries of circumstance[] ought not in fairness be\\nforced to acquiesce\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to an adverse decision. U.S.\\nBancorp Mortg. Co., 513 U.S. at 25. Because Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndispute with the Respondent has become moot as a\\nresult of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interposition of his criminal\\nsentencing and transfer out of pretrial detention, he\\nwas and is no longer able to pursue an appeal on the\\nmerits, and thus vacatur of the underlying opinions\\nand dismissal of the appeal is the appropriate\\ndisposition\\xe2\\x80\\x94and would be even if the court of appeals\\nhad had jurisdiction when it issued its opinion.\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cIV. Summary Vacatur and Remand is an\\nAppropriate Exercise of This Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nSupervisory Power.\\nSummary vacatur and remand is particularly\\nappropriate here as an exercise of this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbroad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9csupervisory power over the judgments of the lower\\nfederal courts.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Munsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40. This\\nCourt \\xe2\\x80\\x9cha[s] ample authority to control the\\nadministration of justice in the federal courts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\npursuant to its supervisory authority. Danforth v.\\nMinnesota, 552 U.S. 264, 289 (2008). Its \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupervisory\\npower over federal courts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d allows it to act \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto protect\\nthe integrity of the federal system.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Frazier v.\\nHeebe, 482 U.S. 641, 647 n.7 (1987). This Court\\nregularly deploys that power to ensure moot opinions\\ndo not lead to legal consequences. Munsingwear, 340\\nU.S. at 40-41; supra Section II.\\nHere, the use of the supervisory power is even more\\nappropriate than in a typical Munsingwear vacatur\\ncase. The court of appeals exceeded its authority\\nunder Article III in issuing its opinion, which created\\na circuit split on a novel and important question, and\\nit then refused multiple unopposed requests to correct\\nits own error. Only this Court can set matters right.\\nThe Fifth Circuit acknowledged that its decision in\\nthis moot case created a circuit split with the Sixth\\nCircuit. Rice, 985 F.3d at 1070 n.2. 4 It also has the\\npotential to intersect with a broader circuit split:\\nwhether habeas is an appropriate vehicle for\\nconditions of confinement claims as opposed to claims\\n4 The holding was also contrary to that of a prior Fifth Circuit\\npanel in an unpublished decision. See Cheek v. Warden of Fed.\\nMed. Ctr., 835 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 737, 739 (5th Cir. 2020) (unpublished)\\n(per curiam).\\n\\n16\\n\\n\\x0cregarding the fact or duration of confinement. This\\nCourt has left that question open for more than four\\ndecades. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 526 n.6 (1979);\\nsee, e.g., Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1031-32,\\n1036-38 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (acknowledging lack of\\nresolution\\nin\\nSupreme\\nCourt\\nprecedent,\\nacknowledging circuit split, and holding that habeas\\nwas an appropriate vehicle to challenge conditions of\\nconfinement); Spencer v. Haynes, 774 F.3d 467, 470-71\\n(8th Cir. 2014) (acknowledging circuit split and\\napplying circuit precedent in holding that habeas was\\nnot available as a vehicle to challenge conditions of\\nconfinement claims).\\nMoreover, the court of appeals below not only issued\\na published opinion in a moot case on this important\\nissue, but it did so in a pro se case, in which the\\nappellee never even filed a brief. Mr. Rice noted in his\\nbrief, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAppellant admits not being well lettered in the\\nlaw or the terms.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pet. App. 38a-39a. In fact, the\\nentirety of Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s briefing on the habeas question\\nconsisted of three sentences and a citation to an outof-circuit district court case. Id. The Fifth Circuit\\ntherefore decided a significant and contested question\\nwithout\\nmeaningful\\nbriefing\\nor\\nadversarial\\nproceedings, and then repeatedly refused multiple\\nunopposed requests to vacate its decision when it\\nlearned that it did not have jurisdiction at the time it\\nissued its original opinion.\\nThe failure of the court below even to engage with\\nthe question of its own jurisdiction further supports\\nvacatur. Mr. Rice brought mootness to the Fifth\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention four times. The Fifth Circuit\\nprovided no meaningful explanation of its denial of\\nvacatur and dismissal\\xe2\\x80\\x94only a citation to a section in\\nWright & Miller\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Federal Practice and Procedure\\n17\\n\\n\\x0ctreatise titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMootness: Doctrinal Foundations.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nPet. App. 4a.\\nThis case was indisputably moot at the time the\\ncourt of appeals rendered its decision. Even after it\\nlearned of this fact, the Fifth Circuit kept in place its\\nadvisory opinion creating a circuit split on a complex\\nand novel underlying question.\\nThis published\\nadvisory opinion has profound repercussions for\\nlitigants in the Fifth Circuit. Vacatur and remand for\\ndismissal are necessary to ensure continued\\ncompliance by the courts of appeals with Article III\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconstitutional limitations on their authority.\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cCONCLUSION\\nThe petition for writ of certiorari should be granted,\\nthe published opinion should be vacated, and the\\nmatter should be remanded to the court of appeals\\nwith instructions to vacate its judgment and remand\\nto the district court for vacatur of its April 28, 2020,\\norder of dismissal and final judgment, and for\\ndismissal of the case without prejudice.\\nRespectfully submitted,\\nDavid D.

See id.\\n\\n4a\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX D\\nUNITED STATES\\nCOURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH\\nCIRCUIT\\nNEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA\\nSKYLER THOMAS RICE, Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x94Appellant, versus\\nED GONZALEZ, SHERIFF OF HARRIS COUNTY,\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x94Appellee.\\nDocket No. 20-20263\\n[Filed March 17, 2021]\\nUNOPPOSED MOTION TO VACATE THE PANEL\\nOPINION AND DISMISS THE APPEAL AS MOOT\\nINTRODUCTION\\nAppellant Skyler Thomas Rice was no longer a\\npretrial detainee in custody at the Harris County Jail,\\nor otherwise in Harris County custody, at the time\\nthis Court entered judgment and issued its opinion.\\nIndeed, seven weeks before, Mr. Rice had been\\ntransferred to Texas Department of Criminal Justice\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTDCJ\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) custody in Beaumont, Texas, to serve his\\nsentence. This appeal of Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s habeas petition\\nseeking pretrial release from the Harris County Jail\\non his own recognizance during the pendency of Mr.\\nRice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s criminal proceedings was therefore moot. Mr.\\nRice accordingly seeks vacatur of the panel opinion\\nand dismissal of the appeal. Counsel has consulted\\nwith counsel for the Harris County Sheriff; the Sheriff\\n5a\\n\\n\\x0cis not opposed to this motion.\\nArticle III of the Constitution requires, for\\njurisdiction, a live case or controversy: it does not\\npermit the issuance of an advisory opinion. Because\\nthis appeal is moot and was moot when the panel\\nissued its decision, the published opinion must be\\nvacated, and the appeal must be dismissed.\\nControlling Supreme Court and Fifth Circuit\\nprecedent, and the constitutional limitation of the\\nfederal judiciary\\xe2\\x80\\x99s authority to the decision of actual\\ncases or controversies, compel this result. The Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nduty to inquire into the basis of its jurisdiction\\npersists throughout the litigation\\xe2\\x80\\x94including where\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cfacts which render the case moot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d come to the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nattention after the opinion issues and prior to issuance\\nof the mandate. United States v. Miller, 685 F.2d 123\\n(5th Cir. 1982) (per curiam). In such circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nincluding where the Court learns that a habeas\\npetitioner was no longer in pretrial custody when the\\nopinion issued, Shokeh v. Thompson, 375 F.3d 351 (5th\\nCir. 2004) (per curiam)\\xe2\\x80\\x94vacatur of the advisory\\nopinion is constitutionally required. Vacatur of the\\npublished opinion and the judgment below is also\\nappropriate under United States v. Munsingwear,\\nInc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). Because the litigation has\\nbecome moot due to the passage of time rather than\\nthe actions of the parties, the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion\\ncan never be reviewed by this Court.\\nFurther, on appeal, Mr. Rice sought to ensure that\\nthe dismissal of his case by the district court would not\\nresult in a strike against him under the Prison\\nLitigation Reform Act. This Court may and should, for\\nclarity, dispose of this matter ancillary to the\\nsubstantive litigation in its order of dismissal. But Mr.\\nRice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s concern regarding the strike does not save this\\n6a\\n\\n\\x0chabeas litigation seeking only release from Harris\\nCounty pretrial detention\\xe2\\x80\\x94relief a court can no longer\\nprovide\\xe2\\x80\\x94from mootness.\\nThis appeal was moot when the Court entered\\njudgment and issued its opinion. Mr. Rice could, at\\nthat time, no longer have been released from Harris\\nCounty pretrial custody\\xe2\\x80\\x94and so there was no\\neffective relief that a court could provide in this\\nlitigation. That information is now before this Court.\\nArticle III requires that the Court vacate its opinion\\nand dismiss this case.\\nBACKGROUND\\nWhen this Court entered judgment and issued its\\nopinion on February 2, 2021, it believed Appellant\\nSkyler Thomas Rice to be \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca detainee in the Harris\\nCounty, Texas, jail awaiting trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Doc. 515730526 at\\n1. But this was not so. Mr. Rice had at that time\\nalready been sentenced and, seven weeks before this\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision, transferred to TDCJ custody. In fact,\\nMr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mailing address on this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s docket is\\nthe Gist State Jail in Beaumont, Texas.\\nOn April 15, 2020, Mr. Rice filed this lawsuit\\nchallenging his pretrial confinement in the Harris\\nCounty Jail and seeking \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelease\\xe2\\x80\\xa6on his own\\nrecognizance for the pendency of his criminal\\nproceedings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Record on Appeal (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cROA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) 4. Mr. Rice\\nsought, as relief, either a writ of habeas corpus or an\\ninjunction ordering his immediate release. Id.\\nMr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underlying claim was that his continued\\nconfinement in pretrial detention at the Harris\\nCounty Jail violated the Fifth Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Due\\n7a\\n\\n\\x0cProcess Clause. Id. at 4-8. He alleged that he was at\\nincreased risk of a serious adverse outcome were he to\\ncontract COVID-19 due to his underlying health\\nconditions, including asthma and hypertension. Id. at\\n4, 6. He further alleged that his pretrial detention at\\nthe Harris County Jail \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexposed [him] to a substantial\\nrisk of serious harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 7. In support of this\\ncontention, he highlighted specific risks he faced\\nduring his detention at the Harris County Jail. Id. at\\n6-7; see also id. at 11 (Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s declaration). Finally,\\nMr. Rice alleged that his ongoing detention by Harris\\nCounty demonstrated that the Harris County Sheriff\\ndisregarded the risk that COVID-19 posed to Mr. Rice.\\nId. at 7-8.\\nOn April 28, 2020, the district court dismissed with\\nprejudice Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint, which it construed as\\na civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983\\nand not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Id. at\\n18, 20, 23. This appeal followed in May 2020. Id. at 24.\\nThis Court docketed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening brief in this\\nappeal on October 1. The Sheriff of Harris County did\\nnot file a brief in response.\\nMr. Rice was thereafter sentenced to state prison.\\nHe was transferred from Harris County Jail to TDCJ\\ncustody on December 15, 2020. Mr. Rice remains in\\nTDCJ custody at the Gist State Jail in Beaumont,\\nTexas. Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s address at the Gist State Jail is\\nlisted on this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s docket.\\nOn February 2, 2021, this Court issued a published\\nopinion in this litigation, affirming the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndenial of relief. Doc. 515730526 at 2. This Court\\nconstrued Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as sounding in habeas and\\nconcluded that the Court \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthus ha[d] jurisdiction over\\n8a\\n\\n\\x0cthe case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. This Court understood Mr. Rice to be, at\\nthe time the decision issued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca detainee in the Harris\\nCounty, Texas, jail awaiting trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1. At that\\ntime, however, Mr. Rice was incarcerated in TDCJ\\ncustody at the Gist State Jail.\\nARGUMENT\\nI.\\n\\nThis Appeal Was Moot When This Court\\nEntered Judgment on February 2, 2021.\\nA. The Appeal Was Moot Because Mr. Rice\\nWas No Longer in Pretrial Detention at\\nthe Harris County Jail on February 2.\\n\\nThis appeal was moot at the time of the panel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\noriginal decision, due to Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transfer to TDCJ\\ncustody. As described above, the panel appears to have\\nbelieved that Mr. Rice remained in pretrial detention\\nat the Harris County Jail on February 2, 2021, the\\ndate that this Court issued its opinion and entered\\njudgment. In fact, Mr. Rice had already been\\nsentenced and transferred to TDCJ custody pursuant\\nto that sentence, in December 2020. Mr. Rice, in his\\nhabeas petition, sought immediate release from the\\nHarris County Jail on his own recognizance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfor the\\npend[e]ncy of his criminal proceedings\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in light of the\\ndanger posed by COVID-19. ROA 4. Because Mr. Rice\\ncould no longer be released from the Harris County\\nJail when the panel entered judgment and issued its\\nopinion, there was no case or controversy for this\\nCourt to adjudicate.\\nFifth Circuit precedent is clear: once a petitioner\\nwho has sought habeas relief in the form of release\\nfrom pretrial detention has left pretrial custody, the\\n9a\\n\\n\\x0clitigation is moot. For example, in Powers v. Schwartz,\\n587 F.2d 783 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam), this Court\\nheld that because the petitioner was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno longer a\\npretrial detainee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her challenge to her pretrial\\ndetention\\npredicated\\non\\nthe\\nalleged\\nunconstitutionality of the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial bail scheme\\nfor certain detainees was moot. Id. at 783-84. Other\\nFifth Circuit decisions confirm that once pretrial\\ndetention ends, habeas claims stemming from that\\ndetention are moot. Fassier v. United States, 848 F.2d\\n1016, 1018 (5th Cir. 1988) (habeas request for pretrial\\nrelease moot following conviction); Yohey v. Collins,\\n985 F.2d 222, 228-29 (5th Cir. 1993) (pretrial habeas\\nclaims mooted by conviction, citing case in which\\nhabeas appeal regarding bail revocation was mooted\\nby conviction). 1 This is the rule in other circuits as\\nwell. E.g., Jackson v. Clements, 796 F.3d 841, 843 (7th\\nCir. 2015) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce Mr. Jackson was convicted, the\\nclaims concerning his pre-trial confinement became\\nmoot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); Thorne v. Warden, Brooklyn House of\\nDetention for Men, 479 F.2d 297, 299 (2d Cir. 1973)\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince Thorne is now held as a convicted defendant\\nrather than merely on a criminal charge not yet\\nNumerous unpublished Fifth Circuit decisions likewise\\nconfirm that pretrial habeas claims, including those seeking\\nrelease from pretrial detention, become moot following\\nconviction. United States v. Route, 65 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 508 (5th Cir. 2003)\\n(unpublished op.) (appeal of pretrial detention order mooted by\\nconviction); United States v. Heard, 192 F.3d 125 (unpublished\\nop.) (same); Henderson v. Criminal Dist. Ct. No. 3, 210 F.3d 366\\n(5th Cir. 2000) (unpublished op.) (habeas request for pretrial\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmediate release\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moot following conviction); Martinez v.\\nAtkinson, 678 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 218, 219 (5th Cir. 2017) (unpublished op.)\\n(habeas request for pretrial release mooted by conviction); United\\nStates v. Frazier, 220 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 294, 295 (5th Cir. 2007)\\n(unpublished op.) (same).\\n1\\n\\n10a\\n\\n\\x0cbrought to trial, the issue as to the legality of his\\ncontinued pretrial detention has been mooted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Mr.\\nRice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conviction and transfer out of pretrial detention\\nat the Harris County Jail, to incarceration by TDCJ to\\nserve his sentence, mooted his case.\\nThe Fifth Circuit has likewise held that transfer to\\nanother place of detention\\xe2\\x80\\x94even where such transfer\\nis not between pretrial detention and post-conviction\\nincarceration, and between detention systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94moots\\nclaims that arise based on the initial location of\\ndetention, including those brought in habeas.\\nHernandez v. Garrison, 916 F.2d 291 (5th Cir. 1990),\\nfor instance, held that claims brought in habeas\\nregarding overcrowding, denial of medical treatment,\\nand law library access at a particular federal prison\\nbecame moot on transfer to a different prison. Id. at\\n293. This logic applies a fortiori to Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transfer\\nfrom pretrial detention at the Harris County Jail, in\\nthe custody of the Harris County Sheriff, to\\nincarceration at a state prison, in the custody of TDCJ.\\nCf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, 434-35 (2004)\\n(holding that the immediate custodian is the\\nappropriate respondent in habeas litigation).\\nIn sum, because Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial detention at the\\nHarris County Jail had ended, the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jurisdiction\\nover his habeas claim\\xe2\\x80\\x94over a controversy regarding\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe restraint of which [the] petitioner complains\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nhad ended as well when the opinion issued. Ex parte\\nBaez, 177 U.S. 378, 390 (1900) (emphasis added).\\nThere is no remaining controversy between Mr. Rice\\nand the Harris County Sheriff, and there was no such\\ncontroversy on February 2. After his sentencing and\\nhis transfer to TDCJ custody in December 2020, Mr.\\nRice could no longer be released from the Harris\\n11a\\n\\n\\x0cCounty Jail; he could no longer be released for the\\npendency of his (now-decided) criminal proceedings;\\nand he was (and is) no longer in the custody of the\\nHarris County Sheriff. Whether a medically\\nvulnerable pretrial detainee requires release in light\\nof any heightened risk posed by COVID-19 at the\\nHarris County Jail is now no more material to Mr.\\nRice than to the general public. See id. (explaining\\nthat because the habeas petitioner was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno longer a\\npretrial detainee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d she lacked \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca personal stake in the\\noutcome of the controversy as to assure\\xe2\\x80\\xa6concrete\\nadverseness\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186,\\n204 (1962))). And this has been true since December\\n15, 2020. Had Mr. Rice on February 2 filed a habeas\\npetition seeking immediate release pretrial on his own\\nrecognizance from the Harris County Jail, the petition\\nwould have been dismissed\\xe2\\x80\\x94due to the lack of a\\ngenuine adversarial controversy or available relief.\\nThis Court therefore lacks jurisdiction to consider\\nMr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim and lacked such jurisdiction on\\nFebruary 2, when it entered judgment. Powers, 587\\nF.2d at 784. The appeal is moot. 2\\n\\n2 This Court construed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as sounding in habeas.\\nWere the Court to construe it as a claim for injunctive relief\\nunder 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983, the case would still be moot. Transfer\\nbetween facilities moots a claim for injunctive relief hinging on\\nthe location in which an individual is held. E.g., Herman v.\\nHoliday, 238 F.3d 660, 665-66 (5th Cir. 2001) (claim for\\ninjunctive relief in light of serious health risk posed by\\nenvironmental conditions was moot, and the possibility of\\ntransfer back to the original institution was too speculative to\\nprovide relief); Edwards v. Johnson, 209 F.3d 772, 776 (5th Cir.\\n2000) (claims for injunctive relief moot on transfer); Cooper v.\\nSheriff, Lubbock Cty., Tex., 929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir. 1991)\\n(per curiam) (same); Vincent v. Stevenson, 106 F.3d 397 (5th Cir.\\n\\n12a\\n\\n\\x0cB. Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Concern About a Third\\nStrike Does Not Keep This Appeal\\nAlive.\\nThe only relief that Mr. Rice sought before the\\ndistrict court was release from the Harris County Jail\\non his own recognizance for the duration of his\\ncriminal proceedings. ROA 4. This Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cjurisdiction is\\xe2\\x80\\xa6constrained to adjudicating actual,\\nongoing controversies between litigants.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Herndon v.\\nUpton, 985 F.3d 443, 446 (5th Cir. 2021). Mr. Rice can\\nno longer be granted \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe sole relief sought in h[is]\\npetition: release from confinement\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at the Harris\\nCounty Jail during the pendency of his criminal\\nproceedings. See id.\\nThus, now that Mr. Rice is no longer in Harris\\nCounty pretrial detention, there is no case or\\ncontroversy keeping this appeal alive. In his habeas\\npetition, Mr. Rice sought only his release and did not\\nseek money damages. As this Court is aware, on\\nappeal Mr. Rice sought to ensure that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstrike\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for\\npurposes of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cPLRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)\\nlodged against him by a district court would be\\nreversed. Br. at 7; see 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1915(g); Lomax v.\\nOrtiz-Marquez, 140 S. Ct. 1721, 1723 (2020)\\n(describing the PLRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthree-strikes rule\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). But that\\nconcern regarding an ancillary matter in the litigation\\ndoes not affect this appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mootness in light of Mr.\\n1997) (unpublished op.) (claims premised on inadequate medical\\ncare at a particular prison and seeking injunctive relief were\\nmooted because the plaintiff had been transferred to a different\\nprison).\\n\\n13a\\n\\n\\x0cRice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transfer to TDCJ custody, for two reasons.\\nFirst, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe PLRA does not apply to habeas petitions\\nunder 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2254.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Carson v. Johnson, 112 F.3d\\n818, 820 (5th Cir. 1997). This includes the PLRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nthree-strikes provision. Id. As a result, this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nconstrual of Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal as a habeas petition\\nmeans this case could not subsequently qualify as a\\nstrike under the PLRA. See Doc. 515735026 at 2 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe\\nconstrue Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition, at his behest, as seeking\\nhabeas relief.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nFurther, even were there a strike, its ultimate\\neffect would occur in a hypothetical subsequent\\nlawsuit in which Mr. Rice would seek to proceed in\\nforma pauperis and be barred from doing so by the\\nPLRA. The speculative possibility that Mr. Rice would\\nbe in a position to file another lawsuit, would need to\\ndo so in forma pauperis, and would be unable to do so\\nin part due to the strike in this litigation is not enough\\nto preserve this lawsuit in any event. The Fifth Circuit\\nrecently held that the possibility that an out-of-circuit\\nsentencing court might decide to modify the plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsupervised release did not create an ongoing\\ncontroversy that saved the case from mootness.\\nHerndon, 985 F.3d at 448. The same is true here,\\nwhere at most a court in subsequent litigation might\\ndecide to construe this litigation as constituting a\\nstrike. Should that occur, Mr. Rice could litigate the\\nissue in that case. See, e.g., Lomax, 140 S. Ct. at 1724\\n(petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s challenge to application of three-strikes\\nrule arguing that prior cases did not qualify as strikes,\\non a later motion to proceed in forma pauperis). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThat\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x98a favorable decision in this case might serve as a\\nuseful precedent for [the plaintiff] in a hypothetical\\nlawsuit cannot save this case from mootness.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n14a\\n\\n\\x0cHerndon, 985 F.3d at 448 (quoting United States v.\\nJuvenile Male, 564 U.S. 932, 937 (2011)).\\nHowever, the Court could, and should, both\\ndismiss the appeal as moot and dispose of this\\nancillary matter. The Court has the authority,\\nnotwithstanding this appeal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mootness, to correct the\\nerror of the district court in failing to construe the\\nlitigation as a habeas petition by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot[ing] that the\\ndistrict court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s dismissal should not count as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98strike\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nfor purposes of\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the PLRA. Muwakkil v. Robinson, 143\\nF. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 512 (4th Cir. 2005) (unpublished op.). The\\nFourth Circuit has taken this course of action, in a\\ncase in which a prisoner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appeal became moot due to\\ntransfer following the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s entry of an order\\nof dismissal\\xe2\\x80\\x94dismissing the appeal while observing\\nthat the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s error meant there should be\\nno strike. Id. While the Court has no authority to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsider [the] merits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of a moot case, it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay make\\nsuch disposition of the whole case as justice may\\nrequire.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall\\nP\\xe2\\x80\\x99ship, 513 U.S. 18, 21 (1994) (quoting Walling v.\\nJames V. Reuter, Co., Inc., 321 U.S. 671, 677 (1944)).\\nThis includes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmatters of judicial administration and\\npractice reasonably ancillary to the primary, disputedeciding function of the federal courts,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as the\\naward of costs and vacatur and remand for dismissal.\\nId. at 22. The Court retains authority \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto enter orders\\nnecessary and appropriate to the final disposition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nthe litigation, id., and the best course of action to\\nensure clarity on this matter is\\xe2\\x80\\x94as the Fourth Circuit\\ndid in Muwakkil\\xe2\\x80\\x94to note that the district court\\ndismissal is not a strike.\\nBut disposing of this ancillary matter has no effect\\non the mootness of this appeal. The underlying case or\\n15a\\n\\n\\x0ccontroversy\\xe2\\x80\\x94whether Mr. Rice should be released\\nfrom pretrial detention at the Harris County Jail\\xe2\\x80\\x94can\\nno longer be resolved in this litigation. Any\\nsubsequent concrete concern with whether this\\nlitigation qualifies as a strike must be saved for\\naccompanying subsequent concrete litigation.\\nII.\\n\\nBecause the Appeal Was Moot When\\nDecided, This Court Must Vacate its\\nOpinion as an Improvidently Issued\\nAdvisory Opinion.\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA federal court is without power to decide moot\\nquestions or to give advisory opinions which cannot\\naffect the rights of the litigants in the case before it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSt. Pierre v. United States, 319 U.S. 41, 42 (1943). This\\nprinciple is a, if not the, core limit on this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and\\nall federal courts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 authority: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe oldest and most\\nconsistent thread in the federal law of justiciability is\\nthat the federal courts will not give advisory opinions.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 96 (1968) (quoting C.\\nWright, Federal Courts 34 (1963)). See also Church of\\nScientology of Calif. v. United States, 506 U.S. 9, 12\\n(1992).\\nIf an appeal is moot, then any opinion is advisory,\\nand a court has no power to issue one. As this Court\\nhas stated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIf a claim is moot, it \\xe2\\x80\\x98presents no Article\\nIII case or controversy, and a court has no\\nconstitutional jurisdiction to resolve the issues it\\npresents.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Nat\\xe2\\x80\\x99l Rifle Ass\\xe2\\x80\\x99n of Am., Inc. v.

Vannoy,\\n981 F.3d 408, 416 (5th Cir. 2020) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMootness, of\\ncourse, is a fundamental bar to judicial review that\\n16a\\n\\n\\x0cmust be accounted for at all stages of a proceeding,\\nand applies in habeas as in any other type of\\nlitigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nMoreover, this Court must inquire into whether an\\nappeal is moot, taking into account facts that have\\ncome to the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention\\xe2\\x80\\x94and even doing so sua\\nsponte if necessary. The Court has an independent\\nduty to ensure that it has jurisdiction over each case\\nat the time it enters a decision, to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconfine[] itself to\\nits constitutionally limited role of adjudicating actual\\nand concrete disputes, the resolutions of which have\\ndirect consequences on the parties involved.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d United\\nStates v.

Because\\nMr. Rice was transferred out of pretrial detention at\\nthe Harris County Jail two months before this Court\\nentered judgment and issued its opinion, this case was\\nmoot and this Court lacked jurisdiction to take those\\nsteps. Mr. Rice respectfully requests rehearing by this\\npanel in light of the jurisdictional defect and vacatur\\nof the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and related opinion and of the\\nunderlying district court opinion.\\n\\n22a\\n\\n\\x0cIn April 2020, Mr. Rice challenged his pretrial\\ndetention, seeking immediate release due to the\\ndanger posed by his continued pretrial detention at\\nHarris County Jail in light of the COVID-19\\npandemic. He appealed an adverse decision in May\\n2020. In October 2020, Mr. Rice was sentenced; in\\nDecember 2020, he was transferred to TDCJ custody\\nto serve out that sentence. In short, by the time this\\nCourt rendered its judgment in February 2021, Mr.\\nRice was no longer at the Harris County Jail, in the\\ncustody of the Harris County Sheriff, or otherwise in\\npretrial detention. As a result, his case was already\\nmoot.\\nMr. Rice respectfully requests that, upon granting\\nrehearing, the panel vacate its original published\\nopinion for lack of jurisdiction. This is the Fifth\\nCircuit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approach to cases in which the Court\\ndiscovers, prior to issuing the mandate, that the case\\nwas moot when the panel filed its initial opinion. Mr.\\nRice also respectfully requests that this Court vacate\\nthe district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and cause the case to be\\ndismissed. In the alternative, should this Court\\ndetermine that the case is not moot, Mr. Rice\\nrespectfully requests that the Court order full briefing\\nso that he may with the advantage of counsel have the\\nopportunity to meaningfully confront the panel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nargument\\xe2\\x80\\x94which relied on cases that Mr. Rice never\\ndiscussed in his initial pro se appellate brief.\\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\\nOn April 15, 2020, Mr. Rice filed this lawsuit\\nchallenging his pretrial confinement in the Harris\\nCounty Jail and seeking \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelease . . . on his own\\nrecognizance for the pendency of his criminal\\n23a\\n\\n\\x0cproceedings.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Record on Appeal (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cROA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) 4. Mr. Rice\\nsought, as relief, either a writ of habeas corpus or an\\ninjunction ordering his immediate release. Id.\\nMr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underlying claim was that his continued\\nconfinement in pretrial detention at the Harris\\nCounty Jail violated the Fifth Amendment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Due\\nProcess Clause. Id. at 4-8. He alleged that he was at\\nincreased risk of a serious adverse outcome were he to\\ncontract COVID-19 due to his underlying health\\nconditions, including asthma and hypertension. Id. at\\n4, 6. He further alleged that his pretrial detention at\\nthe Harris County Jail \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexposed [him] to a substantial\\nrisk of serious harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 7. In support of this\\ncontention, he highlighted specific risks he faced\\nduring his detention at the Harris County Jail. Id. at\\n6-7; see also id. at 11 (Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s declaration). Finally,\\nMr. Rice alleged that his ongoing detention by Harris\\nCounty demonstrated that the Harris County Sheriff\\ndisregarded the risk that COVID-19 posed to Mr. Rice.\\nId. at 7-8.\\nOn April 28, 2020, the district court dismissed with\\nprejudice Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint, which it construed as\\na civil rights complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983\\nand not a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. Id. at\\n18, 20, 23. This appeal followed in May 2020. Id. at 24.\\nThis Court docketed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opening brief in this\\nappeal on October 1. The Sheriff of Harris County did\\nnot file a brief in response.\\nMr. Rice was thereafter sentenced to state prison\\nand transferred from Harris County Jail to TDCJ\\ncustody on December 15, 2020. Mr. Rice remains in\\nTDCJ custody at the Gist State Jail in Beaumont,\\nTexas. Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s address at the Gist State Jail is\\n24a\\n\\n\\x0clisted on this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s docket.\\nOn February 2, 2021, this Court issued a published\\nopinion in this litigation, affirming the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ndenial of relief. Doc. 00515730526 at 2. This Court\\nconstrued Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as sounding in habeas and\\nconcluded that the Court \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthus ha[d] jurisdiction over\\nthe case.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. This Court understood Mr. Rice to be, at\\nthe time the decision issued, \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca detainee in the Harris\\nCounty, Texas, jail awaiting trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. at 1.\\nARGUMENT\\nI. Rehearing Is Warranted Due to Mootness.\\nRehearing is warranted because this appeal was\\nmoot at the time of the panel\\xe2\\x80\\x99s original decision, due\\nto Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transfer to TDCJ custody. As described\\nabove, the panel appears to have believed that Mr.\\nRice remained in pretrial detention at the Harris\\nCounty Jail in February 2021. In fact, Mr. Rice had\\nalready been sentenced and transferred to TDCJ\\ncustody pursuant to that sentence, in December 2020.\\nThe appeal was therefore clearly moot at the time of\\ndecision. As a result, the appropriate course of action\\nis for this Court to vacate its prior opinion, vacate the\\ndistrict court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment, and remand the case with\\ninstructions for dismissal. United States v. Miller, 685\\nF.2d 123, 124 (5th Cir. 1982) (per curiam).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMootness . . . is a fundamental bar to judicial\\nreview that must be accounted for at all stages of a\\nproceeding, and applies in habeas as in any other type\\nof litigation.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Jackson v. Vannoy, 981 F.3d 408, 416\\n(5th Cir. 2020) (citation and internal quotation marks\\nomitted). Because it is a jurisdictional matter, this\\nCourt must consider mootness, \\xe2\\x80\\x9con its own motion, if\\n25a\\n\\n\\x0cnecessary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Mosley v. Cozby, 813 F.2d 659, 660-61 (5th\\nCir. 1987) (per curiam) (dismissing pro se appeal due\\nto lack of jurisdiction); United States v. HerediaHolguin, 823 F.3d 337, 340 (5th Cir. 2016) (mootness\\nis jurisdictional).\\nThis appeal is clearly moot. Mr. Rice is no longer a\\npretrial detainee at the Harris County Jail in the\\ncustody of the Harris County Sheriff. Instead, he is\\nincarcerated at the Gist State Jail in Beaumont,\\nTexas, in the custody of TDCJ\\xe2\\x80\\x94 and has been since\\nDecember 2020. In this litigation, Mr. Rice sought his\\nimmediate release only from the Harris County Jail in\\nlight of the danger posed by his continued detention in\\npretrial custody by the Harris County Sheriff\\nnotwithstanding the risk of contracting COVID-19.\\nROA 4. Mr. Rice is no longer detained there and, thus,\\nis no longer challenging the fact of his detention there.\\nFifth Circuit precedent is clear: once a petitioner\\nwho has sought habeas relief in the form of release\\nfrom pretrial detention has left pretrial custody, the\\nlitigation is moot. For example, in Powers v. Schwartz,\\n587 F.2d 783 (5th Cir. 1979) (per curiam), this Court\\nheld that because the petitioner was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno longer a\\npretrial detainee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d her challenge to her pretrial\\ndetention predicated on the unconstitutionality of the\\nstate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial bail scheme for certain detainees was\\nmoot. Id. at 783-84. Other Fifth Circuit opinions\\nconfirm that once pretrial detention ends, habeas\\nclaims stemming from that detention are moot.\\nFassier v. United States, 848 F.2d 1016, 1018 (5th Cir.\\n1988) (habeas request for pretrial release moot\\nfollowing conviction); Yohey v. Collins, 985 F.2d 222,\\n228-29 (5th Cir. 1993) (pretrial habeas claims mooted\\n\\n26a\\n\\n\\x0cby conviction). 1 This is the rule in other circuits as\\nwell. E.g., Jackson v. Clements, 796 F.3d 841, 843 (7th\\nCir. 2015) (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnce Mr. Jackson was convicted, the\\nclaims concerning his pre-trial confinement became\\nmoot.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); Thorne v. Warden, Brooklyn House of\\nDetention for Men, 479 F.2d 297, 299 (2d Cir. 1973)\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSince Thorne is now held as a convicted defendant\\nrather than merely on a criminal charge not yet\\nbrought to trial, the issue as to the legality of his\\ncontinued pretrial detention has been mooted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Mr.\\nRice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conviction and transfer out of pretrial detention\\nat the Harris County Jail to incarceration by TDCJ\\nmooted his case.\\nThe Fifth Circuit has likewise clearly held that\\ntransfer to another place of detention moots claims\\nthat arise based on the initial location of detention,\\nincluding those brought in habeas. Hernandez v.\\nGarrison, 916 F.2d 291 (5th Cir. 1990), for instance,\\nheld that claims brought in habeas regarding\\novercrowding, denial of medical treatment, and law\\nlibrary access at a particular federal prison became\\nmoot on transfer to a different prison. Id. at 293. This\\nlogic applies a fortiori to Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s transfer from\\nNumerous unpublished Fifth Circuit decisions likewise confirm\\nthat pretrial habeas claims, including those seeking release from\\npretrial detention, become moot following conviction. United\\nStates v. Route, 65 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 508 (5th Cir. 2003) (unpublished op.)\\n(appeal of pretrial detention order mooted by conviction); United\\nStates v. Heard, 192 F.3d 125 (unpublished op.) (same);\\nHenderson v. Criminal Dist. Ct. No. 3, 210 F.3d 366 (5th Cir.\\n2000) (unpublished op.) (habeas request for pretrial \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmediate\\nrelease\\xe2\\x80\\x9d moot following conviction); Martinez v. Atkinson, 678 F.\\nApp\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 218, 219 (5th Cir. 2017) (unpublished op.) (habeas request\\nfor pretrial release mooted by conviction); United States v.\\nFrazier, 220 F. App\\xe2\\x80\\x99x 294, 295 (5th Cir. 2007) (unpublished op.)\\n(same).\\n\\n1\\n\\n27a\\n\\n\\x0cdetention at the Harris County Jail, in the custody of\\nthe Harris County Sheriff, to incarceration at a state\\nprison, in the custody of TDCJ. Cf. Rumsfeld v.\\nPadilla, 542 U.S. 426, 434-35 (2004) (holding that the\\nimmediate custodian is the appropriate respondent in\\nhabeas litigation).\\nIn sum, because Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s pretrial detention at the\\nHarris County Jail has ended, the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jurisdiction\\nover his habeas claim\\xe2\\x80\\x94over a controversy regarding\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe restraint of which [the] petitioner complains\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nhas ended as well. Ex parte Baez, 177 U.S. 378, 390\\n(1900) (emphasis added). And once a habeas petitioner\\nis transferred to a different facility, the habeas\\npetition is likewise moot. This Court therefore lacks\\njurisdiction to consider Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim and lacked\\nsuch jurisdiction on February 2, when judgment was\\nentered. Powers, 587 F.2d at 784. Whether a medically\\nvulnerable pretrial detainee requires release in light\\nof the risk posed by COVID-19 at the Harris County\\nJail is now no more material to Mr. Rice than to the\\ngeneral public. See id. (explaining that because the\\nhabeas petitioner was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno longer a pretrial detainee,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nshe lacked \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98a personal stake in the outcome of the\\ncontroversy as to assure . . . concrete adverseness\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n(quoting Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204 (1962)). 2\\n2 This Court construed Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim as sounding in habeas.\\nWere the Court to construe it as a claim for injunctive relief\\nunder 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983, the case would still be moot. Transfer\\nbetween facilities moots a claim for injunctive relief hinging on\\nthe location in which an individual is held. E.g., Herman v.\\nHoliday, 238 F.3d 660, 665-66 (5th Cir. 2001) (claim for\\ninjunctive relief in light of serious health risk posed by\\nenvironmental conditions was moot, and the possibility of\\ntransfer back to the original institution was too speculative to\\nprovide relief); Edwards v. Johnson, 209 F.3d 772, 776 (5th Cir.\\n\\n28a\\n\\n\\x0cII.\\n\\nThe Appropriate Disposition is Vacatur of\\nthe Opinion, Vacatur of the District\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Judgment, and Dismissal of the\\nAction.\\n\\nIn these circumstances, vacatur of this Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\npublished opinion, vacatur of the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\njudgment, and dismissal of the action is the proper\\ncourse of action. First, this Court was unaware at the\\ntime that the Court entered judgment and issued its\\nopinion in February 2021 that the case had become\\nmoot. Where, as here, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[b]efore issuance of the\\nmandate . . . the parties have brought to the attention\\nof the court facts which render the case moot\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the\\nCourt has issued a published opinion, disposition is\\nstraightforward. Miller, 685 F.2d at 124. The Court\\nwill vacate the published opinion and either dismiss\\nthe appeal or remand with instructions to dismiss. Id.\\nat 124 (doing so); Shokeh v. Thompson, 375 F.3d 351,\\n351-52 (5th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (same).\\nAdditionally, because mootness is due to Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ntransfer from the Harris County Jail to TDCJ custody\\nrather than Mr. Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own subsequent actions, (1)\\nvacatur of the district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and (2) either\\ndismissal of the case or remand with instructions to\\ndismiss is appropriate under United States v.\\nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). As the Fifth\\nCircuit has explained:\\nIf a claim becomes moot after the entry\\nof a district court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s judgment and prior to\\n2000) (claims for injunctive relief moot on transfer); Cooper v.\\nSheriff, Lubbock Cty., Tex., 929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir. 1991)\\n(per curiam) (same).\\n\\n29a\\n\\n\\x0cthe completion of the appellate review,\\nwe generally vacate the judgment and\\nremand for dismissal.

JONES, Circuit Judge:\\nAppellant Rice, a detainee in the Harris County,\\nTexas, jail awaiting trial, filed what he described as a\\npetition for writ of habeas corpus seeking release from\\npretrial custody because, he contended, no conditions\\nat the jail were sufficient to protect his constitutional\\nrights in the midst of the COVID-19 crisis. Some\\nconfusion ensued when his petition and a separate\\nmemorandum in support of either \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca writ of habeas\\ncorpus or an injunction\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were mishandled in the\\nclerk\\xe2\\x80\\x99s office. Ultimately, the district court denied\\nrelief regardless whether the petition was brought\\nunder federal habeas law, 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2241, or civil\\nrights law, 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983. Rice has appealed,\\ninsisting that his petition sounds in habeas. He\\ncontends he should be released from custody because,\\n34a\\n\\n\\x0cgiven health problems including asthma and\\nhypertension, he is at a high risk for contracting the\\nvirus, yet jail conditions make it exceedingly difficult,\\nif not impossible, to practice proper hygiene and social\\ndistancing. 1\\nWe affirm the denial of relief on the following\\nbasis. We construe Rice\\xe2\\x80\\x99s petition, at his behest, as\\nseeking habeas relief, and thus have jurisdiction over\\nthe case. But we also conclude that the Great Writ\\ndoes not, in this circuit, afford release for prisoners\\nheld in state custody due to adverse conditions of\\nconfinement. Rice has not stated a claim for relief.\\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\\nIn Pierre v. United States, 525 F.2d 933, 935-36 (5th\\nCir. 1976), this court held that, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[s]imply stated,\\nhabeas is not available to review questions unrelated\\nto the cause of detention. Its sole function is to grant\\nrelief from unlawful imprisonment or custody and it\\ncannot be used properly for any other purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See\\ngenerally Preiser v.

Somehow the Motion for Preliminary\\nInjunction got filed as a separate cause and filed as a\\ncivil rights complaint pursuant 42 USC \\xc2\\xa7 1983. The\\n37a\\n\\n\\x0cMotion for Preliminary Injunction was a motion\\nrequesting immediate release from confinement due\\nto their being no conditions of confinement that did\\nnot violate my constitutional rights. The 28 USC \\xc2\\xa7\\n2241 was the only vehicle for which Petitioner sought\\nrelief (i.e. injunction relief).\\nARGUMENT\\n(1) The District Court erred in construing Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction as a civil rights\\nsuit.\\nPetitioner filed a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to\\n28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 2241 and included a motion for\\npreliminary injunction seeking his immediate release\\nfrom confinement, as there not being any condition of\\nconfinement that would not violate his due process\\nrights or prevent irreparable constitutional injury.\\nThis being because Petitioner has underlying health\\nconditions that make him extra vulnerable to loss of\\nlife or health from COVID-19. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Motion for\\nPreliminary Injunction was to be filed in conjunction\\nwith his 2241 as Petitioner sought release in the form\\nof immediate release which is only cognizable through\\nhabeas corpus and not civil rights complaint.\\nTherefore the District claims its \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrder of Dismissal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nthe civil rights action was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdismissed for failing to\\nstate a claim for which relief may be granted.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Had the\\nDistrict Court properly construed the filing as an\\napplication for writ of habeas corpus brought under\\n2241, the relief requested could have been granted, as\\nin Malam v. Adducci 2020 US District LEXIS 59407\\nwhich Petitioner sought to follow. The 2241 and\\nMotion for Preliminary Injunction were granted as\\nwell as several other interveing Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request for\\nthe same relief. Appellant admits not being well\\n\\n38a\\n\\n\\x0clettered in the law or the terms as a result used\\nPlaintiff and Petitioner interchangeably.\\n(2) The District Court erred in counting the dismissal\\nof the Motion for Preliminary Injunction as a\\nstrike.\\nPetitioner did not file a civil rights complaint\\npursuant to 42 \\xc2\\xa7 1983, but rather of writ of habeas\\ncorpus pursuant to 28 \\xc2\\xa7 2241 and motion for\\npreliminary injunction requesting relief in the form of\\nimmediate release. A strike was counted against\\nAppellant in the instant case due to the misconstruing\\nof this motion as a civil rights complaint. A strike is\\nnot normally counted against a Petitioner who\\nproceeds via 2241. In Heid v. Aderhold, 2020 U.S.\\nDist. LEXIS 144656 it was stated \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccurrently, the\\nprevailing approach in the majority of circuits to have\\naddressed the issue is not to count dismissals of\\nhabeas petitions as strikes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Jones v. Smith, 720\\nF.3d 142, 146-47 (2d Cir. 2013); Paige v. Bacarisse, 80\\nF. Appx 299, 300 (5th Cir. 2003); Andrews v. King, 398\\nF.3d 1113, 1122-23 (9th Cir. 2003); Jennings v.\\nNationa Cty.

Habeas petitions are not included under the\\nPLRA. See Kincaid v. Sparkman, 117 F.3d 949, 951\\n(6th Cir. 1997). In Kincaid, the Court held that the\\nterm \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccivilization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in \\xc2\\xa7 1915 does not include habeas\\npetitions. Therefore Appellant believes the District\\nCourt erred in counting the Dismissal as a strike\\nagainst him.\\n(3) The District Court should have allowed Appellant\\nthe opportunity to withdraw or modify the\\nmisconstrued filing.\\n\\n39a\\n\\n\\x0cThe District Court immediately ordered a\\ndismissal of Appellants suit, which was filed on April\\n15, 2020 and dismissed on April 28, 2020. The Court\\ndid not request any clarification or give Appellant an\\nopportunity to refile the suit. Appellant wrote the\\nDistrict Court and requested the District Court\\nreconsider dismissing the suit which the District\\nCourt denied.\\nCONCLUSSION\\nAppellant respectfully request that the Order of\\nDismissal and the strike imposed be reversed that the\\nAppellant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s suit be withdrawn and he be allowed to\\nrefile his 2241 at a later time.\\n9/27/20\\n/s/ Skyler Rice\\n\\n40a\\n\\n\\x0cAPPENDIX I\\nUNITED STATES\\nDISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN\\nDISTRICT OF TEXAS\\nHOUSTON DIVISION\\nSKYLER THOMAS RICE, Plaintiff, v. ED GONZALEZ,\\nSHERIFF OF HARRIS COUNTY, Defendant.\\nDocket No. 4:20-cv-01354\\n[Filed April 28, 2020]\\nORDER OF DISMISSAL\\nPlaintiff Skyler Thomas Rice filed a motion for a\\npreliminary injunction. The Court construed the\\nmotion as a civil rights complaint under 42 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7\\n1983 that seeks injunctive and equitable relief to\\nsecure his release, presumably on bond during the\\nduration of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\\nBecause he is an inmate who proceeds in forma\\npauperis, the Court is required by the Prison\\nLitigation Reform Act (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPLRA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) to scrutinize the\\ncomplaint and dismiss the case, in whole or in part, if\\nit determines that the action is frivolous, malicious,\\nfails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted,\\nor seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is\\nimmune from such relief. See 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1915A(b); 28\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1915(e)(2)(B). For the reasons below,\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request for preliminary injunctive relief is\\ndenied and the civil rights action dismissed for failing\\nto state a claim for which relief may be granted.\\n\\n41a\\n\\n\\x0cI.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nAs stated in his motion for a preliminary\\ninjunction, Plaintiff is confined at the Harris County\\nJail. See Dkt. #1 at 1. Plaintiff alleges that he remains\\nin custody pursuant to charges for possession of a\\ncontrolled substance. Id. Plaintiff alleges that he is\\nasthmatic and has hypertension. Id. Plaintiff alleges\\nthat these conditions place him at a higher risk of\\ndeath from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Id.\\nPlaintiff alleges that the common preventative\\nmeasures of social distancing and excessive hygiene\\nare exceedingly difficult if not impossible to\\naccomplish at the Harris County Jail because he\\nshares toilets, sinks, phones, and showers with other\\ninmates. Id. As stated above, Plaintiff seeks injunctive\\nrelief in the form of an order securing his immediate\\nrelease from the jail. Id. at 6.\\nII.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nTitle 42, section 1983, authorizes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuit in equity,\\nor other proper proceeding for redress\\xe2\\x80\\x9d against any\\nperson who, under color of state law, \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubjects, or\\ncauses to be subjected, any citizen of the United States\\n. . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or\\nimmunities secured by the Constitution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d See Nelson\\nv. Campbell, 541 U.S. 637, 643 (2004). However, a civil\\nrights complaint pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 1983 must yield to the\\nmore specific federal habeas statute, with its\\nattendant procedural and exhaustion requirements,\\nwhen an inmate seeks injunctive relief that challenges\\nthe fact of his conviction or the duration of his\\nsentence. Id. These claims fall within the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccore\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of\\nhabeas corpus and are thus not cognizable when\\nbrought pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 1983. Id. Constitutional claims\\nthat merely challenge the conditions of a prisoner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\n42a\\n\\n\\x0cconfinement may brought pursuant to \\xc2\\xa7 1983. Id.\\nAs stated above, Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief\\nthat secures his relief from the Harris County Jail.\\nThis claim is at the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccore\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of habeas relief, and may\\nnot be brought under a civil rights complaint. While it\\nis in the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s discretion to construe the complaint\\nas a writ of habeas corpus, such construction would be\\ninappropriate. First, Plaintiff has a pending writ of\\nhabeas corpus in Case No. 4:20-cv-1356. Second, in\\nthat writ, Plaintiff states that he filed a state\\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus that remains\\npending in the state courts. See Rice v. Ed Gonzales,\\nCase No. 4:20-cv-1356, Dkt. #1 at 5. Therefore,\\nconstruing the complaint as a writ of habeas corpus\\nwould be futile as Plaintiff has not exhausted his state\\nremedies.\\nMoreover, even if these claims could be brought in\\na civil rights complaint under \\xc2\\xa7 1983, to the extent\\nthat Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief, his civil rights\\nclaims are barred by the doctrine set out in Younger v.\\nHarris, 401 U.S. 37, 43-45 (1971). Younger held that a\\nfederal court may not interfere in an ongoing state\\ncriminal\\nproceeding\\nunless\\nextraordinary\\ncircumstances are present. See Gates v. Strain, 885\\nF.3d 874, 880 (5th Cir. 2018). Abstention is required\\nwhen \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) the federal proceeding would interfere with\\nan \\xe2\\x80\\x98ongoing state judicial proceeding\\xe2\\x80\\x99; (2) the state has\\nan important interest in regulating the subject matter\\nof the claim; and (3) the plaintiff has \\xe2\\x80\\x98an adequate\\nopportunity in the state proceedings to raise\\nconstitutional challenges.\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bice v. Louisiana Public\\nDefenders Bd., 677 F.3d 712, 716 (5th Cir. 2012)\\n(quoting Middlesex Cty. Ethics Comm. v. Garden State\\nBar Ass\\xe2\\x80\\x99n, 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982)).\\n\\n43a\\n\\n\\x0cAll three criteria are met in this case. Public\\nrecords reflect that Plaintiff is represented by counsel\\nin his Harris County criminal charges and that the\\nproceedings remain ongoing. Plaintiff also has filed a\\nstate application for a writ of habeas corpus that also\\nremains pending, which shows that he has an\\nadequate state avenue to litigate his claims. Finally,\\nPlaintiff does not show that the state does not have an\\ninterest unifying their efforts in controlling COVID19, rather than piecemeal court intervention for\\nprisoners. Moreover, Plaintiff does not otherwise\\nallege facts showing that his medical conditions make\\nhim so particularly vulnerable that extraordinary\\ncircumstances exist that warrant federal court\\nintervention in his criminal proceedings. Therefore,\\nfor the reasons stated above, Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s complaint is\\ndismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1915(e)(2)(B).\\nIII.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nPlaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s civil rights complaint under \\xc2\\xa7 1983 is\\nDISMISSED with prejudice.

The Plaintiff has underlying\\nhealth conditions that pose a significant risk of loss of\\nhealth and life due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nPetitioner is an asmatic and has hypertension, both of\\nwhich place Petitioner at a higher risk of death from\\nthe coronavirus (COVID-19). Social distancing and\\nhygiene measures are Plaintiff\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only defense against\\nCOVID-19.\\nThese\\nprotective\\nmeasures\\nare\\nexceedingly difficult, if not impossible at the Harris\\nCounty Jail where Petitioner shares toilets, sinks,\\nphones, showers, eats in communal spaces, and is in\\nclose contact with the many other detainees and\\nofficers. Social distancing of six feet would be\\nimpossible at the Harris County Jail. This concession\\nsupports the conclusion of multiple doctors and public\\nhealth experts that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe only viable public health\\nstrategy available is risk mitigation\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 The public\\nhealth recommendation is to release all people with\\nrisk factors from custody given the heigtened risk to\\ntheir health and safety.\\n\\n46a\\n\\n\\x0cARGUMENT\\nPOINT #1\\nTHE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO\\nA TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER\\nAND A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION\\nIn determining whether a party is entitled to a\\ntemporary restraining order or a preliminary\\ninjunction, courts generally consider several factors:\\nwhether the party will suffer irreparable injury, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbalance of hardships\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between the parties, the\\nlikelihood of success on the merits and the public\\ninterest. Each of these factors favors the grant of this\\nmotion.\\nA. IRREPARABLE HARM\\nPetitioner is likely to experience irreparable injury\\nabsent an injunction both in the form of loss of health\\nand life, and in the form of an invasion of his\\nconstitutional rights.\\n1. Loss of Health or Life from COVID-19\\nThe on-going COVID-19 Pandemic creates a high\\nrisk that absent an injunction by this Court,\\nPetitioner will suffer irreparable harm in the form of\\nloss of health or life as a result of contracting the\\nCOVID-19 virus.\\nOn March 23, 2020, the Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that\\ncorrectional and detention facilities \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpresent unique\\nchallenges for control of COVID-19 transmission\\namong incarcerated/detained persons, staff, and\\n47a\\n\\n\\x0cvisitors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Interim Guidance on Management of\\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Correctional\\nand Detention Facilities. Centers for Disease Control\\n(Mar. 23, 2020) https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/\\n2019-ncov/community/correction-detention/guidancecorrectional-detention.html.\\nHereinafter\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCDC\\nGuidance 3/23/2020.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Specifically, the CDC noted that\\nmany detention conditions create hightened risk of\\ndanger to detainees, these include: low capacity for\\npatient volume, insufficient quarantine space,\\ninsufficient\\non-site\\nmedical\\nstaff,\\nhighly\\ncongregational environments, inability of most\\npatients to leave the facility, and limited ability of\\nincarcerated/detained persons to exercise effective\\ndisease prevention measures (e.g., social distancing\\nand frequent hand-washing).\\nThough the CDC has recommended public health\\nguidance for detention facilities and though the Harris\\nCounty Jail had indeed implemented measures\\ndesigned to prevent spread of the disease, these\\nmeasures are inadequate to sufficiently decrease the\\nsubstantial likelihood that Petitioner will contract\\nCOVID-19. As prison officials are beginning to\\nrecognize around the country, even the most stringent\\nprecautionary measures \\xe2\\x80\\x93 short of limiting detained\\npopulation itself, \\xe2\\x80\\x93 simply cannot protect detainees\\nfrom the extremely high risk of contracting this\\nunique and deadly disease. For example, on April 1,\\n2020, the Rikers Island Jail Complex\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Chief\\nPhysician acknowledged that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfections are soaring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\ndespite the facility\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfollowing Centers for Disease\\nControl and Prevention guidelines and having moved\\nmountains to protect our patients.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Miranda Bryant,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCoronavirus spread at Rikers is a \\xe2\\x80\\x98public health\\ndisaster\\xe2\\x80\\x99, says jail\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top doctor.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The Guardian (April\\n48a\\n\\n\\x0c1,\\n2020).\\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/usnews/2020/apr/01/rikers-island-jail-cornaviruspublic-health-disaster.\\nPetitioner is 37 years of age and suffers from the\\nfollowing conditions, all most all of which place him at\\nan increased risk of dire outcome from contracting the\\nCOVID-19 virus: astma, hypertension, PTSD,\\nDepression, nicotine and opioid addiction.\\nSee Centers for Disease Control, Groups at Higher\\nRisk for Severe Illness, (Apr. 2, 2020),\\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/needextra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html (noting\\nthat \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpeople of all ages with underlying medical\\nconditions are at higher risk for severe illness,\\nparticularly if the underlying medical conditions are\\nnot well controlled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Additionally, Respondents have\\nconfined Petitioner in an environment where he\\nshares toilets, sinks, phones, and showers, eats meals\\nin communal spaces, and is in close contact with the\\nmany other detainees, officers, and visitors.\\nPetitioners involuntary interaction with purportedly\\nasymptomatic guards who rotate shifts is also a\\nsignificant factor. to exposure.\\nThese are many of the conditions that the CDC has\\nidentified as being particularly likely to increase\\nCOVID-19 transmissions in detention facilities. CDC\\nGuidance 03/23/2020. For these reasons the\\nPetitioners confinement at the Harris County Jail\\nrenders him substantially likely to contract COVID19 and his severe health conditions render him\\nsubstantially likely to suffer irreparable harm or\\ndeath as a result.\\n\\n49a\\n\\n\\x0c2. Violation of Constitutional Rights\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fifth Amendment Claim triggers a\\nfinding that the Petitioner will suffer irreparable\\nharm absent an injunction. Petitioner alleges that in\\nsubjecting him to detention conditions that amount to\\npunishment and that fail to ensure his safety and\\nhealth Respondents are subjecting him to a\\nsubstantial risk of serious harm in violation of his\\nrights under the Due Process Clause. The alleged\\nviolation of a Constitutional Right is sufficient for a\\ncourt to find irreparable harm. See Overstreet v.\\nLexington-Fayette Urban Cty, Gov., 305 F.3d 566, 578\\n(6th Cir. 2002) (citing Connection Distrib. Co. v. Reno,\\n154 F.3d 281, 288 (6th Cir. 1998). See also Rhinehart\\nv. Scott, 509 Fed. Appx. 510, 514 (6th Cir. 2018)\\n(suggesting that allegations of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccontinuing violation of\\nEigth Amendment Rights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d would trigger a finding of\\nirreparable harm). Petitioner is likely to succeed on\\nthe merits of this Fifth Amendment Claim. Mitchell v.\\nCuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 806 (2nd Cir. 1984) (when an\\nalleged deprivation of a Constitutional Right is\\ninvolved, most courts hold that no further showing of\\nirreparable injury is necessary.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\nB. LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS ON THE\\nMERITS\\nPetitioner is likely to succeed on the merits of his\\nclaim that his continued detention during the COVID19 Pandemic violates his Fifth Amendment rights.\\nThe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to\\nthe United States Constitution forbids the\\ngovernment from depriving a person of life, liberty, or\\nproperty without due process of law. US Const.\\namend. V. The protection applies to all persons within\\n50a\\n\\n\\x0cthe United States. As it pertains to Petitioner, the Due\\nProcess Clause prohibits the government from\\nimposing torture and cruel and unusual punishment\\nand confinement conditions on non-convicted\\ndetainees. See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 US 520, 535, 99 S.\\nCt. 1861, Gov. Ed. 2d 447 (1979). Under the Due\\nProcess Clause a detainee may not be punished prior\\nto an adjudication of guilt. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThis type of Fifth\\nAmendment claim is analyzed under the same rubic\\nas Eighth Amendment claims brought by prisoners.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nVillegas v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville, 709\\nF.3d 563, 565 (6th Cir. 2013). Eighth Amendment\\nclaims require a showing of deliberate indifference.\\nSee Farmer v. Brennan, 511 US 825, 835, 114 S. Ct.\\n1970, 128 L.Ed 2d 811 (1994), which has both an\\nobjective and a subjective component. Villegas v.\\nMetro. Gov\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. of Nashville, 709 F. 3d 563, 568, (6th Cir\\n2013) (citing Harrison v. Ash, 539 F. 3d 510, 518 (6th\\nCir. 2008).\\n1. Objective Component\\nThe objective component is satisfied by showing\\nthat, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabsent reasonable precautions an inmate is\\nexposed to a substantial risk of serious harm.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Richko\\nv. Wayne Cty., 819 F.3d 907, 915, (6th Cir. 2016) (citing\\nAmick v. Ohio Dep\\xe2\\x80\\x99t of Rehab. & Corr., 521 Fed. Appx.\\n354, 361 (6th Cir. 2013). A generalized risk is a\\nsubstantial risk. As the Supreme Court explained in\\nHelling v. McKinney, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe have a great difficulty\\nagreeing that prison authorities may not be\\ndeliberately indifferent to an inmate\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current health\\nproblems but may ignore a condition of confinement\\nthat is sure or very likely to cause serious illness and\\nneedless suffering the next week or month or year.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n509 US 25, 33, 11 S. Ct. 2475, 125 L.Ed. 2d 22 (1993).\\n51a\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Eighth Amendment protects against future\\nharm to inmates is not a novel proposition.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt\\nwould be odd to deny an injunction to inmates who\\nplainly proved an unsafe, life-threatening condition in\\ntheir prison on the ground that nothing yet had\\nhappened to them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id. The ever-growing number of\\nCOVID-19 outbreaks in prisons and detention\\nfacilities despite a range of precautionary measures\\ndemonstrates that the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak in\\nRespondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s facility is significant. By the time a case\\nis conformed, it will almost certainly be too late to\\nprotect Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s constitutional rights. Petitioner,\\nso long as he remains detained, is therefore exposed to\\na substantial risk of serious harm.\\n2. Subjective Component\\nThe subjective component is demonstrated by\\nshowing that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) the official being sued subjectively\\nperceived facts from which to infer a substantial risk\\nto the prisoner, (2) the official did in fact draw\\ninference, and (3) the official then disregarded that\\nrisk.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 819 F.3d at 915-16 (citing Rouster v. Cty. Of\\nSaginaw, 749 F.3d 437, 446 (6th Cir. 2014) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBecause\\ngovernment officials do not readily admit the\\nsubjective component of this test, it may be\\ndemonstrated in the usual ways, including inference\\nfrom circumstantial evidence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Richko, 819 F.3d at\\n916 (citing Dominguez v. Corr. Med. Servs., 555 F.3d\\n543, 550 (6th Cir. 2009). Additionally \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca fact-finder\\nmay conclude that a prison official knew of a\\nsubstantial risk from the very fact that the risk was\\nobvious.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842. Rightfully so: the\\nabove analysis pertaining to the risk of irreparable\\ninjury reveals that the substantial risk to Petitioner is\\nobvious. Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842.\\n52a\\n\\n\\x0cIn light of Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s underlying health\\nconditions, he is not ensured anything close to\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonable safety.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844. The only\\nreasonable response by Respondent is the release of\\nPetitioner; any other response demonstrates a\\ndisregard of the specific, severe, and life-threatening\\nrisk to Petitioner from COVID-19.\\nFor the same reasons, Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continued\\ndetention cannot \\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonably relate to any legitimate\\ngovernment purpose.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520,\\n536-39, 99 S. Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed. 2d 447 (1979) (holding\\nthat pretrial detention not reasonably related to a\\nlegitimate goverment purpose must be considered\\npunishment and therefore contrary to the Fifth\\nAmendment). Petitioner faces significant risk of death\\ndue to COVID-19. Accordingly his continued detention\\nat the Harris County Jail is both unrelated and\\ncontrary to the government purpose of carrying out his\\ncriminal proceedings. The probability of success that\\nmust be demonstrated is inversely proportional to the\\namount of irreparable injury the movants will suffer\\nabsent the stay.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Northeast Ohio Coalition for\\nHomeless and Service Employees Intern. Union, Local\\n1199, 467 F.3d at 1009 (6th Cir. 2006). Given the risk\\nand severity of irreparable harm to Petitioner and the\\nweight of public health evidence indicating release as\\nthe only reasonable option under the facts Petitioner\\nhas met his burden with respects to the merits of his\\nclaim. As explained above, Petitioner has shown a\\nlikelihood of success on the merits of his action/claim\\nthat given the extraordinary nature of the COVID-19\\npandemic, no set of possible conditions of confinement\\nwould be sufficient to protect his Fifth Amendment\\nrights. Release from custody represents the only\\nadequate remedy in this case, and it is within this\\n53a\\n\\n\\x0cCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s broad equitable power to grant it. See Swann\\nv. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Educ., 402 U.S. 1, 1516, 91 S. Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed. 2d 554(1971) (once a right\\nand a violation have been shown, the scope of a district\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equitable powers to remedy past wrongs is\\nbroad, for breadth and flexibility are inherent in\\nequitable remedies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).\\n3. Qualified Immunity\\nQualified immunity is unavailable as a defense in\\ncases seeking injunctive relief. See Pearson v.\\nCallahan, 555 U.S. 223, 242, 129 S. Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.\\n2d 565 (2009) (noting that qualified immunity defense\\nis not available in \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuits against individuals where\\ninjunctive relief is sought in addition to or instead of\\ndamages\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 806,\\n102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed. 2d 396 (1982) (describing\\nqualified immunity as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cimmunity from suits for\\ndamages\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). Because Petitioner here seeks only\\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief, qualified immunity\\ndoes not apply.\\nC. BALANCE OF EQUITIES AND PUBLIC\\nINTEREST\\nWhen the government opposes the issuance of a\\ntemporary restraining order the final two factors \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nThe Balance of Equities and The Public Interest \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\nmerge, because \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest is the\\npublic interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Pursuing America\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Greatness v.

Given the highly unusual and unique\\ncircumstances posed by the COVID-19 virus pandemic\\nand ensuing crisis, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe continued detention of aging\\nor ill detainees does not serve the public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBasank, 2020 US Dist.

Willett, Circuit Judge:\\nCaroline Ross was employed by Judson Independent School District\\nas principal of Metzger Middle School. JISD learned that Ross had violated\\nseveral district policies, and, after an investigation and hearing, the Board of\\nTrustees voted not to renew Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s term contract. Ross sued JISD, bringing\\nrace, sex, and age discrimination claims under the Texas Commission on\\nHuman Rights Act as well as retaliation and due process claims under 42\\nU.S.C. \\xc2\\xa7 1983.

Ross now appeals the grant of summary judgment for her\\nstate discrimination and federal due process claims. 1 We affirm.\\nI\\nCaroline Ross, an African American woman born in 1961, served as\\nprincipal of Metzger Middle School, part of the Judson Independent School\\nDistrict, from 2010 to 2016. Ross had a term employment contract for the\\n2015\\xe2\\x80\\x932016 school year; the contract required Ross to perform her assigned\\nduties \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith reasonable care, skill, and diligence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and to comply with all\\nJISD policies and state and federal laws. Among other things, those duties\\nincluded the proper collection, disbursement, and control of campus activity\\nfunds as well as the proper expenditure of those funds. Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract also\\nspecifically reserved JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right not to renew the contract.\\nWhen JISD conducted an annual review of Metzger\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expenditures\\nfrom the 2014\\xe2\\x80\\x932015 school year, the review raised concerns about several\\nchecks that were not countersigned by two individuals, as required by JISD\\npolicy, and several transactions that did not have all of the required\\ndocumentation. Because these transactions were part of Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s duties, JISD\\nplaced Ross on paid administrative leave while it conducted further\\ninvestigation into possible mishandling of funds at Metzger.\\nThat investigation revealed that Ross had violated JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial\\nmanagement policies and the terms of her employment contract: (1) Ross\\npermitted and authorized her secretary to sign Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name to campus\\nactivity fund checks; (2) Ross charged, or permitted faculty to charge,\\nstudents to attend pep rallies, choir concerts, theater productions, and to get\\n\\n1\\n\\nBecause Ross failed to brief her retaliation claim, she has waived any arguments\\nas to that claim. See Fed. R. App. P. 28(a)(8); United States v. Reagan, 596 F.3d 251, 254\\xe2\\x80\\x93\\n55 (5th Cir. 2010).\\n\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cCase: 20-50250\\n\\nDocument: 00515804420\\n\\nPage: 3\\n\\nDate Filed: 04/01/2021\\n\\nNo. 20-50250\\n\\ntemporary student IDs; (3) Ross charged, or permitted faculty to charge,\\nstudents to purchase composition books that had been paid for by JISD\\nfunds; (4) Ross charged faculty to wear jeans; and (5) Ross deposited the\\nproceeds from student events and faculty jeans days in a petty cash fund,\\nwhich she used to pay for non-JISD authorized expenses.\\nThe investigation also uncovered further violations of JISD policy:\\n(1) the vice principal observed a bottle of alcohol in Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s car while her car\\nwas parked on school property; (2) an assistant principal said that Ross had\\nappeared to be drunk during a school ceremony for parents and students;\\n(3) Ross had shared her passwords with her secretary and other JISD\\nemployees and had them perform her duties on JISD software; (4) Ross had\\nher secretary run personal errands for her during work hours; (5) Ross, who\\nwas a partner in a film production company, worked on a film during school\\nhours; and (6) Ross permitted and promoted a non-curricular student Bible\\nstudy group, which did not comply with the requirements of federal law or\\nJISD policy.\\nOn May 19, 2016, the JISD Board of Trustees proposed not to renew\\nRoss\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract at the end of the 2015\\xe2\\x80\\x932016 school year. JISD sent Ross a\\nNotice of Proposed Nonrenewal, which included a list of reasons for\\nnonrenewal, notified Ross of her right to request a hearing, and provided Ross\\nwith the policies that governed the hearing process and some of the evidence\\nsupporting her nonrenewal. Ross requested an open, public hearing before\\nthe Board. Before the hearing, JISD informed Ross that Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary had\\nresigned and refused to appear at the hearing.\\nOn June 17, the Board held Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nonrenewal hearing. Ross and\\nJISD called and cross-examined witnesses. Although JISD presented\\ntestimony from Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary, which was not in-person testimony, Ross\\ndid not raise a hearsay objection at the hearing. After the hearing, the Board\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCase: 20-50250\\n\\nDocument: 00515804420\\n\\nPage: 4\\n\\nDate Filed: 04/01/2021\\n\\nNo. 20-50250\\n\\nvoted not to renew Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employment contract. On June 27, Ross appealed\\nto the Texas Commissioner of Education. The Commissioner upheld the\\nBoard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision.\\nRoss then filed suit against JISD in Texas state court, alleging sex,\\nrace, and age discrimination under the Texas Commission on Human Rights\\nAct (TCHRA). Ross alleged that JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Assistant Superintendent, Elida\\nBera, who is a Hispanic woman, wanted to terminate Ross because Ross and\\nAfrican\\n\\nAmerican\\n\\nstudents\\n\\nreceived\\n\\npreferential\\n\\ntreatment\\n\\nfrom\\n\\nSuperintendent Mackey, an African American male. Ross claimed that Bera\\nplanned to replace Ross as principal with either Lisa Guerrero, a Hispanic\\nwoman, or Loretta Davidson, a Caucasian woman, but that Bera was advised\\nto proceed slowly as long as Ross had an active dispute with JISD. While\\nRoss was on paid administrative leave, JISD appointed Debbie Grady, an\\nAfrican American woman who is two years older than Ross, as the interim\\nprincipal of Metzger. After the Board decided not to renew Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract,\\nJISD appointed Tracey Valree, an African American woman who is six years\\nyounger than Ross, as principal of Metzger. Valree was principal for three\\nyears; Loretta Davidson became principal after Valree.\\nRoss amended her complaint to add two \\xc2\\xa7 1983 claims, alleging that\\nJISD retaliated against her for engaging in protected speech and deprived\\nher of protected constitutional interests without due process. JISD then\\nremoved the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment. 2 The\\n\\n2\\n\\nIn its motion for summary judgment, JISD also moved, in the alternative, for a\\nplea to the jurisdiction, solely for the TCHRA claims.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cCase: 20-50250\\n\\nDocument: 00515804420\\n\\nPage: 5\\n\\nDate Filed: 04/01/2021\\n\\nNo. 20-50250\\n\\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of JISD on all claims. 3\\nRoss timely appealed.\\nII\\nWe review summary judgment de novo. 4 Summary judgment is\\nappropriate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any\\nmaterial fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 5 We\\nview all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. 6\\nIII\\nRoss argues that the district court erred in granting summary\\njudgment in favor of JISD. We address Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s state-law discrimination\\nclaims and then her federal-law due process claim.\\nA\\nRoss brought her race, sex, and age discrimination claims against\\nJISD under the TCHRA, which prohibits employment discrimination\\nbased on \\xe2\\x80\\x9crace, color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 7 The\\nSupreme Court of Texas has instructed Texas courts to consult judicial\\ninterpretations of Title VII and follow the approach of the United States\\nSupreme Court in interpreting Title VII when reviewing TCHRA claims.8\\nThat means a plaintiff can prove discriminatory intent with direct evidence\\n\\n3\\n\\nThe district court did not address JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alternative motion for a plea to the\\njurisdiction for the TCHRA claims.\\n4\\n\\nMoss v.

Only the fourth element of her prima facie claim is disputed, so\\nRoss must show either that she was replaced by someone outside her\\nprotected class or treated less favorably than similarly situated individuals\\nwho were outside her protected class. Ross fails to show either.\\nFirst, Ross claims that she has shown that she was replaced by Loretta\\nDavidson, who is Caucasian and thus outside Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s racial protected class.\\nBut the undisputed facts refute this argument. Debbie Grady, the interim\\nreplacement while Ross was on paid administrative leave, is African\\nAmerican. And Tracy Valree, who became the principal after the Board\\nvoted not to renew Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s employment contract, is also African American.\\nRoss contends that we should not consider Grady or Valree because they\\nwere temporary replacements; instead, she says that we should consider only\\nher permanent replacement, Loretta Davidson, who is Caucasian. 15 Ross\\nprovides no evidence that Valree was deemed a temporary replacement by\\nJISD, that JISD told Valree she was a temporary replacement, or that any\\nfaculty at Metzger viewed Valree as a temporary replacement. Moreover,\\nValree served as principal for three years before Davidson became principal.\\nBecause all the evidence indicates that Valree was Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permanent\\nreplacement, the undisputed facts establish that Ross was not replaced by\\nsomeone outside her protected racial class.\\nSecond, Ross argues that she has shown that she was treated less\\nfavorably than similarly situated individuals who are outside of her protected\\n\\nwaived and cannot be considered or raised on appeal.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (quoting Keenan v. Tejeda, 290 F.3d\\n252, 262 (5th Cir. 2002))).\\n15\\n\\nSee Herbert v. City of Forest Hill, 189 S.W.3d 369, 376 (Tex.

To succeed on this argument, Ross must proffer a comparator\\xe2\\x80\\x94a\\nJISD employee whose contract was renewed \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunder nearly identical\\ncircumstances.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 16 To satisfy this requirement, Ross must show that the\\nproffered comparator and she: (1) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheld the same job or responsibilities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\n(2) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshared the same supervisor or had their employment status determined\\nby the same person\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; (3) \\xe2\\x80\\x9chave essentially comparable violation histories\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;\\nand (4) have engaged in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnearly identical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d conduct to the conduct that\\nresulted in Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nonrenewal. 17 Ross proffered eleven individuals as\\ncomparators. Because five of those individuals had substantially different job\\nresponsibilities, they do not qualify as comparators. 18 Of the remaining six,\\nwho were either principals or vice principals at JISD schools, their conduct\\nincluded covering up a teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inappropriate contact with a student,\\nrequiring teachers to change students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 grades, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfail[ing] in leadership,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and\\nviolating unspecified JISD policies and practices. Their conduct was not\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cnearly identical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nconduct,\\n\\nwhich involved\\n\\nfinancial\\n\\nmismanagement, inappropriate fundraising, inappropriate alcohol use, and\\nmisuse of funds and work time. Thus, Ross has failed to provide an adequate\\ncomparator. The undisputed facts show that Ross was not treated differently\\nthan similarly situated individuals outside her protected racial class.\\n2\\nWe next address Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sex discrimination claim. Because Ross was\\nreplaced by three women (Grady, Valree, and Davidson), the undisputed\\nfacts establish that Ross was not replaced by someone outside her protected\\n\\n16\\n\\nLee v. Kan. City S.

And Ross fails to raise a dispute of fact to show that she was treated less\\nfavorably than other similarly situated individuals because none of the four\\nmen whom Ross proffers qualifies as a comparator for the same reasons as\\nabove.\\n3\\nFinally, we address Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age discrimination claim. When the Board\\ndecided not to renew Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract, Ross was fifty-five and thus protected\\nunder the TCHRA, which applies to employees who are forty or older. 19 To\\nestablish the last, and only disputed, element of her prima facie case for age\\ndiscrimination, Ross must show either that she was \\xe2\\x80\\x9creplaced by someone\\nsignificantly younger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctreated less favorably than others who were\\nsimilarly situated but outside the protected class.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 20 Ross has not shown that\\nshe was treated less favorably because she has failed to proffer any\\ncomparators for this claim. The eleven individuals whom she proposes as\\ncomparators were for her race and gender discrimination claims, not her age\\ndiscrimination claim. And Ross does not provide any information about these\\nindividuals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ages.\\nWhether Ross has shown that she was replaced by someone\\nsignificantly younger is a closer call. Grady, Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interim replacement, and\\nValree, Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s permanent replacement, were also over forty and thus\\nmembers of the protected class: Grady was fifty-seven (two years older than\\nRoss), and Valree was forty-nine (six years younger than Ross). Even though\\nGrady and Ross were within the protected age class, Ross can still establish\\nher prima facie case if Valree is \\xe2\\x80\\x9csignificantly younger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than her. 21 While\\n\\n19\\n\\nSee Tex.

Assuming that Ross did establish a prima facie case of age\\ndiscrimination, the burden shifted to JISD to rebut the presumption of\\ndiscrimination by providing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9clegitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for its\\nnonrenewal of Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contract. 24 JISD did that when it detailed Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnumerous policy violations and performance issues in its Notice of Proposed\\nNonrenewal. Ross argues that JISD provided a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnonspecific laundry [list]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nof allegations, which should not be sufficient to rebut the presumption of\\ndiscrimination. But JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s list is very specific, including, among other\\nreasons, Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cengag[ing] in impermissible fund raising activities by\\ncharging students for composition books paid for by the district and for\\nattending events such as pep rallies and performances,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwork[ing]\\non an outside film project during her work hours and [] not [being] truthful\\n\\n22\\n\\nSee Grosjean v.

Ross\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brief focuses exclusively on whether\\nthe reasons provided JISD were a pretext for racial discrimination. But she\\ndoes not provide a single piece of evidence to indicate that JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasons\\nwere a pretext for age discrimination. Thus, Ross fails to raise a dispute of\\nmaterial fact to show that JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasons for not renewing her contract were\\na pretext for age discrimination. 27\\nB\\nRoss argues that the district court erred in granting summary\\njudgment on her due process claim because JISD terminated her without a\\n\\n25\\n\\nRoss also tries to relitigate JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reasons for not renewing her term contract\\nbecause she did not have a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of whether she was\\nfired for being a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack, older woman.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The record refutes this argument: Ross had an\\nopportunity at her hearing to present evidence.

To prevail on her claim,\\nRoss must show: \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(1) that she was discharged; (2) that stigmatizing charges\\nwere made against her in connection with the discharge; (3) that the charges\\nwere false; (4) that she was not provided notice or an opportunity to be heard\\nprior to her discharge; (5) that the charges were made public; (6) that she\\n\\n28\\n\\nGentilello v.

For\\nexample, the undisputed evidence shows that Ross was provided notice and\\nan opportunity to be heard prior to her discharge. The Board sent Ross a\\nNotice of Proposed Nonrenewal before it voted not to renew her contract,\\nand that notice provided Ross with a summary of the charges against her and\\nher right to request a hearing prior to being discharged. And Ross points to\\nno evidence in the record to contradict that JISD provided sufficient notice.\\nShe has therefore failed to establish that she has a protected liberty interest.\\nIV\\nRoss failed to establish a prima facie case for race and sex\\ndiscrimination. She also failed to generate a dispute of material fact to show\\nthat JISD\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legitimate reasons for not renewing her contract were a pretext\\nfor age discrimination. And the undisputed evidence demonstrates that Ross\\ndoes not have a protected property interest and that JISD did not deprive\\nher of a protected liberty interest.

Cook, 204 W. Va. 591, 515 S.E.2d\\n127 (1999) to remain on the jury when an alternate juror was available and had never\\nbeen excused from the jury at the time of the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objection?\\nIn the instance of a_biased juror, that juror \"can be dismissed and\\nreplaced with an alternate juror.\" United States v. Thompson, 744\\nF.2d 1065. 1068 (4th Cir. 1984); Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c). Here, the\\njudge did just that--he removed the juror and replaced him with an\\nalternate juror, a measure which eliminated the prejudice of the juror\\nknowing a witness, but did not necessitate the expense and delay of a\\nmistrial.\\nThe court failed by not removing the juror, Victor Owens from the jury and\\nreplacing with the alternate juror. The juror, Victor Owens engaged in a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheated\\ndiscussion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with one of the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witnesses, Frank Brent, while working together in\\n2011 concerning the Petitioner, Brenda Cook. The juror called the Petitioner a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmurderer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Once the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney was made aware of the incident, he requested\\nthe court to remove the juror, Victor Owens from the jury and be replaced with the\\nalternate juror. The alternate juror had not been excused from the jury at the time of this\\nrequest by the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney.\\nThe Court misrepresented the facts when it stated the alternate juror was seen\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cencouraging the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Prosecuting Attorney commented after the alternate\\njuror was released from the jury she went and sit down on the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side and was\\n\\nPage| 1\\n\\n\\x0cseen talking to the friends of the Defendant and he described the alternate juror as being\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctainted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for being the reason she was not used to replace the biased juror. The alternate\\njuror, Leslie Clark, was picked out of a selection of two people left to choose from\\nduring jury selection. The other person, Jacquelyn Kessel, stated she had worked with\\nthe Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father-in-law and wasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t sure she could be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfair and impartial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. So the\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney chose Leslie Clark as the alternate (See Appendix E). At the time\\nof the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request to remove the biased juror from the jury the alternate was still\\nseated with the jury. The Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s remark that the alternate juror was tainted was false\\ninformation since the process was she was released from the jury first and then came\\nback into the courtroom and sit down at the first available seat, which happened to be on\\nthe Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side of the room. The alternate juror and the Defendant did not know\\neach other and did not speak to each other.\\nIf the Court felt the alternate juror was tainted the trial could have proceeded\\nusing a jury of eleven according to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure - Jury or\\nNon-Jury Trial Rule 23. The court again misrepresented the facts. The court denied the\\nrequest to use the alternate juror.\\nThe Court stated the Defendant could have recalled the witness, Frank Brent to\\nthe stand to confirm the altercation between him and the juror, Victor Owens. The\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney had filed a Motion in Limine before the trial began to eliminate\\nanyone discussing the murder trial in 1997. There were family members and friends of\\nthe jury in the courtroom and the jury was at no time sequestered during the trial.\\nThe Court approved the submission of Frank Brent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s notarized affidavit as part of\\nthe Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brief. The affidavit confirmed the juror had called the Defendant a\\n\\nPage|2\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmurderer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in 2011 when they were working together (See Appendix H). The court erred\\nby denying the appeal and the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to an impartial jury.\\n\\nII.\\n\\nHas the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment right to an impartial jury\\nbeen violated when the court erred in allowing the juror, Victor Owens, to omit in voir\\ndire questioning that he had prejudicial knowledge of the Petitioner, Brenda Cook and the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witness Frank Brent?\\nThe court erred in allowing the juror Victor Owens to remain on the jury when he\\nlied by omission during the voir dire questioning. During the voir dire questioning, the\\njuror Victor Owens only admitted to knowing the Prosecuting Attorney; however, he\\nfailed to admit he knew the Petitioner Brenda Cook or his former co-worker Frank Brent\\nwho was one of the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witnesses. Juror Victor Owens and Frank Brent had\\nworked together for several years and a heated discussion occurred when the name\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBrenda Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d came up at work and Mr. Owens called Ms. Cook a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmurderer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nIn Conaway v. Polk, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 87702\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe text of the Sixth Amendment mandates that in all criminal\\nprosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a trial by an impartial\\njury. U.S. Const, amend. VI. And the U.S. Supreme Court has long\\nrecognized that the Sixth Amendment prohibits biased jurors from serving\\non criminal juries. The Sixth Amendment\\'s text prohibits partial jurors,\\nwhether bias is actual or implied. A juror\\'s bias may be established by\\nshowing (1) that the juror failed to answer honestly a material question on\\nvoir dire; and (2) that a correct response to that question would have\\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause. Additionally, a litigant\\nmust show that the fairness of his trial was affected either by the juror\\'s\\nmotives for concealing the information or the reasons that affect the juror\\'s\\nimpartiality.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe juror, Victor Owens \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfailed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nwhen asked if any of the jurors knew the Defendant, Brenda Cook and the witness,\\nPage|3\\n\\n\\x0cFrank Brent (See Appendix D). A \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorrect response to that question would have\\nprovided a valid basis for a challenge for cause\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.\\nMcDonough Power Equipment v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 states:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe failure of a juror to folly and truthfully answer questions\\npropounded to the panel is deemed reversible error upon a showing of\\nprobable bias of the juror with consequential prejudice to the unsuccessful\\nlitigant. The withholding of insignificant or trifling information indicative\\nof only a remote or speculative influence on the juror is not deemed\\nprejudicial. A new trial is required, however, if the suppressed information\\nis of sufficient cogency and significance to cause us to believe that counsel\\nwas entitled to know of it when he came to exercise his right of\\nperemptory challenge\\nThe Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the\\njuror\\'s failure to respond affirmatively to the question on voir dire had\\nprejudiced respondents\\' right of peremptory challenge.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIII. Has the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment right to an impartial jury\\nbeen violated when the court denied the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request the biased juror,\\nVictor Owens, approach the bench for questioning?\\nThe court erred in not granting the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s request of having the\\njuror, Victor Owens, approach the bench for further questioning (See Appendix A Page 3).\\nThe United States Court of Appeals For The Fourth District case Porter v. Zook,\\nF.3d 408. 2018 U.S. decided the following:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cOVERVIEW: HOLDINGS: [1 ]-In dismissing the actual juror bias\\nclaim of the 28 U.S.C.S. 2254 petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x94who was convicted in\\nVirginia state court of capital murder and was sentenced to death\\xe2\\x80\\x94the\\ndistrict court failed to recognize the applicability of U.S. Supreme\\nCourt precedent requiring a hearing in the circumstances, erected\\ninappropriate legal barriers and faulted petitioner for not overcoming\\nthem, and ignored judicially-recognized factors in determining\\nwhether a hearing was necessary;.... \\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nPage 14\\n\\n\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe Sixth Amendment, made applicable to the states through the\\nFourteenth Amendment, requires that a state provide an impartial jury\\nin all criminal prosecutions. If even one partial juror is empaneled and\\nthe death sentence is imposed, the State is disentitled to execute the\\nsentence. The remedy for allegations of juror partiality is a hearing in\\nwhich the Defendant has the opportunity to prove actual bias. And\\npreservation of the opportunity to prove actual bias is a guarantee of a\\nDefendant\\'s right to an impartial jury.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nIV.\\n\\nHas the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fourteenth (XIV) Amendment right to due process been\\nviolated when the court erred by allowing the State to introduce\\n404(b) evidence but disallowed the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 404(b) rebuttal evidence?\\nThe court erred in allowing the State to use the checks from 2006 - 2011 as\\n404(b) evidence \\xe2\\x80\\x9cas proof of intent, motive, common scheme, plan, or absence of\\nmistake\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and not allowing her to use her 404(b) rebuttal evidence in the form of a threering binder. The rebuttal evidence was a spreadsheet started by the Defendant in 2006 on\\na flash drive at her place of employment. The court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s statement that the Defendant was\\nindicted the first time on $116,628 was false. The Defendant was never indicted on this\\namount nor the applicants for the years of 2006-2011. She was originally indicted on\\n$22,400 for the months of July and August 2012 applicants only.\\nThe 404(b) hearing was held on January 4, 2019 (See Appendix I). There was no\\ndeadline date ordered for submission of rebuttal evidence at this hearing. The order\\nstates on Page 2 the following:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cTherefore, the State advised the Court that the hearing on December 17th, 2018,\\ninvolved many issues; that the State had taken notes in anticipation of doing the order;\\nthat the State had drafted a proposed order; that the order was forwarded to Defense\\nCounsel for edification; that the differences between what the State believed was the\\nCourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling and what the Defense believed the Court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling was, were significant and\\nPage|5\\n\\n\\x0cboth the State and Defense Counsel requested that the Court direct its clerk to review the\\nrulings of the Court on that day, and prepare an appropriate order with regard to the\\nMotion in Limine and any other rulings made by the Court that day.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nAn \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAmended Order Regarding Pre-Trial Hearing Motions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was completed by\\nthe State and the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney received the order ten days prior to the trial. It\\nwas filed by the Circuit Court Clerk on March 26, 2019 (beginning day of trial). Due to\\nthe late completion and mailing of the Amended Order by the State, the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nattorney had only a few days to decipher what discovery material could be used in the\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s defense. The court erred by not allowing the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s three-ring binder\\ncontaining receipts and a spreadsheet accounting for the money reimbursed to the\\npetitioner during the years of 2006-2011 to be admitted as evidence. The Petitioner\\nbelieved her first attorney had submitted this material to the court as part of the discovery\\nmaterial in June 2017. This case was dismissed in August 2017 due to the way the Grand\\nJury Indictment was written; however once the Petitioner was indicted a second time by\\nthe second prosecuting attorney the court agreed neither party had to resubmit the\\npaperwork. One week prior to the trial in March 2019, the Prosecuting Attorney told the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney he had not received the 404(b) evidence. The Petitioner handdelivered a copy of the 404(b) evidence to both the Prosecuting Attorney and the court.\\nBoth the Prosecuting Attorney and the Judge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary signed a statement on March 18,\\n2019 they had received the 404(b) rebuttal evidence (See Appendix J and Appendix K).\\nDuring the trial, the court denied the 404(b) material in a 3-ring binder, as evidence\\nbecause the Prosecuting Attorney stated it had not been submitted in a timely manner;\\nhowever, he accepted and signed for the 3-ring binder. The court erred in denying the\\npetitioner the right to due process.\\nPage|6\\n\\n\\x0cV.\\n\\nHas the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fourteenth (XIV) Amendment right to due process of the law been\\nviolated when the court erred in not allowing the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Expert Witness, Craig\\nCorkrean, to testify at the trial even though the Circuit Court agreed at the Discovery\\nHearing four months prior to the trial that the Expert Witness would be allowed to\\ntestify?\\nFederal Rules of Evidence Rule 702: Testimony by Expert Witnesses states as\\nfollows:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,\\nor education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:\\n(a) the experts scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the\\ntrier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;\\n(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;\\n(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and\\n(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the\\ncase.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s right to due process of law was violated when the court erred in not\\nallowing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpert witness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, Craig Corkrean, to testify at the Circuit Court trial. The\\ncourt erred when they stated, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe [c]ourt finds that the testimony of [Mr. Corkrean] is\\nunnecessary and irrelevant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Mr. Corkrean is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cQualified Digital Extraction and\\nAnalysis Expert by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. He also holds the\\nfollowing degrees and licenses:\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Owner of Digital Forensics Investigations, LLC\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Graduate of FBI National Academy\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Graduate of WV State Police Academy\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Masters of Science Degree in Digital Forensics\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Masters of Science Degree in Criminal Justice\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 FBI and West Virginia Certified Instructor in Crime Scene Processing\\n\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Chief of Police in Glenville, WV\\nPage|7\\n\\n\\x0cThe expert witness would have used his specialized knowledge in explaining his\\nfindings of a specific document named \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFamily Support Award Letter\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFamily\\nSupport Contract\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on the computer, which had been accessed on four different occasions\\nbefore the Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office was notified to do an investigation and multiple\\ntimes throughout the years after the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination. The Family Support\\nContract accounted for eight (8) of the twenty-two (22) guilty verdicts against the\\nDefendant. Had Mr. Corkrean been allowed to testify it would have helped \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe trier of\\nfact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The documents presented\\nby the prosecutor as evidence showed various times they had been altered.\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney requested multiple times the \\xe2\\x80\\x9coriginal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d documents be\\nsubmitted to the Petitioner before the trial but only received the altered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccopied\\xe2\\x80\\x9d version.\\nThe Prosecutor stated it was impossible for the computer to print two different\\ncolored inks and proves he had limited knowledge of computer technology. The act of\\ncutting and pasting documents was clearly done on the documents they submitted as\\nevidence. The correct way of completing a Family Support Contract page meant the top\\nportion of the Family Support Contract was completed on the computer with the name of\\nthe recipient and the name of the vendor. This document was accessed and modified\\nafter the Defendant was terminated. The Defendant relied on the testimony of Mr.\\nCorkrean to demonstrate this process. Eight (8) of the twenty-two (22) felonies was\\nattributed to this document. By not allowing the expert witness to testify and the court\\ncommitting this error, it denied the Defendant a fair trial and due process.\\n\\nPage|8\\n\\n\\x0cThe Circuit Court judge agreed after six (6) years of requesting by the\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney that the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer at work be analyzed. The court stated\\nthe State of West Virginia would not pay for the forensic analysis. The Petitioner agreed\\nto pay the cost of $11,000. The Petitioner believed she was being retaliated against for\\nreporting Medicaid Fraud, being committed by certain employees, to her supervisor, the\\nDirector of Potomac Highlands Guild, Inc. The Guild employee, Brandon Judy testified\\nhe found no Medicaid fraud reports on the computer. Even though Brandon Judy was\\none of the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s witnesses he lied on the witness stand and Mr. Corkrean could\\nhave proven it. These reports were found by Craig Corkrean on the computer; however,\\nhe was not allowed to testify to their validity. The court misunderstood the facts. The\\nMedicaid fraud reports were in relation to The Potomac Highlands Guild overbilling. In\\nadditional to the overbilling PHG used the targeted funds intended for the Family Support\\nProgram for the agency\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operational expenses which was illegal without prior approval\\nfrom the State. This caused a delay in the applicants getting their funds, which led the\\nDefendant to use her personal funds to help the applicants. The Defendant had the\\nExecutive Director\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval. Unfortunately, the Executive Director got Alzheimer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nand was unable to testify at court.\\nDuring the Discovery Hearing in December 2018, it was agreed by the court to\\nallow the expert witness, Craig Corkrean, to testify at the trial (See Appendix F);\\nhowever, on the day he was to testify the court stated he would not be allowed (See\\nAppendix G). Mr. Corkrean would have also testified to the fact the computer was kept\\nin operation by Potomac Highlands Guild for six and one-half (6 Vi) years and the\\ndocuments to prove the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innocence had been accessed and/or altered four\\nPage | 9\\n\\n\\x0ctimes within four months (not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone month\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as believed and stated by the court) of the\\nPetitioner being suspended in December 2012 until the time The Potomac Highlands\\nGuild contacted the Medicaid Fraud Unit in March 2013 for an investigation. The\\ncomputer log-in during these times were logged in under the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s name and\\npassword and was continuously used for several years after her suspension. Mr.\\nCorkrean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Digital Forensic Investigations Report states (See Appendix L - Page 25):\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cthere was over 100,000 files on the Dell\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard drive with a\\nmodified date after Brenda Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s termination date in December\\nof 2012, it appears the computer continued to be used by other\\nunknown individuals, who accessed Brenda Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s user profile as\\nrecently as March of 2018 and even opened and modified files.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nMr. Corkrean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony would have proved relevancy and most definitely shown it was\\nnecessary in proving the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innocence by proving the computer was tampered\\nwith and documents modified after the Defendant was terminated. This violated the\\nDefendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s due process to a fair trial.\\n\\nPage|10\\n\\n\\x0cREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION\\n\\n1)\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitutional Right (Amendment V, Amendment VI, and Amendment\\nXIV) to an impartial jury was violated based on the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to keep a biased\\njuror on the jury. The Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s second-degree murder conviction in August 1997 was\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cvacated and remanded\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia in the Spring\\nof 1999. The Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial in 2019 had no relationship to the one held in 1997;\\nhowever, a juror who showed bias toward the petitioner in 2011 when he called her a\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cmurderer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, was permitted to stay on the jury by the court.\\n\\n2)\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitutional Right (Amendment VI) to an impartial jury was violated\\nbased on the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s decision to keep a juror on the jury when in voir dire questioning he\\nomitted the fact that he knew the Defendant, Brenda Cook and a witness, Frank Brent. It\\nwas clear the juror was biased toward the Defendant in 2011, which was fourteen (14)\\nyears after the murder trial in 1997 when he called the Defendant a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmurderer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. If he did\\nnot forget about the incident after that amount of time, he would have still remembered it\\nin 2019, which was only eight (8) years after his \\xe2\\x80\\x9cheated discussion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with the witness,\\nFrank Brent and his remarks about the Defendant.\\n\\n3)\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitutional Right (Amendment V, Amendment VI, and Amendment\\nXIV) to an impartial jury was violated when the Court denied the Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Attorney\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nrequest the biased juror approach the bench for questioning.\\n\\n4)\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitutional Right (Amendment XIV) to due process was violated\\nwhen she was not allowed to present her 404(b) rebuttal evidence in the form of a 3-ring\\nbinder, at trial when a copy had been given to the first prosecuting attorney in June 2017.\\nPage|11\\n\\n\\x0cThe first indictment was dismissed by the court in August 2017. The new prosecuting\\nattorney in November 2017, with the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval, agreed the paperwork did not need\\nto be recopied for either party. One week prior to the trial the prosecuting attorney stated\\nhe did not have the 404(b) rebuttal evidence. The State typed up the 404(b) Order for\\nJanuary 4,2019 and provided wrong information. The order was amended; however, it\\nwas not provided to the Defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attorney until ten (10) days prior to the trial. The\\nDefendant then hand-delivered a copy of the 404(b) rebuttal evidence from the 3-ring\\nbinder to both the prosecuting attorney and the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary. At trial, the\\nprosecuting attorney objected to the submission of the 404(b) rebuttal evidence and the\\ncourt agreed because it was given to them one week prior to the trial. Both the\\nProsecuting Attorney and the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secretary signed to accept the 3-ring binder and it\\nshould have been allowed in the trial as 404(b) rebuttal evidence. The court erred in not\\nallowing the 404(b) rebuttal evidence into trial.\\n5)\\n\\nThe Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Constitutional Right (Amendment XIV) was violated when her \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexpert\\nwitness\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was not allowed to testify at the trial when he had already been approved by the\\ncourt at the discovery hearing four months prior to the trial. The expert witness\\ncompleted a 25-page report and was prepared to explain it to the jury. This trial was\\nbased on paper documents that originated from the computer.

Sherman, Jr., appeals the June 11, 2019,\\norder of the Circuit Court of Grant County that sentenced her on fourteen counts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cobtaining\\nmoney by false pretenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, and eight counts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuttering.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Respondent State of West Virginia, by\\ncounsel Benjamin F. Yancey, III, filed a response in support of the circuit court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order. Petitioner\\nfiled a reply.\\n\\n/\\'\\n* \\xe2\\x96\\xa0\\n\\nThe Court has considered the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 briefs and the record on appeal. The facts and legal\\narguments are adequately presented, and the decisional process would not be significantly aided\\nby oral argument. Upon consideration of the standard of review, the briefs, and the record\\npresented, the Court finds no substantial question of law and no prejudicial error. For these reasons,\\na memorandum decision affirming the circuit court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order is appropriate under Rule 21 of the\\nRules of Appellate Procedure.\\nFollowing an investigation by the West Virginia Department of Health and Human\\nServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, petitioner Brenda Cook was originally indicted for crimes\\nrelated to at least 148 checks totaling $116,628.89 that were allegedly written between 2006 and\\n2011. These charges arose from petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work as the Family Support Coordinator for the\\nPotomac Highland Guild, Inc. (the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGuild\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). In that role, petitioner assisted those in need of\\nfunding for assistive devices from the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources\\n(\\xe2\\x80\\x9cDHHR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). However, the circuit court dismissed the indictment without prejudice in 2015.\\nIn November of 2017, petitioner was indicted on fifteen counts of forgery in violation of\\nWest Virginia Code \\xc2\\xa7 61-4-5, fifteen counts of uttering in violation of West Virginia Code \\xc2\\xa7 614-5, fifteen counts of taking the identity of another person in violation of West Virginia Code \\xc2\\xa7\\n61-3-54, and fourteen counts of obtaining money under false pretenses in violation of West\\nVirginia Code \\xc2\\xa7 61-3-24(a). These charges also arose from petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s work for the Guild. The\\ncharges focused on twenty-four checks dated October 5, 2012, from fifteen client accounts that\\ntotaled $22,600. The State claimed petitioner diverted that amount for her own use by depositing\\nthe money into her credit card accounts and using it to pay her bills.\\n1\\n\\nAppend.* A\\n\\n\\x0cPetitioner rejected an offer to plead guilty to five felonies, pay restitution, and serve one to\\nten years in prison.\\nPrior to petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial, the State moved pursuant to Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia\\nRules of Evidence to admit into evidence the 148 checks on 96 client accounts totaling\\n$116,628.89, that were the subject of petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first/dismissed indictment. At the hearing on the\\nmotion, the State called Gwen Grove, an investigator from the Department of Health and Human\\nServices\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, who was assigned to petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case. Ms. Grove testified\\nas follows:\\nThe State: Now, [petitioner, in her second indictment] is charged with multiple\\noffenses dealing with applications and [twenty-four] checks that were from October\\n2012; is that correct?\\nMs. Grove: Yes.\\nThe State: Now, ... did it become apparent that she was representing that she was\\neither being framed or set up as a result of being a whistleblower [alleging the Guild\\ncommitted Medicaid fraud]?\\nMs. Grove: Yes.\\nThe State: ... I want the [c]ourt to correct... the 404(b) motion[.] On the fourth\\nline, it says there are 93 additional contracts. Miss Grove did you miscount, and are\\nthere 96?\\nMs. Grove: I did. I recounted yesterday, and there are 96.\\nThe State: All right. How many additional checks did your investigation team\\ndetermine - not counting the ones in 2012 [for which petitioner was indicted] were directed into Ms. Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal credit card accounts, [that paid] her bills?\\nMs. Grove-. An additional 148 checks.\\nThe State: And of those 148 checks, how much additional money, in addition to the\\n15 charged in the current indictment, was your investigatory team able to trace into\\nher accounts.\\nMs. Grove: $116,628.89\\nOver petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objection, the circuit court granted the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion and allowed the\\nevidence to be introduced as proof of petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intent, motive, common scheme, plan, or absence\\nof mistake.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s four-day trial took place in March of 2019. During voir dire, the court asked\\nthe venire whether any of them (1) knew petitioner socially or through business; (2) had a state of\\n2\\n\\n\\x0cmind or belief that would prevent them from being impartial; (3) could disregard anything they\\nmight have heard about the case and render an impartial verdict; (4) knew any of the witnesses,\\nincluding defense witness Frank Brent; and (5) were conscious of a bias for or against petitioner\\nthat would interfere with their ability to be impartial. Venire member Victor Owens, who\\nultimately sat on the jury, did not respond to any of these questions.\\nAt trial, the State presented evidence that petitioner used her position at the Guild to\\nunlawfully transfer twenty-four checks, on October 5, 2012, totaling $22,600 to her credit card\\naccounts. The checks were connected to fifteen Guild accounts for which petitioner was\\nresponsible. The State also presented the Rule 404(b) evidence that petitioner transferred an\\nadditional 148 checks, totaling $116,628.89, from Guild accounts for which petitioner was\\nresponsible. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel moved to introduce rebuttal evidence, a three-ring binder\\ncontaining petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit card statement, receipts, and other documents. However, the court\\nruled that the contents of the binder were inadmissible because they were not provided to the State\\nuntil a week before trial, and past the discovery deadline.\\nFollowing the close of all evidence and a lunch break on the third day of trial, March 28,\\n2019, petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel reported he had just learned from petitioner that she received a phone\\ncall from defense witness Frank Brent on the evening of March 27, 2019.1 Mr. Brent testified\\nearlier on March 27th at petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel told the court that Mr. Brent said he\\nrecognized juror Victor Owens as a former coworker and that, when the two worked together, they\\nargued almost to the point of blows regarding whether petitioner had committed a murder in the\\n1990s.2 Mr. Brent stated that Juror Owens believed petitioner committed the murder, while he\\nbelieved petitioner was innocent. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel then called Mr. Brent on the phone.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel said that Mr. Brent verified what he said to petitioner the night before. Mr.\\nBrent also told petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel that he believed his encounter with Mr. Owens occurred in\\n2011. Following the lunch break on March 28, 2019, petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel asked to voir dire Juror\\nOwens in the courtroom based on Mr. Brent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims. The court responded as follows:\\nCircuit Court: Why would we voir dire him now?\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Counsel. I mean, if it was over my client and whether or not she was a\\nmurderer or it was a justified homicide or whatever, it maybe - I think it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a real\\nissue.\\n\\n1 Later, petitioner said that Witness Brent both spoke to her during a break at trial on March\\n27, 2019, regarding juror Victor Owens and called her again that evening to discuss Juror Victor\\nOwens.\\n2 Petitioner was convicted of second-degree murder in 1997. However, on appeal, this\\nCourt vacated that conviction and remanded the case for the entry of a judgment of acquittal. The\\nCourt found that the State failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that defendant did not act in\\ndefense of another in shooting the victim. See State v. Cook, 204 W. Va. 591, 593-94, 515 S.E.2d\\n127, 129-30 (1999). The dispute between defense witness Frank Brent and Juror Victor Owens\\nallegedly occurred in 2011 and regarded whether petitioner had, in fact, committed the murder.\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cCircuit Court\\'. I mean, we never discussed this during trial.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Counsel: No, we didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t. But he may be, obviously prejudiced against\\nmy client if he feels that way about her. He should have raised his hand and said,\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cI can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be fair and impartial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d I mean if he feels so passionate about her and called\\nher a\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\nCircuit Court. You don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t know that he can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t, except you got an opinion from Frank\\nBrent that some time, in the past, they had an argument.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel also made a motion to replace Juror Owens with the alternate juror.\\nThe court denied that motion but said that if petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel obtained any more information,\\nhe should let the court know. Thereafter, the court instructed the jury, the parties made closing\\narguments, the court excused the alternate juror, and the jury began to deliberate.\\nAs the jurors deliberated, the court allowed petitioner to vouch the record regarding Mr.\\nBrent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims against Juror Owens. Thereafter, the State claimed that as soon as the sole alternate\\njuror was excused, s/he sat with petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supporters and was seen encouraging petitioner. The\\nState opined that the alternate juror was tainted and, therefore, had been properly excused the day\\nbefore. The State also speculated that Mr. Brent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claim regarding Juror Owens was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnothing more\\nthan a ruse to get rid of [a juror], so that [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] friend, the alternate would become one of\\nthe [jurors].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The court concurred that the alternate was \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctainted definitely by now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe\\xe2\\x80\\x99re\\ngoing to continue with [the jury] we have.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The court also noted, apparently in error, that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMr.\\nBrent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s father was a key witness in [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] acquittal [at her murder trial].\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nThe jury convicted petitioner on twenty-two of the fifty-nine counts: eight counts of\\nuttering and fourteen counts of obtaining money under false pretenses. The jury acquitted\\npetitioner on the remaining thirty-seven counts.\\nAt petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s June 6, 2019, sentencing hearing, her counsel again raised the issue of Juror\\nOwens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 alleged bias and asked that the court bring all the jurors back into court to determine\\nwhether Juror Owens had improperly influenced the jury during their deliberations. The court\\nreplied that it was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot going to start letting people interview jurors when they lose cases\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as it\\nwas \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagainst every rule we got.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The court also noted that petitioner was purely speculating that\\nJuror Owens had wrongfully influenced the jury. The State highlights that petitioner did not call\\nMr. Brent to testify regarding his claims about Juror Owens at her sentencing hearing.\\nBy order entered June 11, 2019, the circuit court ordered petitioner to pay restitution. The\\ncourt then sentenced petitioner to one to ten years in prison on each of the twenty-two counts, with\\ncounts one to seven to be served consecutively, and counts eight to twenty-two to be served\\nconcurrently, beginning on the date petitioner starts her sentence on the eighth count. Petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nnet effective sentence is eight to eighty years in prison.\\nPetitioner now appeals. Petitioner first argues that the circuit court erred by denying her\\nthe right to a fair trial when it failed to examine Juror Owens regarding his potential bias toward\\npetitioner and, instead, discharged the alternate juror and sent the case to the jury that included\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cJuror Owens.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe determination concerning whether and the extent to which to permit individual voir\\ndire rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and is not subject to review in the absence\\nof an abuse of discretion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d State v. Lassiter, 111 W. Va. 499, 503, 354 S.E.2d 595, 599 (1987)\\n(citing State v. Beacraft, 126 W.Va. 895, 30 S.E.2d 541 (1944); State v. Ashcraft, 172 W.Va. 640,\\n309 S.E.2d 600 (1983)).\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cA motion for a new trial on the ground of the misconduct of a jury is\\naddressed to the sound discretion of the court, which as a rule will not be disturbed\\non appeal where it appears that defendant was not injured by the misconduct or\\ninfluence complained of. The question as to whether or not a juror has been subjected\\nto improper influence affecting the verdict is a fact primarily to be determined by the\\ntrial judge from the circumstances, which must be clear and convincing to require a\\nnew trial; proof of mere opportunity to influence the jury being insufficient.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nSyllabus point 7, State v. Johnson, 111 W.Va. 653, 164 S.E. 31 (1932).\\nSyl. Pt. 1, State v. Daniel, 182 W. Va. 643, 391 S.E.2d 90 (1990).\\nWe first note that petitioner never brought Mr. Brent back into court following his March\\n27, 2019, testimony so that he could address the court regarding his alleged claims regarding Juror\\nOwens while petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial was still ongoing. Nor did the defense call Mr. Brent at petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nsentencing hearing when petitioner again complained about Juror Owens\\xe2\\x80\\x99s alleged bias.\\nPetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure to do so is significant. Absent such sworn testimony from Mr. Brent,\\npetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s claims are merely speculative and, as the State suggests, may have been falsely raised\\nin an effort to assist petitioner.\\nWe also find that the jury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s verdict further undermines petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s speculative claims. The\\njury, which included Juror Owens, acquitted petitioner of thirty-seven of the fifty-nine counts after\\nhearing all the evidence at trial. As for the twenty-two charges of which petitioner was convicted,\\nthe entire jury convicted her of those counts. Moreover, no juror informed the court that any one\\njuror had unduly influenced their deliberations or behaved contrary to the court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instructions.\\nAbsent any evidence other than Mr. Brent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unsubstantiated claims, we find that petitioner fails to\\nshow that she was prejudiced when the trial court rejected her motion to individually voir dire\\nJuror Owens. Accordingly, we find no error.\\nPetitioner next argues that the circuit court denied petitioner her right to a fair trial when it\\nfailed to allow petitioner to interview jurors other than Juror Owens to determine whether Juror\\nOwens\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bias against petitioner influenced the verdict. We have said, \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[a] jury verdict may not\\nordinarily be impeached based on matters that occur during the jury\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deliberative process which\\nmatters relate to the manner or means the jury uses to arrive at its verdict.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Syl. Pt. 1, State v.\\nScotchel, 168 W. Va. 545, 285 S.E.2d 384 (1981). As noted above, petitioner did not raise her\\nclaim regarding Juror Owens until the close of all evidence and never produced Mr. Brent so that\\nhe could verify his claims. Further, the alleged incident supposedly happened in 2011, eight years\\nprior to petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trial. In its post-trial order, the circuit court noted that it did \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot desire to\\nquestion . . . [JJuror [Owens] ... on matters . . . which if they occurred at all, happened remote in\\n5\\n\\n\\x0ctime to this jury trial.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Petitioner also fails to show that she was specifically prejudiced by the\\ncircuit court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ruling. Thus, we find that the circuit court did not err in denying petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion\\nto voir dire the other jurors regarding Juror Owens.\\nIn petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s third assignment of error, she argues that the circuit court erred in admitting\\nevidence of the additional 148 checks deposited into petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit card accounts as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother\\nacts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence under Rule 404(b) of the West Virginia Rules of Evidence.\\nThis Court reviews a lower court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s determination regarding the introduction\\nof Rule 404(b) other crimes evidence under an abuse of discretion standard. [State\\nv.] McGinnis, 193 W.Va. [147,] at 159, 455 S.E.2d [516,] at 528 [(1994)]. We have\\nemphasized that a circuit court abuses its discretion in admitting Rule 404(b)\\nevidence only where the court acts in an \\xe2\\x80\\x9carbitrary and irrational\\xe2\\x80\\x9d manner. Id.\\nState v. Hager, 204 W. Va. 28, 36, 511 S.E.2d 139, 147 (1998). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn reviewing the admission of\\nRule 404(b) evidence, we review in the light most favorable to the party offering the evidence . ..\\nmaximizing its probative value and minimizing its prejudicial effect.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d State v. Willett, 223 W. Va.\\n394, 397, 674 S.E.2d 602, 605 (2009).\\nAs noted above, prior to trial, the State moved to admit 148 checks, totaling $116,628.89\\non 96 Guild accounts that were deposited into petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit card accounts for which petitioner\\nwas not charged. Over petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objection, the circuit court granted the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motion and\\nallowed Gwen Grove, an investigator from the Department of Health and Human Services\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\nInspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office, to testify regarding the checks as proof of intent, motive, common\\nscheme, plan, or absence of mistake.\\nThe standard of review for a trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s admission of evidence pursuant to\\nRule 404(b) involves a three-step analysis. First, we review for clear error the trial\\ncourt\\xe2\\x80\\x99s factual determination that there is sufficient evidence to show the other acts\\noccurred. Second, we review de novo whether the trial court correctly found the\\nevidence was admissible for a legitimate purpose. Third, we review for an abuse of\\ndiscretion the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conclusion that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother acts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence is more\\nprobative than prejudicial under Rule 403.\\nState v. Taylor, 215 W. Va. 74, 78, 593 S.E.2d 645, 649 (2004) (quoting State v. LaRock, 196\\nW.Va. 294, 310-11, 470 S.E.2d 613, 629-30 (1996) (footnote omitted)). Under Rule 403 of the\\nWest Virginia Rules of Evidence, relevant evidence \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmay [be] exclude[d]... if its probative value\\nis substantially outweighed by a danger of. . . unfair prejudice[.]\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nHere, the circuit court conducted a Rule 404(b) hearing and instructed the jury on the\\nlimited admissibility of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother acts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence. However, petitioner argues that the court abused its\\ndiscretion on step three of the Rule 404(b) test (whether the evidence was more probative than\\nprejudicial). Specifically, petitioner argues that the volume of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cother acts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence produced by\\nthe State far exceeded the conduct charged and, therefore, was unfairly prejudicial, and used to\\nenhance the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case, and not to prove intent, motive, common scheme, plan, or absence of\\nmistake.\\n6\\n\\n*\\xc2\\xbb\\n\\n\\x0cOur review of the record on appeal does not indicate that the State introduced the Rule\\n404(b) evidence to prejudice the jury against petitioner; instead, the State used that evidence to\\ncounter an issue petitioner interjected into the case: that petitioner was being prosecuted because\\nshe discovered that the Guild was committing Medicaid fraud and was \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpaying her back\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for being\\na whistleblower. Therefore, because the Rule 404(b) evidence was used for a probative and\\nrelevant purpose, we find that the circuit court did not err in allowing the evidence for the purposes\\nof showing petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s motive, opportunity, intent, common scheme, and plan.\\nThe circuit court also did not err in precluding petitioner from entering her rebuttal\\nevidence where petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s counsel did not give the three-ring notebook containing that evidence\\nto the State until a week before trial and well after discovery had closed. Petitioner testified that\\nshe had been in possession of the information in the notebook since December of 2012, well before\\npetitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s March of 2019 trial. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDiscovery orders lie within the sound discretion of a trial court.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\nBartles v. Hinkle, 196 W. Va. 381, 389, 472 S.E.2d 827, 835 (1996). Based on the facts herein, we\\nfind the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to allow petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rebuttal evidence\\nat trial.\\nIn petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fourth assignment of error, she claims that the circuit court erred in barring\\nher evidence that her office computer at the Guild had allegedly been tampered with in order to\\nmanufacture evidence against her.\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe action of a trial court in admitting or excluding evidence in the exercise of its\\ndiscretion will not be disturbed by the appellate court unless it appears that such action amounts\\nto an abuse of discretion.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Syl. Pt. 1, State v. Calloway, 207 W. Va. 43, 528 S.E.2d 490 (1999)\\n(citing Syl. Pt. 10, State v. Huffman, 141 W. Va. 55, 87 S.E.2d 541 (1955), overruled on other\\ngrounds, State ex rel. R.L. v. Bedell, 192 W. Va. 435, 452 S.E.2d 893 (1994)).\\nPetitioner states that, at trial, she attempted to show that the evidence against her was\\nmanufactured after she left her employment at the Guild, but before the DHHR conducted its\\ninvestigation, a period of about a month. In support, petitioner offered the testimony of the Guild\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nIT manager, Brandon Judy, and a forensic computer expert, Craig Corkrean. At trial, the court\\nallowed petitioner to question Mr. Judy, but, when petitioner was two-thirds through her\\nexamination, the court stopped the examination on the ground that the documentary evidence was\\nnot computer-generated. The court also precluded Mr. Corkrean from testifying. Petitioner\\nhighlights that a pretrial order allowed Mr. Corkrean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony; and that Mr. Corkrean was to\\naddress an issue that was not addressed by Mr. Judy, i.e., whether anyone manipulated petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ncomputer after she left her employment with the Guild. Petitioner contends that Mr. Corkrean\\nwould have testified that after petitioner left the Guild, (1) her computer was kept in operation; (2)\\nher computer was repeatedly accessed; (3) one of the contracts on her computer was accessed three\\ntimes; and (4) he found two Medicaid fraud reports even though the State claimed it found no such\\nreports on petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer. Petitioner avers that this testimony could have shown the\\ndeficiency in the Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report.\\nPetitioner avers that she discovered that the Guild was wrongfully using the funds from the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFamily Support Contract\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to pay operational expenses, which amounted to Medicaid fraud.\\nPetitioner contends that, when the court disallowed Mr. Corkrean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s testimony, she was precluded\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cfrom proving her theory that, after she left the Guild, Guild workers used her office computer to\\nmanufacture evidence against her in retaliation for her discovery of the Guild\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fraudulent activity.\\nWe find that the circuit court did not err in disallowing petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 evidence. An April 2,\\n2019, order in this case explains that,\\nDuring [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] Mr. Judy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s . . . testimony, the State objected on\\nrelevance. The [c]ourt sustained the objection[.] The State argued that any access\\nto [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] work computer after [petitioner] was terminated from [the Guild]\\nwas irrelevant because all of the documentation used in the prosecution of this\\nmatter was retrieved from the physical files that day before [petitioner] was\\nterminated [and a month after she was suspended from work]. Petitioner objected\\nto that characterization and claimed that she was set up by the other employees and\\ndocuments were altered after she left her employment. Petitioner likewise argued\\nthat her [forensic computer] expert witness [Mr. Corkrean would] testify to post\\xc2\\xad\\ntermination logins of [her] work computer and that those logins are part of the basis\\nof the claim that she was set up by other employees. The evidence that was\\npresented by the State which was unchallenged by [petitioner] on direct is that the\\ndocuments that serve as the basis for the indictment were collected and preserved\\non December 5, 2012 [when petitioner was suspended, but a month before she was\\nterminated]. Therefore, the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objection is sustained on the issue. Furthermore,\\nbased upon [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] failure to show any alterations of the computer by anyone\\nother than [petitioner] prior to her termination from [the Guild], the [c]ourt finds\\nthat the testimony of [Mr. Corkrean] is unnecessary and irrelevant. Accordingly,\\nwitness Judy was dismissed from the stand and . . . Mr. Corkrean, will not be\\npermitted to testify in this matter.\\nMoreover, the following exchange occurred between the court and petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expert, Mr. Judy,\\nat trial:\\nThe Court: [Mr. Judy], let me ask you this question. Do you have any evidence that\\n[petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s] computer while she was employed [with the Guild] was tampered\\nwith in any way?\\nMr. Judy. I do not have any evidence.\\nThe Court: Do you have any evidence or knowledge that [petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s computer]\\nwas tampered with inappropriately after she left [the Guild]?\\nMr. Judy. I do not.\\nBased on our review of the trial court\\xe2\\x80\\x99s thorough findings and Mr. Judy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s answers, we find no\\nerror.\\nIn her fifth assignment of error, petitioner argues that the circuit court erred in prohibiting\\na defense witness, investigator Glen Cook, from testifying about the sufficiency of the Inspector\\nGeneral\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigation regarding petitioner. At trial, Mr. Cook testified to his experience as a\\n8\\n\\n\\x0cprivate investigator, and to his thirty-one years in law enforcement as an investigator. Thereafter,\\nthe court excluded Mr. Cook from testifying about the sufficiency of the Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\ninvestigation. Petitioner claims that, as a result, she could not show the investigation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deficiencies.\\nPetitioner argues that, even if Mr. Cook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s background did not qualify him to give a formal expert\\nopinion, the trial court should have allowed Mr. Cook to testify as to (1) what he would have done\\ndifferently if he had conducted the investigation; (2) whether witness statements were obtained in\\na manner consistent with his law enforcement training; and (3) what the data on the computer\\nshowed in the forensic investigation.\\nThe record on appeal shows that the Inspector General\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investigator fully testified\\nregarding her investigation. The sufficiency of that investigation was a question for the jury. We\\nhave held that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x98[t]he jury is the trier of the facts and in performing that duty it is the sole judge as\\nto the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Syl. Pt. 2, State v. Bailey, 151\\nW.Va. 796, 155 S.E.2d 850 (1967).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Syl. Pt. 8, State v. McGilton, 229 W. Va. 554, 729 S.E.2d\\n876 (2012) (citing Syl. Pt. 2, State v. Martin, 224 W. Va. 577, 687 S.E.2d 360 (2009)). Thus, the\\ncourt did not err in precluding Mr. Cook from opining about any alleged \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeficiencies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the\\ninvestigation or what he would have done differently.\\nIn her sixth and final assignment of error, petitioner argues that her sentence violates the\\nproportionality rule in Article III, Section 5 of the West Virginia Constitution because it is\\nimpermissibly and shockingly harsh and disproportionate to the facts in this case. Petitioner notes\\nthat she is sixty years old, has no prior convictions, and paid restitution in full. She also claims that\\nshe was singled out for prosecution because she investigated and uncovered the Guild\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fraud.\\nThus, petitioner argues that the sentence is shocking and disproportionate to the offense, and based\\non impermissible factors, i.e., that she rejected a plea agreement and pursued a jury trial. Petitioner\\nhighlights that, under the plea offer, petitioner could have filed a Rule 35(b) motion for reduction\\nof sentence with no opposition from the State and could have been released on probation after\\nserving only eight months in jail. She further claims that this wide gap between the proposed\\nsentence and the actual sentence shows that factors other than petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offenses influenced the\\ncourt.\\nThere are two tests to determine whether a sentence is so disproportionate\\nto a crime that it violates our constitution. Accord, Stockton v. Leeke, 269 S.C. 459,\\n237 S.E.2d 896, 897 (1977). The first is subjective and asks whether the sentence\\nfor the particular crime shocks the conscience of the court and society. If a sentence\\nis so offensive that it cannot pass a societal and judicial sense ofjustice, the inquiry\\nneed not proceed further. When it cannot be said that a sentence shocks the\\nconscience, a disproportionality challenge is guided by the objective test we spelled\\nout in Syllabus Point 5 of Wanstreet v. Bordenkircher, 166 W.Va. 523, 276 S E 2d\\n205 (1981):\\nIn determining whether a given sentence violates the\\nproportionality principle found in Article III, Section 5 of the West\\nVirginia Constitution, consideration is given to the nature of the\\noffense, the legislative purpose behind the punishment, a\\ncomparison of the punishment with what would be inflicted in other\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cjurisdictions, and a comparison with other offenses within the same\\njurisdiction.\\nState v. Cooper, 172 W. Va. 266, 272, 304 S.E.2d 851, 857 (1983).\\nThe jury found petitioner guilty of twenty-two felony counts, yet she will be eligible for\\nparole after serving only eight years in prison. Clearly, such a sentence is not impermissible,\\nshockingly harsh, or disproportionate. As for the amount of money petitioner unlawfully obtained,\\n$22,400, it is of no matter. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuttering\\xe2\\x80\\x9d statute says nothing about a dollar amount. Further, the\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cobtaining money\\xe2\\x80\\x9d by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfalse pretenses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d statute, West Virginia Code \\xc2\\xa7 61-3-24(a)(3), mandates\\nthat the dollar amount need be only $1,000 or more, which was satisfied in petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case. As\\nfor petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age, there is nothing in the relevant law regarding a defendant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age at sentencing.\\nFurther, petitioner presents no evidence that the State prosecuted her because she investigated and\\nuncovered Medicaid fraud by the Guild. Instead, the State prosecuted petitioner because she used\\nher position at the Guild to illegally divert money into her credit card accounts. As for petitioner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\nclaim that her sentence is disproportionate because the court relied on impermissible factors in\\nsentencing her, i.e., her rejection of the State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s plea offer and the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chad acts\\xe2\\x80\\x9d evidence admitted by\\nthe State against her, petitioner enters no evidence in support. Thus, we reject this assignment of\\nerror.\\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the June 11, 2019, order of the Circuit Court of Grant\\nCounty.\\nAffirmed.\\nISSUED: December 16, 2020\\nCONCURRED IN BY:\\nChief Justice Tim Armstead\\nJustice Elizabeth D.
