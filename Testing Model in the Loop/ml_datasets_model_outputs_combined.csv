In conclusion:
• 
The NCAA is not a sports league.
• 
The NCAA is not a production joint venture.
• 
Amateur college sports can exist without the 
NCAA.
• 
The NCAA facilitates a member conference 
cartel over college athletes.
The upshot of these conclusions is that the “joint 
venture” NCAA, designed and implemented by member 
conferences and independents, is a price fixing 
cartel over college athletes. The collusion of member 
conferences and independents to fix this input price is 
not necessary for member conferences and independents 
to fulfill their necessary function of creating conference 
and independent play. While most of the debate is about 
the fairness to athletes, economics adds that there 
are efficiency losses to this cartel behavior and that 
removing the cartel actually produces efficiency gains 
that the courts are not considering yet.
Amici urge the Court to add these conclusions from 
the economic analysis of sports and reject the erroneous 
“joint venture” plea by the NCAA.
It is in the interests of society that the full array of 
antitrust relief be considered in any joint venture activity 
arousing suspicion of anticompetitive behavior. The 
demands that no further rule of reason “burden” be put 
upon “the NCAA”, and that member conferences acting 
via their NCAA deserve even more antitrust leniency, are 
unsupported by economic findings.",other,part-affirm part-deny,1) Relevant Economic Research on College Sports 2) The NCAA Is Not a Sports League 3) The NCAA Is Not a College Sports Production Joint Venture 4) Amateur College Sports Can Exist Without the NCAA 5) The NCAA Facilitates a Cartel Over College Athletes,"  Conclusion: Reverse

The conclusion of the legal brief argues that the NCAA is a price-fixing cartel over college athletes, and that the collusion of member conferences and independents to fix this input price is not necessary for them to fulfill their necessary function of creating conference and independent play. The brief urges the court to reject the NCAA's ""joint venture"" plea and consider the full array of antitrust relief in any joint venture activity that arouses suspicion of anticompetitive behavior.",  Classification: Part-affirm part-deny,"Arguments:

that ANCs do not meet the definition of 
""Tribal governments"" eligible to receive 
Title V CARES Act funding, which is 
consistent with Title V's structure of 
funding sovereign entities and their 
political subdivisions 
3 
The Secretary's interpretation of the 
CARES Act results in double counting 
segments of Alaska's population, 
unfairly directing funds to the ANCs at 
the expense of federally recognized

Amici States and the recognized tribes within 
their borders are striving, through their CARES Act 
Title V funding allocation, to serve the needs of all 
their citizens and members. And they are doing so 
with an allocation of funds based upon their popula-
tions. The Secretary's interpretation of the CARES 
Act and ISDA is incorrect as a matter of statutory con-
struction, and it deprives the recognized tribes of the 
full amount of funds to which they are entitled to 
serve their members.

4. The impact of ANCSA on federal recognition of Alaska Native entities was not realized until the 1990s.

Therefore, the argument in the brief can be summarized as: The ISDEAA did not establish a clear and consistent process for federal recognition of Indian tribes, and the status of Alaska Native tribes remained uncertain until the 1990s.","I. WHEN THE ISDEAA WAS PASSED, THERE WAS NO OFFICIAL LIST OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES, NO UNIVERSAL CRITERIA FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION, AND NO FORMAL PROCESS FOR MAKING RECOGNITION DECISIONS
A. The Term “Indian Tribes” in the U.S. Constitution Has Been Broadly Interpreted, and Federal Courts Have Deferred to Congress’ and the Executive Branch’s Changing Recognition Decisions
B. In the Early Twentieth Century, Congress and the Executive Branch Sought to Reverse the Impacts of Federal Assimilationist Policies Through Reconstituting and Reviving Tribal Governments
C. At the Time of ISDEAA, the Administrative Process and Criteria for Recognizing Indian Tribes was Still in Flux
II. THE STATUS OF ALASKA NATIVE TRIBES REMAINED UNCERTAIN LONG AFTER ISDEAA WAS ENACTED
A. Prior to the Adoption of ANCSA, the History of Alaska Native’s Interactions with the Federal Government is Similar to that of Indian Tribes in the Lower 48 States
B. The Impact of ANCSA on Federal Recognition of Alaska Native entities was not Realized Until the 1990s",True,AFFIRM

86. Stone Creek asserts claims for federal and com-
mon law trademark infringement and Lanham 
Act unfair competition. 
87. A trademark is any word, name, symbol, device, or 
any combination thereof, used by a person to iden-
tify and distinguish that person’s goods from those 
of others and to indicate the source of the goods, 
even if that source is generally unknown. 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1127. 
88. “A trademark is a limited property right in a par-
ticular word, phrase or symbol.” New Kids on the 
Block v. New Am. Pub., Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th 
Cir. 1992). It identifies the source of goods. 
Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Entm’t Corp., 
174 F.3d 1036, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). 
89. To prevail on its trademark infringement and un-
fair competition claims, Stone Creek must show: 
(1) it owns a valid mark; (2) the mark was used 
without its consent; and (3) such unauthorized use 
is likely to cause confusion among ordinary con-
sumers as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or 
approval of the goods. See Credit One Corp. v. 
Credit One Fin., Inc., 661 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137

3. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony of Dr. Charles Cowan, Omnia's survey expert, because Stone Creek's rule 26 and hearsay objections have no merit. (Argument V)

Therefore, the arguments in the brief can be summarized as:

* Stone Creek is not entitled to disgorgement of Omnia's profits because of Omnia's lack of willful infringement.
* Stone Creek is not entitled to disgorgement of Omnia's profits because the infringing sales were not attributable to Omnia's infringement.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

1. The First Amendment implicates ballot access for initiatives and regulates political speech, which triggers strict scrutiny under Meyer-Buckley.
2. Under Anderson-Burdick, the in-person collection laws are unconstitutional as applied during a pandemic, as they impose a severe burden on circulators without a compelling state interest.
3. Injunctive relief is required to remedy Thompson's injury, as the preliminary injunction factors weigh in favor of granting equitable relief, and the district court did not abuse its discretion by awarding Thompson a negative preliminary injunction.

Therefore, the arguments in the legal brief can be summarized as:

1. The First Amendment protects the right to circulate ballot initiatives, and Ohio's laws regulating ballot access are subject to strict scrutiny.
2. The in-person collection laws are unconstitutional as applied during a pandemic, as they impose an undue burden on circulators without a compelling state interest.

Amicus draws the attention of this Court to the 
crucial role of natural immunity in addressing not 
only Petitioners’ significant protected interests, but 
also those same interests of the public during this 
period of declared (but not currently scientifically 
validated) pandemic accompanied by untenable 
medical interventions. This Court ought to take 
notice, as well, that the President seeks to indirectly 
mandate EUA inoculations through employers, 
despite the settled jurisprudence that the States 
alone have such police power (if it exists), and the 
settled jurisprudence of this Court that all human 
beings have a right to informed consent and bodily 
integrity.  
Shall the most serious public health challenge in 
several generations be resolved by executive action 
and by private mandates under color of law without 
meaningful judicial review under the strict scrutiny 
standard? 
 Amicus respectfully requests that this Court 
grant the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus, or in the 
alternative, Certification, in the public interest and 
to protect the interests of the Petitioners and Amicus’ 
associates.

The AMA and MSSNY sympathize with the Gover-
nor, who must balance public health with civil liberties 
in a difficult and fast-changing pandemic, and with the 
Diocese, which sincerely believes in the importance 
of its mission and has taken measures to mitigate 
the risk of its services. While the AMA and MSSNY 
recognize that this case cannot be decided by science 
alone, they believe that the Court’s understanding of 
the science should be as accurate as possible. The 
science indicates that even with protective measures 
in place, attending a religious service is inherently 
risky, that its risk is comparable to that of activities 
prohibited in New York’s red and orange zones, and 
that this risk cannot be eliminated.

If there is one belief widely held among the diverse faiths that Americans hold, 
it is the great value that they place on human life. E.g., Deuteronomy 30:19–20. The 
precious right to worship freely should not be misapplied in a manner that 
contributes to the spread of disease, suffering, and death. For to do so would defeat 
the very purpose of that right: “The dead cannot praise the Lord.” Psalms 115:17.

based considerations, while at the same time showing special solicitude—not 
disfavor—for religious institutions and their worship service",affirm,Part-affirm part-deny,ARGUMENT A: 1) The Free Exercise Clause does not require a religious exemption here because granting one would gravely harm numerous people.    a) This Court has never granted an exemption under the Free Exercise Clause when doing so would inflict substantial harm on people beyond the applicant.    b) Requiring a religious exemption from New York’s Order would inflict severe harm on countless other people.

COVID-19 is a serious public health threat. It has already killed almost a 
quarter of a million Americans. There is a consensus among public health experts

Court of the United States and Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit

Movants Senator Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola, members of the 
Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Caucus, respectfully seek leave to file the 
accompanying brief as amici curiae in opposition to the emergency Application for 
Writ of Injunction Pending the filing and Disposition of a Petition for a Writ of 
Certiorari filed in the above-captioned matter. 
 
Amici curiae Senators Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola submit this 
motion and accompanying brief.  Senators Costa and Boscola submit that members 
iii 
of the General Assembly voted in support of and in opposition to the legislation 
that was ultimately enacted as Act 77.1  Senators Costa and Boscola seek to present 
herein and in the accompanying brief a unique perspective concerning the actions 
of the General Assembly in the enactment of Act 77 and the requirement that the 
enactment be granted the customary broad presumption of constitutionality 
concerning both the procedures used in its enactment as well as the 
constitutionality of the act itself.   Pursuant to its broad grant of plenary legislative 
authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the General Assembly acted in 
compliance with state constitutional provisions concerning the enactment of Act 77 
that included, inter alia, expanded voting opportunities through the use of “mail-in 
ballots.” 
 
Amici curiae also requests permission to file its proposed brief on 8 ½ inch 
by 11 inch paper pursuant to Rule 33.2.  Applicants’ emergency petition seeks the 
Court’s immediate intervention and time does not allow for the printing of booklets 
under rule 33.1.  Accordingly, amici respectfully move this Court to accept the 
filing of its amicus brief using the format specified in Rule 33.2. 
 
1 The legislation that was eventually enacted as Act 77 of 2019 was introduced as Senate 
Bill 421 in the 2019-2020 legislative session by Sen. Lisa Boscola.  The legislation, amended in 
the House of Representatives to include Mail-In Ballots was approved by bipartisan votes of 138 
to 61 in the House and 35 to 14 in the Senate.  The Governor signed the bill into law as Act 77 
on October 31, 2019.  See Pa. Act of Oct. 31, 2019, No. 77, P.L. 552, Cl. 25, S.B. 421.

For these reasons, amici curiae respectfully request the Court’s leave to file 
the attached amicus curiae brief containing 1,562 words, and for leave to file the 
brief pursuant to Rule 33.2.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",The conclusion can be categorized as'remand'. This is due to the fact that the argument made in this conclusion relates to the continuation or re-examination of a case. They are requesting for a 'writ of certiorari' to be granted because they believe the outcome of this case has significant consequences and people may suffer tangible harm if the California Attorney General's unlawful practice is not corrected.,Part-affirm part-reverse,"The following are the explicitly stated arguments from the table of contents:  1.

This Court has held that compelled disclosure can 
violate associational rights guaranteed under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To 
protect these rights, this Court has developed a test 
that it described as strict. The lower courts, however, 
and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
here, have applied a diluted version of this Court’s 
test, permitting compelled disclosure in nearly all 
circumstances. To respect the Framers’ defense of 
speaking without disclosing the identity of the 
speaker, to restore the Framers’ view of compelled 
disclosure with “just Alarm,” to provide clarity and 
predictability to states, courts, and speakers, and 
because compelled disclosure has recently caused 
harm to First Amendment associational rights, this 
Court should, as Petitioners urge, apply strict 
scrutiny.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision seriously undermines 
the rights of speech and association. Considering the 
historical constancy of governmental abuse and how 
donors are exposed to significant doxxing risks, this

should 
hold 
that

including a meaningful requirement of narrow

For the reasons stated above, this Court should

nors does not satisfy strict scrutiny, reverse the Ninth",remand,Part-affirm part-reverse,"The explicitly stated arguments from the table of contents are as follows:  1.

The Ninth Circuit's decision conflicts with the court's precedent protecting private associations from compelled disclosure. 4. The Ninth Circuit applied the wrong level of scrutiny due to the multiplicity of tests called ""exacting scrutiny.""     a. Strict scrutiny applies to burdens on charitable solicitation.     b.

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",affirm,part-affirm part-deny,"I.

Because religious liberty is the first and foremost 
of 
our 
God-given 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution, it is entirely appropriate that this 
Court invoke the First Amendment to establish that 
church employment matters are exempt from 
government control.  By so doing, the Court can 
extricate itself from the quagmire of having to 
perpetually examine church doctrine, tradition, and 
polity to determine who is and is not a minister for 
purposes of a ministerial exception. 
 
If the Court is not willing to take that step, the 
Foundation urges the Court to defer to the 
determinations of church authorities that their 
employees are ministers absent compelling reasons to 
the contrary.

The Ninth Circuit’s approach in Biel and

decision in Hosanna-Tabor and the intent of the

should reject that faulty approach and endorse that 
followed by the other circuits, which considers the 
function performed by the religious organization’s 
employee and whether that function is religiously 
important. To avoid impermissible interference in

defer to the religious organization’s sincerely held

In the end, the best protection for religious 
liberty is to vindicate the separation between church 
and state that the ministerial exception doctrine 
vindicates by recognizing separate spheres of 
competence:  a civil jurisdiction independent from 
the 
church 
and 
an 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction 
independent from the state in relation to religious 
matters.  By its nature, the ministerial exception 
doctrine is jurisdictional, not an affirmative defense.  
To assess the applicability of the doctrine in reaction 
to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no test can answer every 
question with fidelity to the First Amendment if that 
test is applied in a rigid and insensitive manner. The 
nature of the dispute must always be considered; 
regardless of the employee’s duties.  A religious 
organization may have a religious basis for the 
termination of employment that is protected by the 
First Amendment.  Whatever test they employ, the 
lower courts should be instructed to tread with 
caution 
and 
to 
consider 
carefully 
whether 
adjudicating the issues raised by the particular 
dispute will entangle the court in matters of faith.    
The Court can come closer to the ideal with a more 
sensitive, flexible and principled test.",Classification: Other,The classification for this conclusion is other.,"The explicitly stated arguments from the table of contents are:  1.

The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-
tomary international law prohibition against slavery 
applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action 
under the ATS against domestic corporations for  
violating that norm. The judgment of the court of  
appeals should be affirmed.

United States courts are an appropriate forum to

child slavery. Such conduct is no less horrendous and 
no less deserving of redress when the enslaved 
children are forced to labor outside our shores.

matter, lower courts have routinely heard civil actions against

The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility 
 
14 See Brief for the Private Petitioners at 2 (“The simple

religious beliefs through a mandate that admits of exceptions

Counsel for Amicus Curiae",reverse,Part-reverse,"The table of contents presents several explicitly stated arguments. Some include:  1. The ACA (Affordable Care Act) includes no intelligible principle to guide the agencies in determining what ""additional preventive care"" they should mandate. 2.

Rules that reduce the scope of regulatory reach raise fewer self-governance concerns when agencies undertake lawmaking functions that were vested in Congress. 4. Interpreting the ACA to limit agencies' authority to expand relief from the contraceptive mandate undercuts the Constitution's and RFRA's protections for religious Americans. 5. The Constitution securies religious liberty of Americans both through the First Amendment and by vesting ""all legislative powers"" in Congress. 6.

Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.

Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.

The Twelfth Amendment did not affect electors' autonomy, and the amendment's text does not authorize interference with elector autonomy.","INTERESTS OF AMICUS

It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments
of the Second and D.C. Circuits and order entry of the
injunctions the President requests.",reverse,part-affirm part-reverse,"The explicitly stated arguments from the table of contents are:  1.

1. The subpoenas should be quashed because they will cause serious distraction and diversion from Presidential duties.
	* The subpoenas are too broad and will require the President's ongoing attention, making it difficult for him to perform his duties.
	* The subpoenas are different from previous ones allowed by the court because of their virtually limitless scope.
	* The rationales employed by the Second and D.C. Circuits are misplaced.
	* The subpoenas violate the spirit of Article II and undermine a significant aspect of the 2016 Presidential election.
2. In 19-635, the subpoena should be quashed because state and local authorities may not issue process that impairs the President's ability to perform his official duties.

* The subpoenas violate the spirit of Article II and undermine a significant aspect of the 2016 Presidential election.
* State and local authorities may not issue process that impairs the President's ability to perform his official duties.

For its 230 year history, this Court has heeded 
Judge Montesquieu’s warning about legislative 
overreach working attainder. When any legislative 
body has defaming, punishment power, “the life and 
liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary 
control.”41

Over the course of a decade, the ACA has 
fundamentally reshaped the nation’s health care

paradigm shift—including the promise of affordable 
coverage for those with preexisting conditions—when

Like the poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim 
Crow era, modern voter suppression efforts are relent-
less and effective. H.B. 2023 is one such effort, adopted 
in Arizona based on demonstrably false claims of voter 
fraud for the specific purpose of stopping a practice 
used predominately in minority communities. See 
DNC, 948 F.3d at 1037 (“[I]f some Arizonans today dis-
trust third-party ballot collection, it is because of the 
fraudulent campaign mounted by proponents of H.B. 
2023. . . . To the degree that there has been any fraud, 
it has been the false and race-based claims of the pro-
ponents of H.B. 2023”). This Court should affirm the 
Ninth Circuit’s en banc opinion.

The
Secretary
of
HHS’s
approvals
of
the
Arkansas and New Hampshire waiver programs were
arbitrary and capricious. If allowed to go forward,
these programs would deliver a crushing blow to low-
income adults in Arkansas and New Hampshire,
leaving
tens
of
thousands
without
health
care
coverage. As that result flouts the objectives of the
Medicaid program, Amici respectfully request that
this Court affirm the District of Columbia Circuit’s
judgments. In the alternative, Amici request that this
Court grant the Federal Petitioners’ motion to vacate
the judgments below and remand with instructions
that the approvals be remanded to HHS.

The devastation of the Bayou Corne sinkhole is 
apparent, and the resulting litigation up to this point 
has been staggering. While substantial in volume, the 
facts of this case are not overly complex. Considering 
the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that the 
Oxy entities, the Texas Brine entities, and Vulcan are 
each allocated a portion of responsibility for the 
damages occasioned by the Bayou Corne sinkhole 
under Civil Code Articles 2315 and 2317.1. 
Although all internal data from the OG3 cavern 
indicated current stability when Vulcan sold their 
interests to OxyChem, Vulcan’s negligence in failing 
to facilitate recommended studies to further define 
the edge of the Salt Dome before doubling production, 
which moved the cavern closer to the edge",Classification: Affirm,part-affirm part-reverse,"1.

1. The First Circuit's use of an unwritten geographic quota to assign civil appellate panels violates Article 2164.1 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure and Louisiana Revised Statutes § 13:319.

The district court committed an error at the very 
least in their commanded remedy. The district court 
was asked to prevent the President of the United 
States from using anything other than the total 
population of the United States to apportion 
congressional 
seats. 
The 
Congressional 
apportionment occurs at the second step of the 
census reporting statute, and the district court’s 
order did not properly assess the first step of the 
process.  
 
The district court improperly prevented the 
Secretary from even reporting information to the 
President at step one. Regardless of how this Court 
decides the merits of the case at step two, this Court 
should never prevent the Secretary of Commerce 
from reporting the number of U.S. citizens living in 
the United States and the number of those persons 
residing in the United States without authorization. 
This information is critically important, especially 
for legislatures as they embark on their sovereign 
function of drawing districts for the following 
decade.
