The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania

Amicus draws the attention of this Court to the 
crucial role of natural immunity in addressing not 
only Petitioners’ significant protected interests, but 
also those same interests of the public during this 
period of declared (but not currently scientifically 
validated) pandemic accompanied by untenable 
medical interventions. This Court ought to take 
notice, as well, that the President seeks to indirectly 
mandate EUA inoculations through employers, 
despite the settled jurisprudence that the States 
alone have such police power (if it exists), and the 
settled jurisprudence of this Court that all human 
beings have a right to informed consent and bodily 
integrity.  
Shall the most serious public health challenge in 
several generations be resolved by executive action 
and by private mandates under color of law without 
meaningful judicial review under the strict scrutiny 
standard? 
 Amicus respectfully requests that this Court 
grant the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus, or in the 
alternative, Certification, in the public interest and 
to protect the interests of the Petitioners and Amicus’ 
associates.

In conclusion:
• 
The NCAA is not a sports league.
• 
The NCAA is not a production joint venture.
• 
Amateur college sports can exist without the 
NCAA.
• 
The NCAA facilitates a member conference 
cartel over college athletes.
The upshot of these conclusions is that the “joint 
venture” NCAA, designed and implemented by member 
conferences and independents, is a price fixing 
cartel over college athletes. The collusion of member 
conferences and independents to fix this input price is 
not necessary for member conferences and independents 
to fulfill their necessary function of creating conference 
and independent play. While most of the debate is about 
the fairness to athletes, economics adds that there 
are efficiency losses to this cartel behavior and that 
removing the cartel actually produces efficiency gains 
that the courts are not considering yet.
Amici urge the Court to add these conclusions from 
the economic analysis of sports and reject the erroneous 
“joint venture” plea by the NCAA.
It is in the interests of society that the full array of 
antitrust relief be considered in any joint venture activity 
arousing suspicion of anticompetitive behavior. The 
demands that no further rule of reason “burden” be put 
upon “the NCAA”, and that member conferences acting 
via their NCAA deserve even more antitrust leniency, are 
unsupported by economic findings.",http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20-512/171571/20210310171709349_001_Brief_1707.pdf,False,OTHER,3.0,da2985

86. Stone Creek asserts claims for federal and com-
mon law trademark infringement and Lanham 
Act unfair competition. 
87. A trademark is any word, name, symbol, device, or 
any combination thereof, used by a person to iden-
tify and distinguish that person’s goods from those 
of others and to indicate the source of the goods, 
even if that source is generally unknown. 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1127. 
88. “A trademark is a limited property right in a par-
ticular word, phrase or symbol.” New Kids on the 
Block v. New Am. Pub., Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th 
Cir. 1992). It identifies the source of goods. 
Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Entm’t Corp., 
174 F.3d 1036, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). 
89. To prevail on its trademark infringement and un-
fair competition claims, Stone Creek must show: 
(1) it owns a valid mark; (2) the mark was used 
without its consent; and (3) such unauthorized use 
is likely to cause confusion among ordinary con-
sumers as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or 
approval of the goods. See Credit One Corp. v.

 ","CONCLUSION  
 
This Court has held that compelled disclosure can 
violate associational rights guaranteed under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To 
protect these rights, this Court has developed a test 
that it described as strict. The lower courts, however, 
and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
here, have applied a diluted version of this Court’s 
test, permitting compelled disclosure in nearly all 
circumstances. To respect the Framers’ defense of 
speaking without disclosing the identity of the 
speaker, to restore the Framers’ view of compelled 
disclosure with “just Alarm,” to provide clarity and 
predictability to states, courts, and speakers, and 
because compelled disclosure has recently caused 
harm to First Amendment associational rights, this

Because religious liberty is the first and foremost 
of 
our 
God-given 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution, it is entirely appropriate that this 
Court invoke the First Amendment to establish that 
church employment matters are exempt from 
government control.  By so doing, the Court can 
extricate itself from the quagmire of having to 
perpetually examine church doctrine, tradition, and 
polity to determine who is and is not a minister for 
purposes of a ministerial exception. 
 
If the Court is not willing to take that step, the 
Foundation urges the Court to defer to the 
determinations of church authorities that their 
employees are ministers absent compelling reasons to 
the contrary.

The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-

applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action

violating that norm. The judgment of the court of

A. For several decades, the Executive Branch has taken the view that federal courts have original jurisdiction over civil actions for torts committed in violation of the law of nations, without exempting torts committed by U.S. corporations
B. This Administration’s new claim that U.S. corporate liability is “a question for Congress” ignores that Congress has already decided that U.S. corporations may be held liable for supporting human trafficking, slavery, and forced labor
C. Consistent judicial precedent reinforces the longstanding statutory interpretation that U.S. corporations are not immune from civil liability under the ATS.
II. Rewriting The Statute To Add A Categorical Bar To U.S. Corporate Liability Would Undermine U.S. Foreign Policy
A. Categorically barring U.S. corporate liability under the ATS would undermine congressional and executive actions to promote U.S. corporate leadership on human rights and forced labor. 
B. Domestic corporate liability under the ATS comports with the U.S. government’s broad foreign policy goals of promoting good corporate behavior abroad by U.S. actors
C. There is no need for a categorical bar on ATS liability for domestic corporations because judicial tools of civil procedure can effectively eliminate frivolous claims.","CONCLUSION

The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility

","CONCLUSION 
In the end, the best protection for religious 
liberty is to vindicate the separation between church 
and state that the ministerial exception doctrine 
vindicates by recognizing separate spheres of 
competence:  a civil jurisdiction independent from 
the 
church 
and 
an 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction 
independent from the state in relation to religious 
matters.  By its nature, the ministerial exception 
doctrine is jurisdictional, not an affirmative defense.  
To assess the applicability of the doctrine in reaction 
to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no test can answer every 
question with fidelity to the First Amendment if that 
test is applied in a rigid and insensitive manner. The

The Assembly Clause Complements The Ministerial Exception And Further Supports Reversal In These Cases.
A. The Assembly Clause was originally understood to protect the rights of religious groups. 
1. Early Congressional debates show that the Assembly Clause was meant to protect groups’ rights to form and to meet without government interference. 
2. Throughout the Nineteenth Century, state court decisions relied on assembly rights to protect the rights of religious organizations to meet and to determine their own membership.
B. Modern First Amendment doctrine focuses on a right of “expressive association” that is narrower than the right of assembly.
 

1. The Court’s Assembly Clause jurisprudence was robust and distinct during the 1930s and 1940s.
2. The modern right of association is partially anchored in the Assembly Clause.
3. The Court’s decision in Roberts v. United States Jaycees formed a conceptual framework for the right of association distinct from the assembly right.
C. The Court should expressly recognize the Assembly Clause roots of the right of association in assessing the scope of the ministerial exception here. 
D. The Assembly Clause also prevents the state from interfering in Petitioners’ decisions regarding whom they empower to carry out their religious missions. 
 
II. 
Hosanna-Tabor And Other Supreme Court Decisions Establish That The Assembly Clause, Along With The Religion Clauses, Provides Support For A Robust Ministerial Exception.
III. Recognizing The Role Of The Assembly Clause Would Help Ensure Adequate Protection For The Rights Of Religious Groups.
A. Christian Legal Society v. Martinez 
illustrates the risks of assessing 
religious groups’ right of association 
claims without regard to the 
Assembly Clause.
B. Lower court decisions upholding 
prohibitions on worship in public 
spaces illustrate the risks of 
assessing religious groups’ First 
Amendment claims without regard to 
the Assembly Clause.","CONCLUSION 
For the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-
verse the judgments of the Ninth Circuit in both of the 
consolidated cases.",http://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/19/19-267/132555/20200210164500558_John%20D.%20Inazu%20Morrissey%20Amicus%20Brief%202-10-2020%20FINAL.pdf,TRUE,Reverse,5.0,jk4739

I. The Ministerial Exception Serves the Purpose 
of the Religion Clauses by Ensuring that the 
Federal Government Does Not Interfere with 
Individual Freedom of Religion
A. The Establishment Clause protects religious 
institutions from federal interference
B. The ministerial exception keeps government 
out of religious matters and should be applied 
broadly. 
II. Courts Must Defer to a Religious 
Organization’s Sincere Determination as to 
Who Qualifies as a “Minister.”

","CONCLUSION 
The ministerial exception implements the reli-
gious freedoms of the Establishment Clause – the 
freedom from government interference in the selec-
tion and retention of individuals who will convey the 
message of a religious organization or pursue its mis-
sion.  The court should defer to the good-faith deter-
mination of the religious organization as to who those 
individuals are within the organization.

It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments

ARGUMENT

I. Presidential electors are not officers of the federal government, but they do exercise “federal functions”.

II. The nature and scope of federal functions exercised by actors outside the federal government vary considerably.

III. Elector discretion is within the scope of elector authority, but the scope of authority of those exercising other federal functions varies with each function.

IV. The distinctions in scope of authority among different federal functions justify the Court distinguishing its presidential elector holding from other federal functions.

CONCLUSION","Conclusion 
 
The Court should carefully limit its holding to 
presidential electors, clarifying that the decision is 
not applicable to others performing federal functions.

A. The Federalist Papers and Other Contemporaneous Evidence Establish That the Framers Intended Each Elector to Exercise Independent Judgment.

II. Congress Has Consistently Recognized and Maintained Elector Independence.

A. The Twelfth Amendment Was Adopted to Prevent Strategic Partisan Voting Without Limiting Elector Independence.

Congress did not consider limiting elector independence as a response to concerns about the early elections.

ARGUMENT

I. No matter how this Court rules on the existence and scope of discretion presidential electors may exercise, States and political parties will need to revisit their systems of selecting and appointing electors.

II. Practical issues with the fair, efficient operation of the process should be understood against the backdrop of modern presidential election reality affecting the relationship between the popular vote and electoral votes.

III. States should consider a proposed ballot form that enhances each voter’s control over how each vote cast is counted toward the State’s popular vote and the State’s electoral votes.

CONCLUSION","CONCLUSION 
Although MEVC does not take a position on the 
questions presented, it respectfully urges the Court to 
provide ample guidance on crucial practical issues 
that will inevitably arise no matter what the Court 
rules in Baca and Chiafalo. That guidance is needed 
to help the States implement presidential election 
procedures that comply with Constitutional require-
ments, promote an enduring regularity in presidential 
elections, and accurately reflect the choices of all vot-
ers in our democratic republic.

ARGUMENT

I. THE STATES’ PLENARY APPOINTMENT POWER INCLUDES THE ABILITY TO PLACE EX ANTE CONDITIONS ON ELECTOR APPOINTMENTS.

A. A Legally Mandated Pledge To Follow The State’s Popular Vote Is A Condition Of An Elector’s Appointment.
B. Enforcing An Elector’s Pledge Is A Valid Exercise Of The State’s Appointment Authority.
II. STATE AND FEDERAL LAW ARE NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE UNBOUND ELECTORS.

A. Unbinding Electors Would Require States To Radically Rework Their Electoral Processes And Would Undermine Established Election Laws And Practices.
B. Current Federal Law Does Not Address Significant Opportunities For Corruption If Electors Are Unbound.
III. ANY RULING FOR THE ELECTORS SHOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL AFTER THE 2020 ELECTION.

A. The FTC Has Increasingly Sought Monetary Relief Under Section 13(b), Amplifying Its Effect on Businesses.
B. The FTC’s Failure to Provide Businesses with Fair Notice of Prohibited Conduct Before Seeking Monetary Sanctions Chills Commerce.

in a difficult and fast-changing pandemic, and with the 
Diocese, which sincerely believes in the importance 
of its mission and has taken measures to mitigate 
the risk of its services. While the AMA and MSSNY 
recognize that this case cannot be decided by science 
alone, they believe that the Court’s understanding of 
the science should be as accurate as possible. The 
science indicates that even with protective measures 
in place, attending a religious service is inherently 
risky, that its risk is comparable to that of activities 
prohibited in New York’s red and orange zones, and 
that this risk cannot be eliminated.

COVID-19 is a serious public health threat. It has already killed almost a

that extraordinary protective measures are warranted. In particular, the activities

Appellate Panels

B. A Court Rule (Written or Unwritten)

Requiring Geographic Quotas is Not

The devastation of the Bayou Corne sinkhole is 
apparent, and the resulting litigation up to this point 
has been staggering. While substantial in volume, the 
facts of this case are not overly complex. Considering 
the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that the 
Oxy entities, the Texas Brine entities, and Vulcan are 
each allocated a portion of responsibility for the 
damages occasioned by the Bayou Corne sinkhole 
under Civil Code Articles 2315 and 2317.1. 
Although all internal data from the OG3 cavern 
indicated current stability when Vulcan sold their 
interests to OxyChem, Vulcan’s negligence in failing 
to facilitate recommended studies to further define 
the edge of the Salt Dome before doubling production,

The district court committed an error at the very 
least in their commanded remedy. The district court 
was asked to prevent the President of the United 
States from using anything other than the total 
population of the United States to apportion 
congressional 
seats. 
The 
Congressional 
apportionment occurs at the second step of the 
census reporting statute, and the district court’s 
order did not properly assess the first step of the 
process.  
 
The district court improperly prevented the 
Secretary from even reporting information to the 
President at step one. Regardless of how this Court 
decides the merits of the case at step two, this Court 
should never prevent the Secretary of Commerce 
from reporting the number of U.S. citizens living in 
the United States and the number of those persons 
residing in the United States without authorization. 
This information is critically important, especially 
for legislatures as they embark on their sovereign 
function of drawing districts for the following 
decade.

C. In Section 2, Congress Sought to Deter and Remedy Constitutional Violations by Responding to the Lingering Impact or Present Danger Signs of Intentional Discrimination.

II. There Is No Reason for this Court to Overturn Precedent, Neutering Congressional Authority to Act Pursuant to an Enumerated Power.
 
III. This Case Is a Poor Vehicle to Assess the Scope of Section 2 or the Fifteenth Amendment. 

A. The Primary Question with Respect to the Ballot Collection Statute Is a Factual Matter Limited to this Case.

B. The Primary Question with Respect to Ballots Cast in an Incorrect Precinct Is Not Only a Factual Matter Limited to this Case, but Also of Limited Practical Significance in Arizona Going Forward.","CONCLUSION

B.  Petitioners’ Attempts to Limit Section 2’s Results Standard to Voter Qualifications Lacks any Textual or Historical Basis.

C. Neither the Widespread Use of a Practice, Nor the Theoretical Availability of Other Opportunities to Participate, is Sufficient to Defeat a Section 2 Claim, Which Requires a Localized, Fact-Specific Analysis.
 
II. THE COURT SHOULD ADOPT THE TEST FOR LIABILITY EMPLOYED            BY THE MAJORITY OF CIRCUITS TO HAVE CONSIDERED VOTE DENIAL/ ABRIDGMENT CLAIMS.

A. Prong One Limits Section 2 Liability by Requiring Plaintiffs to Establish a Material Burden on Voting that Falls More Heavily on Minority Voters, Not Mere Statistical Disparities.
 
B. Prong Two Limits Liability by Requiring Plaintiffs to Establish a Causal Relationship Between Disparate Results and Social and Historical Conditions.

1.  Prong 2 Requires that Plaintiffs Demonstrate the Disparity was Caused By or Linked to Historical and Social Conditions that Produce Current Discrimination.

2.  Prong 2 Acts as an Effective Limit on Section 2 Liability.","CONCLUSION

scotus_filing_46719,I.   H.B. 2023 Works as Designed to Suppress Voting in Minority Communities.,"CONCLUSION 
 
Like the poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim 
Crow era, modern voter suppression efforts are relent-
less and effective. H.B. 2023 is one such effort, adopted 
in Arizona based on demonstrably false claims of voter 
fraud for the specific purpose of stopping a practice 
used predominately in minority communities. See 
DNC, 948 F.3d at 1037 (“[I]f some Arizonans today dis-
trust third-party ballot collection, it is because of the 
fraudulent campaign mounted by proponents of H.B. 
2023. . . . To the degree that there has been any fraud, 
it has been the false and race-based claims of the pro-
ponents of H.B. 2023”). This Court should affirm the 
Ninth Circuit’s en banc opinion.

II.  The History of the Voting Rights Act Has  Been to Include and Protect Latino Voters. 
 
III. Courts Have Found Attacks on Latino Voters, and § 2 Has Protected These Voters.
 
IV. The Ninth Circuit Properly Analyzed Arizona’s Voting Policies and Correctly Concluded They Violate the Voting Rights Act.
 
A.  Arizona’s Challenged Policies Impose a Disparate Burden on Minority Voters. 
 
B.  The Disparate Burden on Minority Voters  Is Linked to Social and Historical Conditions in Arizona.
 
1.  Latino voters are more likely than white voters to lack access to knowledge of their polling place.
 
2.  Latino voters are more likely than white voters to lack access to their polling place or ballot drop-off locations.
