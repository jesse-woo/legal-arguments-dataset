## Human Labeled Data Cleaning + Analysis

### What it do
- [aggregate.py](aggregate.py): glob together csv files
- [analysis.py](analysis.py): check out distinct values
- [data-cleaning.py](data-cleaning.py): .tolower() and trim headers and write [to new file](annotated-dataset/human-annotated-data-standardized.csv) 


### TODOs
* Once human annotations are done, download all as csvs from google drive >> human-annotated-data/
* do basic analysis + cleaning based on input values, strip down csvs, deal with missing/badly formed values
* advanced analysis / compare to model parsing
