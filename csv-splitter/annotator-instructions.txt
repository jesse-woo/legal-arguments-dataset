Hello, and thank you for annotating for us!

Here are your instructions for annotating. Please follow them exactly, and precisely. 

1. Please go to [drive/data link]

2. Here, you should see a csv file in the format of [your-UNI].csv

3. Right-click on the file, and select "Open with" >> "Google Sheets". This should open
a Google sheet representation of the CSV file. 
- Do NOT modify any cells other than the ones you are explicitly instructed to annotate

4. Modify the column spacing to make the documents more readable. For example, you should
drag and expand the column width for columns B (table of contents) and D. 

5. Confirm that you see your UNI as the document title, as well as in the last column 
'annotator-uni'

For each row (2 - 20), do the following tasks: 

(0) Confirm that this the ToC has been extracted properly
- Write exactly one of [True, False]

(1) Extract the arguments and paste them in this form
- [Detailed Instruction]

(2) Classify the outcome of the brief. We will provide some examples for all of you. 
- Write exactly one of [Affirm, Reverse, Remand, Grant, Deny, Other]. Use 'Other'
if you are not sure, or if there is substantial amiguity. 
- [Detailed Instruction about outcomes]
- [Examples]

(3) Rate the salience of the reasoning behind the conclusion based on the table of contents
In other words, is the logic of the outcome clear from solely the table of contents?
- [Detailed Instruction] Use a scale of 1-5, where 1 is Not Clear At All, and 5 is 
Extremely Clear
