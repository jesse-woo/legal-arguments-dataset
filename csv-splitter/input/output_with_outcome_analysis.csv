In conclusion:
• 
The NCAA is not a sports league.
• 
The NCAA is not a production joint venture.
• 
Amateur college sports can exist without the 
NCAA.
• 
The NCAA facilitates a member conference 
cartel over college athletes.
The upshot of these conclusions is that the “joint 
venture” NCAA, designed and implemented by member 
conferences and independents, is a price fixing 
cartel over college athletes. The collusion of member 
conferences and independents to fix this input price is 
not necessary for member conferences and independents 
to fulfill their necessary function of creating conference 
and independent play. While most of the debate is about 
the fairness to athletes, economics adds that there 
are efficiency losses to this cartel behavior and that 
removing the cartel actually produces efficiency gains 
that the courts are not considering yet.
Amici urge the Court to add these conclusions from 
the economic analysis of sports and reject the erroneous 
“joint venture” plea by the NCAA.
It is in the interests of society that the full array of 
antitrust relief be considered in any joint venture activity 
arousing suspicion of anticompetitive behavior. The 
demands that no further rule of reason “burden” be put 
upon “the NCAA”, and that member conferences acting 
via their NCAA deserve even more antitrust leniency, are 
unsupported by economic findings."

ARGUMENT 
3 
The Court of Appeals correctly held 
that ANCs do not meet the definition of 
""Tribal governments"" eligible to receive 
Title V CARES Act funding, which is 
consistent with Title V's structure of 
funding sovereign entities and their 
political subdivisions 
3 
The Secretary's interpretation of the 
CARES Act results in double counting 
segments of Alaska's population, 
unfairly directing funds to the ANCs at 
the expense of federally recognized 
tribes

III.The State of Alaska may distribute its 
Title V CARES Act funding to ANCs to

Amici States and the recognized tribes within 
their borders are striving, through their CARES Act 
Title V funding allocation, to serve the needs of all 
their citizens and members. And they are doing so 
with an allocation of funds based upon their popula-
tions. The Secretary's interpretation of the CARES 
Act and ISDA is incorrect as a matter of statutory con-
struction, and it deprives the recognized tribes of the 
full amount of funds to which they are entitled to 
serve their members.

86. Stone Creek asserts claims for federal and com-
mon law trademark infringement and Lanham 
Act unfair competition. 
87. A trademark is any word, name, symbol, device, or 
any combination thereof, used by a person to iden-
tify and distinguish that person’s goods from those 
of others and to indicate the source of the goods, 
even if that source is generally unknown. 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1127. 
88. “A trademark is a limited property right in a par-
ticular word, phrase or symbol.” New Kids on the 
Block v. New Am. Pub., Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th 
Cir. 1992). It identifies the source of goods. 
Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Entm’t Corp., 
174 F.3d 1036, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). 
89. To prevail on its trademark infringement and un-
fair competition claims, Stone Creek must show: 
(1) it owns a valid mark; (2) the mark was used 
without its consent; and (3) such unauthorized use 
is likely to cause confusion among ordinary con-
sumers as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or 
approval of the goods. See Credit One Corp. v. 
Credit One Fin., Inc., 661 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137 
(C.D. Cal. 2009) (collecting cases and authorities)."

I. California’s ban on indoor worship cannot withstand strict scrutiny  
under Diocese of Brooklyn. ....................................................................................... 3 
A. California’s worship ban is “far more restrictive” than the  
numerical caps enjoined in Diocese of Brooklyn. ............................................... 4 
B. California’s worship ban is “much tighter” than the  
measures used by any other state. ..................................................................... 5 
C. California’s ban is “far more severe” than required to  
prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Applicants’ indoor  
worship services. ................................................................................................. 9 
D. California also cannot meet its burden on strict scrutiny  
because it withheld key facts from the lower courts. ...................................... 11

A. Where less restrictive means are available, the balance of  
harms tips towards Applicants. ........................................................................ 13

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

especially since it was passed in 2019 before the pandemic hit the United States."

I.
THE MANDATORY VACCINATION POLICY OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IS A VIOLATION OF AN
INDIVIDUAL’S FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT TO BODILY
INTEGRITY AND THE RIGHT TO REFUSE UNWANTED
MEDICAL TREATMENT . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4
A. Bodily integrity and the right to refuse
unwanted medical treatment is afforded the
highest protection and the vaccine mandate
that infringes on this right must pass strict
scrutiny, which this mandate does not, and,
therefore, the mandate violates student's
fundamental rights . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5

Amicus draws the attention of this Court to the 
crucial role of natural immunity in addressing not 
only Petitioners’ significant protected interests, but 
also those same interests of the public during this 
period of declared (but not currently scientifically 
validated) pandemic accompanied by untenable 
medical interventions. This Court ought to take 
notice, as well, that the President seeks to indirectly 
mandate EUA inoculations through employers, 
despite the settled jurisprudence that the States 
alone have such police power (if it exists), and the 
settled jurisprudence of this Court that all human 
beings have a right to informed consent and bodily 
integrity.  
Shall the most serious public health challenge in 
several generations be resolved by executive action 
and by private mandates under color of law without 
meaningful judicial review under the strict scrutiny 
standard? 
 Amicus respectfully requests that this Court 
grant the Petition for a Writ of Mandamus, or in the 
alternative, Certification, in the public interest and 
to protect the interests of the Petitioners and Amicus’ 
associates.  
Respectfully submitted,

I. 
To Assure that Older South 
Carolinians Can Vote Safely, the 
State Must Limit High-Risk, 
Interpersonal Contact in the 
November Election ........................................... 10 
 
A. For Medically Vulnerable 
Older Voters, Risk of COVID-
19 Infection for the General 
Election Would Be 
Unacceptably High If the 
Witness Requirement Is 
Enforced and, Thus, Absentee 
Voting Requires Close Contact 
with Persons Whose 
Compliance with Anti-Virus 
Measures Is Unknown................................ 10 
ii 
 
 
B. Risks of Serious Harm, 
Including Death, Due to 
COVID-19 Are Especially 
High for Older South 
Carolinians .................................................. 14 
 
C. The COVID-19 Crisis—and 
Dangers Related to 
Enforcement of the Witness 
Requirement—Will Still Be 
Present in November .................................. 20 
 
D. Enforcing the Witness 
Requirement Would Be 
Especially Perverse Given the 
Higher Levels of Electoral 
Participation of Older Voters 
Who Are Most at Risk from 
COVID-19 .................................................... 22 
 
II. 
The Witness Requirement as 
Applied to the November General 
Election in South Carolina 
Violates the U.S. Constitution by 
Creating an Undue Risk of 
Serious Injury or Death for 
Medically Vulnerable Voters, 
Most of Whom Are Older ................................. 25

The AMA and MSSNY sympathize with the Gover-
nor, who must balance public health with civil liberties 
in a difficult and fast-changing pandemic, and with the 
Diocese, which sincerely believes in the importance 
of its mission and has taken measures to mitigate 
the risk of its services. While the AMA and MSSNY 
recognize that this case cannot be decided by science 
alone, they believe that the Court’s understanding of 
the science should be as accurate as possible. The 
science indicates that even with protective measures 
in place, attending a religious service is inherently 
risky, that its risk is comparable to that of activities 
prohibited in New York’s red and orange zones, and 
that this risk cannot be eliminated.

If there is one belief widely held among the diverse faiths that Americans hold, 
it is the great value that they place on human life. E.g., Deuteronomy 30:19–20. The 
precious right to worship freely should not be misapplied in a manner that 
contributes to the spread of disease, suffering, and death. For to do so would defeat 
the very purpose of that right: “The dead cannot praise the Lord.” Psalms 115:17. 
New York has carefully drawn distinctions based on objective public-health-
based considerations, while at the same time showing special solicitude—not 
disfavor—for religious institutions and their worship service"

COVID-19 is a serious public health threat. It has already killed almost a 
quarter of a million Americans. There is a consensus among public health experts 
that extraordinary protective measures are warranted. In particular, the activities 
that pose the highest risk of transmission—large indoor gatherings in which people 
spend long periods of time together in poorly ventilated spaces—must be restricted. 
We believe California’s data-driven response is supported by epidemiology and is wise 
(indeed, necessary) to slow the spread of this dangerous virus."

ented schools, may be necessary public health measures.

Court of the United States and Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit

Movants Senator Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola, members of the 
Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Caucus, respectfully seek leave to file the 
accompanying brief as amici curiae in opposition to the emergency Application for 
Writ of Injunction Pending the filing and Disposition of a Petition for a Writ of 
Certiorari filed in the above-captioned matter. 
 
Amici curiae Senators Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola submit this 
motion and accompanying brief.  Senators Costa and Boscola submit that members 
iii 
of the General Assembly voted in support of and in opposition to the legislation 
that was ultimately enacted as Act 77.1  Senators Costa and Boscola seek to present 
herein and in the accompanying brief a unique perspective concerning the actions 
of the General Assembly in the enactment of Act 77 and the requirement that the 
enactment be granted the customary broad presumption of constitutionality 
concerning both the procedures used in its enactment as well as the 
constitutionality of the act itself.   Pursuant to its broad grant of plenary legislative 
authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the General Assembly acted in 
compliance with state constitutional provisions concerning the enactment of Act 77 
that included, inter alia, expanded voting opportunities through the use of “mail-in 
ballots.” 
 
Amici curiae also requests permission to file its proposed brief on 8 ½ inch 
by 11 inch paper pursuant to Rule 33.2.  Applicants’ emergency petition seeks the 
Court’s immediate intervention and time does not allow for the printing of booklets 
under rule 33.1.  Accordingly, amici respectfully move this Court to accept the 
filing of its amicus brief using the format specified in Rule 33.2. 
 
1 The legislation that was eventually enacted as Act 77 of 2019 was introduced as Senate 
Bill 421 in the 2019-2020 legislative session by Sen. Lisa Boscola.  The legislation, amended in 
the House of Representatives to include Mail-In Ballots was approved by bipartisan votes of 138 
to 61 in the House and 35 to 14 in the Senate.  The Governor signed the bill into law as Act 77 
on October 31, 2019.  See Pa. Act of Oct. 31, 2019, No. 77, P.L. 552, Cl. 25, S.B. 421. 
 
iv 
 
For these reasons, amici curiae respectfully request the Court’s leave to file 
the attached amicus curiae brief containing 1,562 words, and for leave to file the 
brief pursuant to Rule 33.2.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

Amici simply observe that the COVID-19 pandemic does not justify an unconstitutional statute, 
especially since it was passed in 2019 before the pandemic hit the United States."

ARGUMENT .................................................................................................................. 3 
I. California’s ban on indoor worship cannot withstand strict scrutiny  
under Diocese of Brooklyn. ....................................................................................... 3 
A. California’s worship ban is “far more restrictive” than the  
numerical caps enjoined in Diocese of Brooklyn. ............................................... 4 
B. California’s worship ban is “much tighter” than the  
measures used by any other state. ..................................................................... 5 
C. California’s ban is “far more severe” than required to  
prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Applicants’ indoor  
worship services. ................................................................................................. 9 
D. California also cannot meet its burden on strict scrutiny  
because it withheld key facts from the lower courts. ...................................... 11 
II. Injunctive relief is warranted. ............................................................................... 13 
A. Where less restrictive means are available, the balance of  
harms tips towards Applicants. ........................................................................ 13 
B. The Court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable  
remedy that enjoins the ban on indoor worship while  
allowing percentage-of-occupancy limits like those California  
now employs in four counties. .......................................................................... 14

4 The fact that Dr. Chen’s simulated maps were allowed into evidence at all will be a crucial 
issue on appeal. The evidentiary issues surrounding Dr. Chen’s simulations are legion. See Mot. In 
Limine to Exclude Expert Report of Dr. Chen (ECF No. 147). Among other things, Dr. Chen deleted 
his source code which deprived Defendants’ experts from assessing, inter alia, the reliability of the 
simulations. See id.; see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1995). 
Dr. Chen also failed to program Michigan’s proper redistricting criteria. See Mot. In Limine to Exclude

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance."

After this Court’s decision in CLS, “the right of 
association bore little resemblance to the right of 
assembly that had existed for almost two hundred 
years of our nation’s history.”87  In deciding these 
cases, this Court should return to the text of the First 
Amendment and reconfirm its earlier precedent that 
the right of assembly stands on a co-equal footing with 
other First Amendment freedoms.

California 
Constitution is unequivocal: 
All people are by nature free and independent and have 
inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and 
defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and 
protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, 
happiness, and privacy. 
Cal. Const. art. I, § 1 (emphasis added).  If its legislature cannot 
intrude upon these constitutional rights, a fortiori, a lone 
member of the executive branch lacks such power."

This Court has held that compelled disclosure can 
violate associational rights guaranteed under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To 
protect these rights, this Court has developed a test 
that it described as strict. The lower courts, however, 
and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
here, have applied a diluted version of this Court’s 
test, permitting compelled disclosure in nearly all 
circumstances. To respect the Framers’ defense of 
speaking without disclosing the identity of the 
speaker, to restore the Framers’ view of compelled 
disclosure with “just Alarm,” to provide clarity and 
predictability to states, courts, and speakers, and 
because compelled disclosure has recently caused 
harm to First Amendment associational rights, this 
Court should, as Petitioners urge, apply strict 
scrutiny.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision seriously undermines

donors are exposed to significant doxxing risks, this

A. The challenged reporting requirement  
is not a public disclosure law ........................... 5 
B. Even if the possibility of public disclosure

Schedule B reporting is minimal and any 
First Amendment harm remains “highly 
speculative.” ..................................................... 8 
C. There is no evidence of significant donor 
attrition or “chill.” .......................................... 10 
D. Requiring charities to confidentially  
report their major donors to state tax  
authorities does not categorically impose 
“severe burdens on free association.” ............ 13

MINIMAL, SO STRICT SCRUTINY REVIEW—OR 
ITS EQUIVALENT—IS NOT WARRANTED ................ 15

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance."

Because religious liberty is the first and foremost 
of 
our 
God-given 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution, it is entirely appropriate that this 
Court invoke the First Amendment to establish that 
church employment matters are exempt from 
government control.  By so doing, the Court can 
extricate itself from the quagmire of having to 
perpetually examine church doctrine, tradition, and 
polity to determine who is and is not a minister for 
purposes of a ministerial exception. 
 
If the Court is not willing to take that step, the 
Foundation urges the Court to defer to the 
determinations of church authorities that their 
employees are ministers absent compelling reasons to 
the contrary.

The Ninth Circuit’s approach in Biel and 
Morrissey-Berru is inconsistent with this Court’s 
decision in Hosanna-Tabor and the intent of the 
Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. This Court 
should reject that faulty approach and endorse that 
followed by the other circuits, which considers the 
function performed by the religious organization’s 
employee and whether that function is religiously 
important. To avoid impermissible interference in 
religious affairs, and to mitigate potential harm to 
minority religions, this Court should instruct courts to 
defer to the religious organization’s sincerely held 
belief regarding the importance of the religious 
function."

In the end, the best protection for religious 
liberty is to vindicate the separation between church 
and state that the ministerial exception doctrine 
vindicates by recognizing separate spheres of 
competence:  a civil jurisdiction independent from 
the 
church 
and 
an 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction 
independent from the state in relation to religious 
matters.  By its nature, the ministerial exception 
doctrine is jurisdictional, not an affirmative defense.  
To assess the applicability of the doctrine in reaction 
to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no test can answer every 
question with fidelity to the First Amendment if that 
test is applied in a rigid and insensitive manner. The 
nature of the dispute must always be considered; 
regardless of the employee’s duties.  A religious 
organization may have a religious basis for the 
termination of employment that is protected by the 
First Amendment.  Whatever test they employ, the 
lower courts should be instructed to tread with 
caution 
and 
to 
consider 
carefully 
whether 
adjudicating the issues raised by the particular 
dispute will entangle the court in matters of faith.    
The Court can come closer to the ideal with a more 
sensitive, flexible and principled test."

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..................................... 3 
ARGUMENT ............................................................... 5 
I. 
The Assembly Clause Complements The 
Ministerial Exception And Further 
Supports Reversal In These Cases. .................... 5 
A. The Assembly Clause was originally 
understood to protect the rights of 
religious groups. ........................................... 5 
1. Early Congressional debates show 
that the Assembly Clause was meant 
to protect groups’ rights to form and 
to meet without government 
interference. .............................................6 
2. Throughout the Nineteenth Century, 
state court decisions relied on 
assembly rights to protect the rights 
of religious organizations to meet 
and to determine their own 
membership. ............................................9 
B. Modern First Amendment doctrine 
focuses on a right of “expressive 
association” that is narrower than 
the right of assembly. ................................. 12 
 
 
 
iv 
1. The Court’s Assembly Clause 
jurisprudence was robust and 
distinct during the 1930s and 1940s. .... 13 
2. The modern right of association is 
partially anchored in the Assembly 
Clause. .................................................... 15 
3. The Court’s decision in Roberts v. 
United States Jaycees formed a 
conceptual framework for the right 
of association distinct from the 
assembly right. ...................................... 17 
C. The Court should expressly recognize 
the Assembly Clause roots of the 
right of association in assessing the 
scope of the ministerial exception 
here. ............................................................ 21 
D. The Assembly Clause also prevents 
the state from interfering in 
Petitioners’ decisions regarding 
whom they empower to carry out 
their religious missions. ............................. 23 
 
 
 
v 
II. 
Hosanna-Tabor And Other Supreme Court 
Decisions Establish That The Assembly 
Clause, Along With The Religion Clauses, 
Provides Support For A Robust Ministerial 
Exception. .......................................................... 25 
III. Recognizing The Role Of The Assembly 
Clause Would Help Ensure Adequate 
Protection For The Rights Of Religious 
Groups. ............................................................... 30 
A. Christian Legal Society v. Martinez 
illustrates the risks of assessing 
religious groups’ right of association 
claims without regard to the 
Assembly Clause. ....................................... 30 
B. Lower court decisions upholding 
prohibitions on worship in public 
spaces illustrate the risks of 
assessing religious groups’ First 
Amendment claims without regard to 
the Assembly Clause. ................................. 32

The ministerial exception implements the reli-
gious freedoms of the Establishment Clause – the 
freedom from government interference in the selec-
tion and retention of individuals who will convey the 
message of a religious organization or pursue its mis-
sion.  The court should defer to the good-faith deter-
mination of the religious organization as to who those 
individuals are within the organization.

The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-
tomary international law prohibition against slavery 
applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action 
under the ATS against domestic corporations for  
violating that norm. The judgment of the court of  
appeals should be affirmed.

ARGUMENT ................................................................ 6 
I. This Administration’s Radical Departure 
From The Longstanding Executive Branch 
Reading Of The ATS Flouts The Settled 
Understanding Of All Three Branches Of 
The Federal Government. ..................................... 6 
A.  For several decades, the Executive 
Branch has taken the view that federal 
courts have original jurisdiction over 
civil actions for torts committed in 
violation of the law of nations, without 
exempting torts committed by U.S. 
corporations. ..................................................... 7 
B. This Administration’s new claim that 
U.S. corporate liability is “a question for 
Congress” ignores that Congress has 
already decided that U.S. corporations 
may be held liable for supporting 
human trafficking, slavery, and forced 
labor. ............................................................... 11 
C. Consistent judicial precedent reinforces 
the longstanding statutory 
interpretation that U.S. corporations 
are not immune from civil liability 
under the ATS. ............................................... 15 
ii 
 
II. Rewriting The Statute To Add A 
Categorical Bar To U.S. Corporate Liability 
Would Undermine U.S. Foreign Policy. .............. 16 
A. Categorically barring U.S. corporate 
liability under the ATS would 
undermine congressional and executive 
actions to promote U.S. corporate 
leadership on human rights and forced 
labor. ............................................................... 18 
B. Domestic corporate liability under the 
ATS comports with the U.S. 
government’s broad foreign policy goals 
of promoting good corporate behavior 
abroad by U.S. actors. .................................... 23 
C. There is no need for a categorical bar on 
ATS liability for domestic corporations 
because judicial tools of civil procedure 
can effectively eliminate frivolous 
claims. ............................................................. 27

United States courts are an appropriate forum to 
hear claims that United States citizens, whether 
individuals or corporations, have aided and abetted 
child slavery. Such conduct is no less horrendous and 
no less deserving of redress when the enslaved 
children are forced to labor outside our shores. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted. 
 
6 Not surprisingly given the TVPRA’s textual clarity on this 
matter, lower courts have routinely heard civil actions against 
corporate defendants under the TVPRA. Indeed, 66% of the 
lawsuits trafficking victims have filed under the TVPRA have 
named corporate or organizational defendants. See Alexander F. 
Levy, Federal Human Trafficking Civil Litigation: 15 Years of 
the Private Right of Action, Human Trafficking Legal Center 18

The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility

reality is that when the government intrudes on deeply sensitive 
religious beliefs through a mandate that admits of exceptions 
(both religious and non-religious), the way to eliminate the 
burden is to extend the exemption.”)."

ARGUMENT ............................................................... 3 
I. Nationwide Injunctions Exceed the Power of 
the District and Circuit Courts ........................ 3 
A. The judicial power extends only to cases 
and controversies, and that limitation 
precludes an award of relief to parties 
who are not before the court. ..................... 3

A federal court may only exercise judicial power 
consistent with the grant of power contained in the 
Constitution.  This means that remedies are limited 
to the parties before the court.  Once the plaintiff has 
a remedy, it no longer had authority to bring a case. 
Beyond the question of the injunction, there is no 
showing that Congress ever intended to enact a con-
traceptive mandate.  Therefore, the question of 
whether Congress intended there to be a conscience 
exemption from that mandate simply asks the wrong 
question.  This Court should reverse the judgment of 
the court below and dissolve the injunction.

ARGUMENT .............................................................. 6 
I. 
The 2017 Rules Were Procedurally 
Invalid. ............................................................. 6 
A. 
The agencies did not have good 
cause to forego notice and 
comment. ............................................... 8 
B. 
The agencies did not have 
statutory authorization to issue 
the 2017 Rules without notice 
and comment. ...................................... 12 
II. 
The Procedural Errors Infecting the 
2017 Rules Render the Essentially 
Identical 2018 Rules Similarly Invalid. ........ 15 
A. 
An agency that deviates from the 
APA’s prescribed procedures by 
frontloading rulemaking and 
tacking on comment as an 
afterthought has not given the 
public a meaningful “opportunity 
to participate in the rule 
making.” .............................................. 15 
 
 
 
ii 
 
 
B. 
An agency that violates section 
553 must establish it maintained 
an “open mind” when considering 
post-promulgation comments or 
have its rule vacated, irrespective 
of whether the agency swiftly re-
promulgates the same rule. ................ 20

Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.

ARGUMENT ............................................................... 4 
I. 
No matter how this Court rules on the 
existence and scope of discretion 
presidential electors may exercise, States 
and political parties will need to revisit 
their systems of selecting and appointing 
electors. ................................................................ 4 
II. 
Practical issues with the fair, efficient 
operation of the process should be 
understood against the backdrop of 
modern presidential election reality 
affecting the relationship between the 
popular vote and electoral votes. ......................... 9 
III. States should consider a proposed ballot 
form that enhances each voter’s control 
over how each vote cast is counted toward 
the State’s popular vote and the State’s 
electoral votes. ................................................... 12

Although MEVC does not take a position on the 
questions presented, it respectfully urges the Court to 
provide ample guidance on crucial practical issues 
that will inevitably arise no matter what the Court 
rules in Baca and Chiafalo. That guidance is needed 
to help the States implement presidential election 
procedures that comply with Constitutional require-
ments, promote an enduring regularity in presidential 
elections, and accurately reflect the choices of all vot-
ers in our democratic republic.

It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments
of the Second and D.C. Circuits and order entry of the
injunctions the President requests."

For its 230 year history, this Court has heeded 
Judge Montesquieu’s warning about legislative 
overreach working attainder. When any legislative 
body has defaming, punishment power, “the life and 
liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary 
control.”41  
Now, once again, this Court has opportunity and 
duty to take-up Colonel Alexander Hamilton’s cause 
to insure that defamatory attainder processes will 
not be allowed in America.

THE PRACTICE OF AVOIDING CONFLICTS

PRESIDENT’S PERSONAL FINANCES IS 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD

Throughout the Nation’s history, various 
presidents have placed restraints on their 
personal financial interests to avoid 
conflicts of

DIVESTMENT DECISIONS DEPART FROM 
MODERN PRACTICE, RENDERING 
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ESSENTIAL. …17

A. 
President Trump’s failure to divest or 
create blind trusts departs from 
presidential norms imposed by ethics-

A. Congress has a long, bipartisan history of 
issuing subpoenas for presidential records as

its legislative functions. ........................................ 10

congressional subpoenas absent a 
particularized claim of privilege. ......................... 15

B. Key provisions of the ACA abolished

1. The ACA ended gender rating. ............. 12 
2. The ACA prohibited denials, 
exclusions, and increased premiums 
based on pre-existing conditions 
disproportionately impacting 
women and girls. ................................... 14 
3. The ACA improved coverage for 
women’s health needs. ........................... 18 
4. The ACA expanded medicaid and

There is no evidence that Congress, in lowering the 
tax associated with the individual-responsibility pro-

Over the course of a decade, the ACA has 
fundamentally reshaped the nation’s health care 
system.  Congress in 2017 chose not to disturb that 
paradigm shift—including the promise of affordable 
coverage for those with preexisting conditions—when 
defanging the individual mandate without repealing 
any other part of the ACA.

The ACA is a landmark law that has 
transformed the lives of millions of Americans. Among 
its many benefits, the ACA increases access to health 
care for tens of millions of people, protects consumers 
against 
discrimination 
based 
on 
preexisting 
conditions and age, increases the financial stability of 
the Medicare program, and protects older adults from 
abuse and neglect. And, as the pandemic has shown, 
the law is a stabilizing force that helps steady the 
country in times of crisis. 
 
Ten years in, the ACA is woven into the fabric 
of our economy and our lives. A decision invalidating 
the law would be a nationwide catastrophe for the 
health and financial stability of all Americans, but 
especially for older adults. It would also be unjust, as 
the minimum coverage provision is constitutional.  
Even if the Court finds that the minimum coverage 
provision is unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA 
should stand. Many provisions, such as those providing 
cost-savings to Medicare beneficiaries, are wholly 
unrelated to the mandate. Most importantly, Congress 
did, in fact, leave the rest of the law standing, and the 
ACA continues to operate as Congress intended.   
 
Simply put, the ACA is benefitting millions of 
people, the health care system, and the national 
economy and should remain in force."

stated the First Amendment Burdens Pre-
sented by the Loan-Repayment Limit ........

District Court Failed to Credit ....................  11

THE NINTH CIRCUIT ERRED BECAUSE ITS

a. The VRA’s Passage Came After 
Decades of States Implementing 
Facially 
Race-Neutral 
Election 
Laws That Interacted with the 
Socio-Economic Conditions of Black 
People to Deny Their Right to Vote. .... 10 
b. Section 2’s Broad Proscription of 
Discriminatory Voting Laws Has 
Become More Necessary Since This 
Court’s Decision in Shelby County....... 11 
II. Section 2’s Text, History, and Purpose

Like the poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim 
Crow era, modern voter suppression efforts are relent-
less and effective. H.B. 2023 is one such effort, adopted 
in Arizona based on demonstrably false claims of voter 
fraud for the specific purpose of stopping a practice 
used predominately in minority communities. See 
DNC, 948 F.3d at 1037 (“[I]f some Arizonans today dis-
trust third-party ballot collection, it is because of the 
fraudulent campaign mounted by proponents of H.B. 
2023. . . . To the degree that there has been any fraud, 
it has been the false and race-based claims of the pro-
ponents of H.B. 2023”). This Court should affirm the 
Ninth Circuit’s en banc opinion.

The devastation of the Bayou Corne sinkhole is 
apparent, and the resulting litigation up to this point 
has been staggering. While substantial in volume, the 
facts of this case are not overly complex. Considering 
the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that the 
Oxy entities, the Texas Brine entities, and Vulcan are 
each allocated a portion of responsibility for the 
damages occasioned by the Bayou Corne sinkhole 
under Civil Code Articles 2315 and 2317.1. 
Although all internal data from the OG3 cavern 
indicated current stability when Vulcan sold their 
interests to OxyChem, Vulcan’s negligence in failing 
to facilitate recommended studies to further define 
the edge of the Salt Dome before doubling production, 
which moved the cavern closer to the edge"

The district court committed an error at the very 
least in their commanded remedy. The district court 
was asked to prevent the President of the United 
States from using anything other than the total 
population of the United States to apportion 
congressional 
seats. 
The 
Congressional 
apportionment occurs at the second step of the 
census reporting statute, and the district court’s 
order did not properly assess the first step of the 
process.  
 
The district court improperly prevented the 
Secretary from even reporting information to the 
President at step one. Regardless of how this Court 
decides the merits of the case at step two, this Court 
should never prevent the Secretary of Commerce 
from reporting the number of U.S. citizens living in 
the United States and the number of those persons 
residing in the United States without authorization. 
This information is critically important, especially 
for legislatures as they embark on their sovereign 
function of drawing districts for the following 
decade.
