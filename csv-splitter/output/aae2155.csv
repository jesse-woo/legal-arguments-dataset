MOTION FOR LEAVE TO FILE AMICUS BRIEF AND FOR

 To the Honorable Samuel A. Alito, Jr., Associate Justice of the Supreme  
Court of the United States and Circuit Justice for the Third Circuit

Movants Senator Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola, members of the 
Pennsylvania Senate Democratic Caucus, respectfully seek leave to file the 
accompanying brief as amici curiae in opposition to the emergency Application for 
Writ of Injunction Pending the filing and Disposition of a Petition for a Writ of 
Certiorari filed in the above-captioned matter. 
 
Amici curiae Senators Jay Costa and Senator Lisa M. Boscola submit this 
motion and accompanying brief.  Senators Costa and Boscola submit that members 
iii 
of the General Assembly voted in support of and in opposition to the legislation 
that was ultimately enacted as Act 77.1  Senators Costa and Boscola seek to present 
herein and in the accompanying brief a unique perspective concerning the actions 
of the General Assembly in the enactment of Act 77 and the requirement that the 
enactment be granted the customary broad presumption of constitutionality 
concerning both the procedures used in its enactment as well as the 
constitutionality of the act itself.   Pursuant to its broad grant of plenary legislative 
authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the General Assembly acted in 
compliance with state constitutional provisions concerning the enactment of Act 77 
that included, inter alia, expanded voting opportunities through the use of “mail-in 
ballots.” 
 
Amici curiae also requests permission to file its proposed brief on 8 ½ inch 
by 11 inch paper pursuant to Rule 33.2.  Applicants’ emergency petition seeks the 
Court’s immediate intervention and time does not allow for the printing of booklets 
under rule 33.1.  Accordingly, amici respectfully move this Court to accept the 
filing of its amicus brief using the format specified in Rule 33.2. 
 
1 The legislation that was eventually enacted as Act 77 of 2019 was introduced as Senate 
Bill 421 in the 2019-2020 legislative session by Sen. Lisa Boscola.  The legislation, amended in 
the House of Representatives to include Mail-In Ballots was approved by bipartisan votes of 138 
to 61 in the House and 35 to 14 in the Senate.  The Governor signed the bill into law as Act 77 
on October 31, 2019.  See Pa. Act of Oct. 31, 2019, No. 77, P.L. 552, Cl. 25, S.B. 421. 
 
iv 
 
For these reasons, amici curiae respectfully request the Court’s leave to file 
the attached amicus curiae brief containing 1,562 words, and for leave to file the 
brief pursuant to Rule 33.2.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

ARGUMENT .................................................................................................................. 3 
I. California’s ban on indoor worship cannot withstand strict scrutiny  
under Diocese of Brooklyn. ....................................................................................... 3 
A. California’s worship ban is “far more restrictive” than the  
numerical caps enjoined in Diocese of Brooklyn. ............................................... 4 
B. California’s worship ban is “much tighter” than the  
measures used by any other state. ..................................................................... 5 
C. California’s ban is “far more severe” than required to  
prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Applicants’ indoor  
worship services. ................................................................................................. 9 
D. California also cannot meet its burden on strict scrutiny  
because it withheld key facts from the lower courts. ...................................... 11 
II. Injunctive relief is warranted. ............................................................................... 13 
A. Where less restrictive means are available, the balance of  
harms tips towards Applicants. ........................................................................ 13 
B. The Court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable  
remedy that enjoins the ban on indoor worship while  
allowing percentage-of-occupancy limits like those California  
now employs in four counties. .......................................................................... 14

For the reasons set forth in this Reply, Applicants’ Emergency Motion, and Senate 
Intervenors’ Emergency Motion, Applicants respectfully request that this Court grant the requested

4 The fact that Dr. Chen’s simulated maps were allowed into evidence at all will be a crucial 
issue on appeal. The evidentiary issues surrounding Dr. Chen’s simulations are legion. See Mot. In 
Limine to Exclude Expert Report of Dr. Chen (ECF No. 147). Among other things, Dr. Chen deleted 
his source code which deprived Defendants’ experts from assessing, inter alia, the reliability of the 
simulations. See id.; see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1995). 
Dr. Chen also failed to program Michigan’s proper redistricting criteria. See Mot. In Limine to Exclude 
Expert Report of Dr. Chen at 16-18 (ECF No. 147).",,,,aae2155

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",,,,aae2155

After this Court’s decision in CLS, “the right of 
association bore little resemblance to the right of 
assembly that had existed for almost two hundred 
years of our nation’s history.”87  In deciding these 
cases, this Court should return to the text of the First 
Amendment and reconfirm its earlier precedent that 
the right of assembly stands on a co-equal footing with 
other First Amendment freedoms.
