The AMA and MSSNY sympathize with the Gover-

in a difficult and fast-changing pandemic, and with the 
Diocese, which sincerely believes in the importance 
of its mission and has taken measures to mitigate 
the risk of its services. While the AMA and MSSNY 
recognize that this case cannot be decided by science 
alone, they believe that the Court’s understanding of 
the science should be as accurate as possible. The 
science indicates that even with protective measures 
in place, attending a religious service is inherently 
risky, that its risk is comparable to that of activities 
prohibited in New York’s red and orange zones, and 
that this risk cannot be eliminated.

If there is one belief widely held among the diverse faiths that Americans hold, 
it is the great value that they place on human life. E.g., Deuteronomy 30:19–20. The 
precious right to worship freely should not be misapplied in a manner that 
contributes to the spread of disease, suffering, and death. For to do so would defeat 
the very purpose of that right: “The dead cannot praise the Lord.” Psalms 115:17. 
New York has carefully drawn distinctions based on objective public-health-
based considerations, while at the same time showing special solicitude—not 
disfavor—for religious institutions and their worship service",,,,aae2155

Only a year ago, the thought of state governments cracking down on public 
worship was unthinkable.  It has sadly now become commonplace.  But this Court 
should not allow it to become acceptable.  To be clear, amici appreciate the challenges 
state and local elected and public health officials face in combating this pandemic.  At 
the same time, the simple truth remains that when a situation is so bad as to justify 
such extreme restrictions, then such restrictions should rightly apply equally to all 
similarly situated assemblies as a matter of sound policy and logic.  The fact that the

COVID-19 is a serious public health threat. It has already killed almost a 
quarter of a million Americans. There is a consensus among public health experts 
that extraordinary protective measures are warranted. In particular, the activities 
that pose the highest risk of transmission—large indoor gatherings in which people 
spend long periods of time together in poorly ventilated spaces—must be restricted. 
We believe California’s data-driven response is supported by epidemiology and is wise 
(indeed, necessary) to slow the spread of this dangerous virus.",,,,aae2155

The AMA and MSNJ sympathize with the Respond-
ents, who must balance public health with civil 
liberties in a difficult and fast-changing pandemic, and 
with the Applicants, who sincerely believe in the 
importance of their mission. While the AMA and 
MSNJ recognize that this case cannot be decided by 
science alone, they believe that the Court’s under-
standing of the science should be as accurate as 
possible. The science indicates that even with pro-
tective measures in place, attending a religious service 
is inherently risky, that its risk is comparable to that 
of secular activities subject to the same limitations, 
and that this risk cannot be eliminated. Moreover, 
granting discretion over mask use would allow 
religious services to become incomparably risky.

While Amici recognize that the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic can-
not be decided by science alone, they believe that the Court’s understanding of the 
science should be as accurate as possible. The science indicates that under certain 
circumstances, such as those described in Dr. Stack’s declaration, temporary school 
closures in grades K-12 for in-person learning, including closure of religiously ori-
ented schools, may be necessary public health measures.

of the General Assembly voted in support of and in opposition to the legislation 
that was ultimately enacted as Act 77.1  Senators Costa and Boscola seek to present 
herein and in the accompanying brief a unique perspective concerning the actions 
of the General Assembly in the enactment of Act 77 and the requirement that the 
enactment be granted the customary broad presumption of constitutionality 
concerning both the procedures used in its enactment as well as the 
constitutionality of the act itself.   Pursuant to its broad grant of plenary legislative 
authority under the Pennsylvania Constitution, the General Assembly acted in 
compliance with state constitutional provisions concerning the enactment of Act 77 
that included, inter alia, expanded voting opportunities through the use of “mail-in 
ballots.” 
 
Amici curiae also requests permission to file its proposed brief on 8 ½ inch 
by 11 inch paper pursuant to Rule 33.2.  Applicants’ emergency petition seeks the 
Court’s immediate intervention and time does not allow for the printing of booklets 
under rule 33.1.  Accordingly, amici respectfully move this Court to accept the 
filing of its amicus brief using the format specified in Rule 33.2. 
 
1 The legislation that was eventually enacted as Act 77 of 2019 was introduced as Senate 
Bill 421 in the 2019-2020 legislative session by Sen. Lisa Boscola.  The legislation, amended in 
the House of Representatives to include Mail-In Ballots was approved by bipartisan votes of 138 
to 61 in the House and 35 to 14 in the Senate.  The Governor signed the bill into law as Act 77 
on October 31, 2019.  See Pa. Act of Oct. 31, 2019, No. 77, P.L. 552, Cl. 25, S.B. 421. 
 
iv 
 
For these reasons, amici curiae respectfully request the Court’s leave to file 
the attached amicus curiae brief containing 1,562 words, and for leave to file the 
brief pursuant to Rule 33.2.

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated the Supremacy Clause when it 
elevated a state-law time bar over the Constitution of the United States. It also 
refused to acknowledge that the Constitution itself and a federal statute dictate the 
date on which the Presidential election must occur. Consequently, in addition to the 
reasons raised by the Applicants themselves, the judgment of the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court is due to be reversed.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ....................................................................................... 2 
ARGUMENT .................................................................................................................. 3 
I. California’s ban on indoor worship cannot withstand strict scrutiny  
under Diocese of Brooklyn. ....................................................................................... 3 
A. California’s worship ban is “far more restrictive” than the  
numerical caps enjoined in Diocese of Brooklyn. ............................................... 4 
B. California’s worship ban is “much tighter” than the  
measures used by any other state. ..................................................................... 5 
C. California’s ban is “far more severe” than required to  
prevent the spread of COVID-19 at Applicants’ indoor  
worship services. ................................................................................................. 9 
D. California also cannot meet its burden on strict scrutiny  
because it withheld key facts from the lower courts. ...................................... 11 
II. Injunctive relief is warranted. ............................................................................... 13 
A. Where less restrictive means are available, the balance of  
harms tips towards Applicants. ........................................................................ 13 
B. The Court has broad discretion to fashion an equitable  
remedy that enjoins the ban on indoor worship while  
allowing percentage-of-occupancy limits like those California  
now employs in four counties. .......................................................................... 14
