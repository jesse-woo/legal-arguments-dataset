I.   The rulings below override ongoing public 
debate about whether and how college 
athletes should receive compensation .......

A.   Student-athlete compensation is the 
subject of ongoing action by Congress, 
state legislatures, and the NCAA ........  
5 
B.   The decisions below will stand in the 
way of comprehensive reform ..............  10 
 II.   The injunction here threatens serious harm 
to collegiate sports in the amici states ........  15 
A.   Schools fund college athletics because 
they beneﬁt students, communities, and 
states, not because they are a money-
making endeavor .................................  15

The issue of student-athlete compensation is com-
plex, and it deserves a full, unfettered national discus-
sion to ensure the fair treatment of student-athletes 
while also protecting the matchless beneﬁts that col-
lege athletics provide to institutions of higher educa-
tion, their students, and the public. The injunction below cuts off that important discussion based on an untenable view of Federal antitrust law. This Court should reverse.",,,,da2985

In conclusion:
• 
The NCAA is not a sports league.
• 
The NCAA is not a production joint venture.
• 
Amateur college sports can exist without the 
NCAA.
• 
The NCAA facilitates a member conference 
cartel over college athletes.
The upshot of these conclusions is that the “joint 
venture” NCAA, designed and implemented by member 
conferences and independents, is a price fixing 
cartel over college athletes. The collusion of member 
conferences and independents to fix this input price is 
not necessary for member conferences and independents 
to fulfill their necessary function of creating conference 
and independent play. While most of the debate is about 
the fairness to athletes, economics adds that there 
are efficiency losses to this cartel behavior and that 
removing the cartel actually produces efficiency gains 
that the courts are not considering yet.
Amici urge the Court to add these conclusions from 
the economic analysis of sports and reject the erroneous 
“joint venture” plea by the NCAA.
It is in the interests of society that the full array of 
antitrust relief be considered in any joint venture activity 
arousing suspicion of anticompetitive behavior. The 
demands that no further rule of reason “burden” be put 
upon “the NCAA”, and that member conferences acting 
via their NCAA deserve even more antitrust leniency, are 
unsupported by economic findings.",,,,da2985

consistent with Title V's structure of 
funding sovereign entities and their 
political subdivisions

The Secretary's interpretation of the 
CARES Act results in double counting 
segments of Alaska's population, 
unfairly directing funds to the ANCs at 
the expense of federally recognized 
tribes

Amici States and the recognized tribes within 
their borders are striving, through their CARES Act 
Title V funding allocation, to serve the needs of all 
their citizens and members. And they are doing so 
with an allocation of funds based upon their popula-
tions. The Secretary's interpretation of the CARES 
Act and ISDA is incorrect as a matter of statutory con-
struction, and it deprives the recognized tribes of the 
full amount of funds to which they are entitled to 
serve their members.

86. Stone Creek asserts claims for federal and com-
mon law trademark infringement and Lanham 
Act unfair competition. 
87. A trademark is any word, name, symbol, device, or 
any combination thereof, used by a person to iden-
tify and distinguish that person’s goods from those 
of others and to indicate the source of the goods, 
even if that source is generally unknown. 15 U.S.C. 
§ 1127. 
88. “A trademark is a limited property right in a par-
ticular word, phrase or symbol.” New Kids on the 
Block v. New Am. Pub., Inc., 971 F.2d 302, 306 (9th 
Cir. 1992). It identifies the source of goods. 
Brookfield Commc’ns, Inc. v. W. Coast Entm’t Corp., 
174 F.3d 1036, 1051 (9th Cir. 1999). 
89. To prevail on its trademark infringement and un-
fair competition claims, Stone Creek must show: 
(1) it owns a valid mark; (2) the mark was used 
without its consent; and (3) such unauthorized use 
is likely to cause confusion among ordinary con-
sumers as to the source, sponsorship, affiliation, or 
approval of the goods. See Credit One Corp. v. 
Credit One Fin., Inc., 661 F. Supp. 2d 1134, 1137 
(C.D. Cal. 2009) (collecting cases and authorities).",,,,da2985
