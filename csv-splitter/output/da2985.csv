demands that no further rule of reason “burden” be put 
upon “the NCAA”, and that member conferences acting

I.
CIRI’s role in providing services to the 
region’s Alaska Natives and American Indians is 
unique and irreplaceable ................................................ 9
A. ANCs were created by ANCSA to serve an 
Indian law purpose and to provide programs 
and services to Alaska Natives and American 
Indians ................................................................... 10
B. Under ISDEAA, Congress has transferred to 
CIRI its responsibility to care for Alaska 
Natives ................................................................... 13
C. Loss of CIRI’s status under ISDEAA could 
threaten services for more than 40% of 
Alaska’s Natives .................................................... 19
II. CIRI’s provision of critical services to Alaska 
Natives and American Indians demonstrates 
that ANCs satisfy the Eligibility Clause .................. 26
A. Congress and the Executive Branch recognize

that only fourth-priority CIRI amongst all of the parties 
was entitled to request the award of a service contract un-
der the ISDEA.  The court concludes that the question of 
whether or not the IHS has not applied its own priority 
guidelines by failing to consider and find that Anchorage 
is a village for purposes of the guidelines was not actually 
or necessarily decided in CINA.

Amici States and the recognized tribes within 
their borders are striving, through their CARES Act 
Title V funding allocation, to serve the needs of all 
their citizens and members. And they are doing so 
with an allocation of funds based upon their popula-
tions. The Secretary's interpretation of the CARES 
Act and ISDA is incorrect as a matter of statutory con-
struction, and it deprives the recognized tribes of the 
full amount of funds to which they are entitled to 
serve their members.

not satisfy the ISDA definition.”  Pet. App. 11a.  The 
Court should reject the Ute Indian Tribe’s argument as 
an alternative ground for affirmance.  See Gov’t Br. 40 
n.8. 
As the district court explained, see Pet. App. 67a-
68a, the CARES Act’s definition of “Tribal government” 
is materially indistinguishable from a portion of ISDA’s 
definition of a “tribal organization.”  Compare 42 U.S.C. 
801(g)(5) (“recognized governing body of an Indian 
Tribe”), with 25 U.S.C. 5304(l ) (“recognized governing 
body of any Indian tribe”).  An ANC has long been un-
derstood to have a “recognized governing body” under 
that language; for example, each regional corporation 
has a board of directors, in whom management respon-
sibilities are vested.  43 U.S.C. 1606(f ); see, e.g., J.A. 45 
(Interior’s 1976 memorandum on ANC eligibility, ex-
plaining that the “corporation’s board of directors  * * *  
is its ‘governing body’ ” for these purposes).  That con-
struction flows from the plain meaning of the statutory 
language.  Corporations are commonly understood to 
have a “governing body.”  See, e.g., Black’s Law Dic-
tionary 839 (11th ed. 2019) (defining “governing body” 
to mean “government” or “[a] group of (esp. corporate)
