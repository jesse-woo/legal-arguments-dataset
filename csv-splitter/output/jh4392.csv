constitutionally violate the right to privacy in Californians’ (or

The 
California 
Constitution is unequivocal: 
All people are by nature free and independent and have 
inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and 
defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and 
protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, 
happiness, and privacy. 
Cal. Const. art. I, § 1 (emphasis added).  If its legislature cannot 
intrude upon these constitutional rights, a fortiori, a lone 
member of the executive branch lacks such power.",,,,jh4392

This Court has held that compelled disclosure can 
violate associational rights guaranteed under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To 
protect these rights, this Court has developed a test 
that it described as strict. The lower courts, however, 
and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
here, have applied a diluted version of this Court’s 
test, permitting compelled disclosure in nearly all 
circumstances. To respect the Framers’ defense of 
speaking without disclosing the identity of the 
speaker, to restore the Framers’ view of compelled 
disclosure with “just Alarm,” to provide clarity and 
predictability to states, courts, and speakers, and 
because compelled disclosure has recently caused 
harm to First Amendment associational rights, this 
Court should, as Petitioners urge, apply strict 
scrutiny.

The Ninth Circuit’s decision seriously undermines 
the rights of speech and association. Considering the 
historical constancy of governmental abuse and how 
donors are exposed to significant doxxing risks, this 
Court 
should 
hold 
that 
disclosure 
laws 
and 
regulations must be subjected to exacting scrutiny, 
including a meaningful requirement of narrow 
tailoring.

A. The challenged reporting requirement  
is not a public disclosure law ........................... 5

attrition or “chill.” .......................................... 10 
D. Requiring charities to confidentially  
report their major donors to state tax  
authorities does not categorically impose 
“severe burdens on free association.” ............ 13 
II. ANY FIRST AMENDMENT BURDENS HERE ARE 
MINIMAL, SO STRICT SCRUTINY REVIEW—OR 
ITS EQUIVALENT—IS NOT WARRANTED ................ 15 
A. Disclosure laws are subject to exacting 
scrutiny and “substantial relation” review ... 15 
ii 
 
B. Petitioners ignore that the standard of  
review is calibrated to the severity of the 
First Amendment injury ................................ 18 
C. That electoral disclosure is distinguish-
able does not bolster petitioners’ case for 
strict scrutiny ................................................. 22

A. This case presents no opportunity for the

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",,,,jh4392

Because religious liberty is the first and foremost 
of 
our 
God-given 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution, it is entirely appropriate that this 
Court invoke the First Amendment to establish that 
church employment matters are exempt from 
government control.  By so doing, the Court can 
extricate itself from the quagmire of having to 
perpetually examine church doctrine, tradition, and 
polity to determine who is and is not a minister for 
purposes of a ministerial exception. 
 
If the Court is not willing to take that step, the 
Foundation urges the Court to defer to the 
determinations of church authorities that their 
employees are ministers absent compelling reasons to 
the contrary.

For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit should be

qualifies as its minister.

The Ninth Circuit’s approach in Biel and 
Morrissey-Berru is inconsistent with this Court’s 
decision in Hosanna-Tabor and the intent of the 
Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. This Court 
should reject that faulty approach and endorse that 
followed by the other circuits, which considers the 
function performed by the religious organization’s 
employee and whether that function is religiously 
important. To avoid impermissible interference in 
religious affairs, and to mitigate potential harm to 
minority religions, this Court should instruct courts to 
defer to the religious organization’s sincerely held 
belief regarding the importance of the religious 
function.",,,,jh4392
