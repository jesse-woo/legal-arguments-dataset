STATEMENT OF THE CASE ..................................... 1 
REASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT ..................... 7 
I. 
There is no split among the courts of appeals ..... 9 
A. All circuits treat certification decisions as 
case-specific exercises of discretion ................ 9 
B. Petitioners’ asserted circuit splits do not 
withstand scrutiny ........................................ 10 
C. Even if there were some variation in the 
circuits’ discretionary certification practices, 
that would not establish a split warranting 
this Court’s review.......................................... 15 
II. This unusual case would be a poor vehicle for 
considering the question presented ................... 16 
III. The Sixth Circuit did not abuse its discretion .... 18 
A. The circumstances of this case amply 
justified the Sixth Circuit’s decision not 
to certify ......................................................... 18 
B. The Sixth Circuit’s case-specific decision 
neither undermines Tennessee’s sovereign 
interests nor encourages forum shopping ....... 21 
C. Jackson National’s proposed certification 
rules lack merit ............................................. 23 
IV. The Court should reject Jackson National’s 
alternative request to hold this case 
pending the Tennessee Supreme Court’s 
decision in McClay .............................................. 25

Because CAAF had no power to judge the
constitutionality of Article 120’s death sentence, this
Court should hold that CAAF erred when it held that
the statute of limitations for rape is five years.

4 The fact that Dr. Chen’s simulated maps were allowed into evidence at all will be a crucial 
issue on appeal. The evidentiary issues surrounding Dr. Chen’s simulations are legion. See Mot. In 
Limine to Exclude Expert Report of Dr. Chen (ECF No. 147). Among other things, Dr. Chen deleted 
his source code which deprived Defendants’ experts from assessing, inter alia, the reliability of the 
simulations. See id.; see also Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 43 F.3d 1311, 1319 (9th Cir. 1995). 
Dr. Chen also failed to program Michigan’s proper redistricting criteria. See Mot. In Limine to Exclude 
Expert Report of Dr. Chen at 16-18 (ECF No. 147).",,,,jh4392

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",,,,jh4392

After this Court’s decision in CLS, “the right of 
association bore little resemblance to the right of 
assembly that had existed for almost two hundred 
years of our nation’s history.”87  In deciding these 
cases, this Court should return to the text of the First 
Amendment and reconfirm its earlier precedent that 
the right of assembly stands on a co-equal footing with 
other First Amendment freedoms.

15 This is not to say that the California Legislature could

All people are by nature free and independent and have 
inalienable rights. Among these are enjoying and 
defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing, and 
protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining safety, 
happiness, and privacy. 
Cal. Const. art. I, § 1 (emphasis added).  If its legislature cannot 
intrude upon these constitutional rights, a fortiori, a lone

This Court has held that compelled disclosure can 
violate associational rights guaranteed under the 
First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. To 
protect these rights, this Court has developed a test 
that it described as strict. The lower courts, however, 
and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
here, have applied a diluted version of this Court’s 
test, permitting compelled disclosure in nearly all 
circumstances. To respect the Framers’ defense of 
speaking without disclosing the identity of the 
speaker, to restore the Framers’ view of compelled 
disclosure with “just Alarm,” to provide clarity and 
predictability to states, courts, and speakers, and 
because compelled disclosure has recently caused 
harm to First Amendment associational rights, this 
Court should, as Petitioners urge, apply strict 
scrutiny.
