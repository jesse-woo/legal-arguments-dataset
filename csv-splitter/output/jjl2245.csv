ARGUMENT ......................................................................... 3 
 
I.  STRUCTURAL PARTISAN BALANCE 
REQUIREMENTS FOCUSING ON PARTISAN 
AFFILIATION ARE PREVALENT IN FEDERAL 
AND STATE GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS. ........ 3 
 
A.  Partisan Balance Requirements Are 
Widespread. ............................................................. 3 
 
B.  Invalidating Delaware’s Judicial Partisan 
Balance Requirement In A Broadly Worded 
Opinion Will Create Chaos. ................................... 23 
 
II.  ALTHOUGH PARTISAN BALANCE 
REQUIREMENTS MAY BE LEGALLY 
ACCEPTABLE, IT IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL FOR 
GOVERNMENTS TO DETERMINE WHO IS ‘TOO 
REPUBLICAN’ OR ‘TOO DEMOCRATIC’ WITHIN 
THESE STRUCTURES................................................ 24 
 
A.  Challenges To Governmental Partisan 
Determinations ....................................................... 24 
 
B.  Government should not be in the business of 
determining who is “too Republican” or “too 
Democratic.” .......................................................... 31

For the aforementioned reasons, Amici curiae 
respectfully request that this Court uphold the 
notion that partisan balance in certain government 
institutions can be a worthy and constitutional 
objective, while not deciding the case in a manner 
that would foreclose or decide in advance how to 
handle statutes that engage in line drawing and 
exclusions beyond self-declared partisan affiliations.

Argument: 
A. 
The state supreme courts erred in upholding the

1. 
Specific jurisdiction requires contacts related 
to the claim, not just general connections to 
the forum ................................................................. 8 
2. 
Specific jurisdiction turns on the conduct of 
the defendant, not the unilateral acts of other 
parties ................................................................... 14 
3. 
The claims here do not arise out of or relate 
to the forum-state contacts identified by the 
state supreme courts ........................................... 19 
B. 
No sound justification supports the state supreme 
courts’ contrary theory of jurisdiction ....................... 21 
1. 
This Court’s cases do not support the state 
courts’ exercise of jurisdiction ............................ 21 
2. 
The forum States’ interests do not justify  
the state courts’ exercise of jurisdiction ............ 24 
3. 
The plaintiffs’ interests do not justify the 
state courts’ exercise of jurisdiction .................. 26 
C. 
This Court should not adopt Ford’s proximate-
cause test for specific jurisdiction .............................. 29 
D. 
These cases raise no issues concerning 
constitutional limits on the personal jurisdiction 
of federal courts ........................................................... 32

113. In support of her motion, Petitioner has set 
forth a prima facie case of entitlement to judgment 
as a matter of law dismissing the objections to pro-

and testamentary capacity, she has submitted tes-
timony and documentary evidence demonstrating

All Curtin's affirmations were without back-up 
materials. I repeated my arguments because they avoi-
ded discussing any of them in their October 28, 2019 
Brief in Opposition. They misapplied questionable legal 
theories such as a ""probate execution"" to misdirect this 
Court. They denied facts and commit perjuries by 
making affirmations 
Judge Rita Mella listened to them and commit-
ted serious abuses of discretion. No State Supreme 
Court provided proper oversight, refusing to even ack-
nowledge that a final judgment has been issued and is 
ripe for their review. Now they warn the U.S Supreme 
court not to interfere in decisions made by the State 
courts. Things they did were dirty and immoral. We 
cannot make sure everybody is clean in this world but 
we should at least prevent dirty people from messing 
up our courtrooms. That is one of the reason we are 
here. 
Pia Fields will publish this brief as a book to let 
people know this story and watch its ending . . . . She 
believes people, particularly the Chinese would like 
to know how things are run in the U.S. courthouses 
when the Americans talk about justice. Hopefully by 
selling books we can get the $100,000 legal fee back.",,,,jjl2245

The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-
tomary international law prohibition against slavery 
applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action 
under the ATS against domestic corporations for  
violating that norm. The judgment of the court of  
appeals should be affirmed.
