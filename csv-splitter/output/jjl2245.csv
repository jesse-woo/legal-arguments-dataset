The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-
tomary international law prohibition against slavery 
applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action 
under the ATS against domestic corporations for  
violating that norm. The judgment of the court of  
appeals should be affirmed.

ARGUMENT ................................................................ 6 
I. This Administration’s Radical Departure 
From The Longstanding Executive Branch 
Reading Of The ATS Flouts The Settled 
Understanding Of All Three Branches Of 
The Federal Government. ..................................... 6 
A.  For several decades, the Executive 
Branch has taken the view that federal 
courts have original jurisdiction over 
civil actions for torts committed in 
violation of the law of nations, without 
exempting torts committed by U.S. 
corporations. ..................................................... 7 
B. This Administration’s new claim that 
U.S. corporate liability is “a question for 
Congress” ignores that Congress has 
already decided that U.S. corporations 
may be held liable for supporting 
human trafficking, slavery, and forced 
labor. ............................................................... 11 
C. Consistent judicial precedent reinforces 
the longstanding statutory 
interpretation that U.S. corporations 
are not immune from civil liability 
under the ATS. ............................................... 15 
ii 
 
II. Rewriting The Statute To Add A 
Categorical Bar To U.S. Corporate Liability 
Would Undermine U.S. Foreign Policy. .............. 16 
A. Categorically barring U.S. corporate 
liability under the ATS would 
undermine congressional and executive 
actions to promote U.S. corporate 
leadership on human rights and forced 
labor. ............................................................... 18 
B. Domestic corporate liability under the 
ATS comports with the U.S. 
government’s broad foreign policy goals 
of promoting good corporate behavior 
abroad by U.S. actors. .................................... 23 
C. There is no need for a categorical bar on 
ATS liability for domestic corporations 
because judicial tools of civil procedure 
can effectively eliminate frivolous 
claims. ............................................................. 27

A. Congress spent years studying and

provisions of the Trafficking Victims

United States courts are an appropriate forum to 
hear claims that United States citizens, whether 
individuals or corporations, have aided and abetted 
child slavery. Such conduct is no less horrendous and 
no less deserving of redress when the enslaved 
children are forced to labor outside our shores. 
 
 
Respectfully submitted. 
 
6 Not surprisingly given the TVPRA’s textual clarity on this 
matter, lower courts have routinely heard civil actions against 
corporate defendants under the TVPRA. Indeed, 66% of the 
lawsuits trafficking victims have filed under the TVPRA have 
named corporate or organizational defendants. See Alexander F. 
Levy, Federal Human Trafficking Civil Litigation: 15 Years of 
the Private Right of Action, Human Trafficking Legal Center 18

The Court should affirm the Fifth Circuit’s statu-

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should

The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility 
 
14 See Brief for the Private Petitioners at 2 (“The simple 
reality is that when the government intrudes on deeply sensitive 
religious beliefs through a mandate that admits of exceptions 
(both religious and non-religious), the way to eliminate the 
burden is to extend the exemption.”).",,,,jjl2245

ARGUMENT ............................................................... 8 
I.  
INTERPRETING THE ACA TO LIMIT AGENCIES’ 
AUTHORITY TO EXPAND RELIEF FROM THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE IS IN DEROGA-
TION OF THE CONSTITUTION’S VESTING OF 
ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN CONGRESS  ............ 8 
A. 
The ACA Includes No Intelligible 
Principle to Guide the Agencies in 
Determining What “Additional Pre-
ventive Care” They Should Mandate ...... 9 
B. 
By Vesting “All Legislative Powers” 
in Congress, the Constitution En-
sures that the Same Entity that Im-
poses a Constraint May also Relax It, 
but a Bar on Administrative Relief 
Would Defeat that Key Protection ........ 15 
C. 
When Agencies Undertake Lawmak-
ing Functions that Were Vested in 
Congress, Rules that Reduce the 
Scope of Regulatory Reach Raise 
Fewer Self-Governance Concerns ......... 18 
II. 
INTERPRETING THE ACA TO LIMIT AGENCIES’ 
AUTHORITY TO EXPAND RELIEF FROM THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE 
MANDATE 
UNDERMINES 
THE CONSTITUTION’S AND RFRA’S PROTEC-
TIONS FOR RELIGIOUS AMERICANS ..................... 20 
iii 
A. The Constitution Secures the Religious 
Liberty of Americans Both Through the 
First Amendment and by Vesting “All 
Legislative Powers” in Congress ................. 20 
 
B. Congress Adopted RFRA in Part to 
Counteract the Tendency of Unelected 
Courts and Administrative Agencies to 
Devalue Free-Exercise Interests ................ 24
