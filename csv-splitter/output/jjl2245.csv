adopt”].) Plaintiff, therefore, has forfeited all his contentions on 
appeal. We nonetheless briefly address several of plaintiffs 
arguments to the extent they are supported by citations to legal 
authorities.
Plaintiff contends defendants should have filed the notice of 
removal to federal court within 30 days of purportedly receiving 
copies of the complaint by mail on May 24, 2019. As his sole 
authority, plaintiff cites Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc. v. Murphy 
Bros. (11th Cir. 1997) 125 F.3d 1396, 1398, which is no longer 
good law. In Michetti, the Eleventh Circuit held that the 30-day 
removal period under 28 U.S.C. § 1146 “begins to rim when a 
defendant actually receives a copy of a filed initial pleading by 
any means.” The United States Supreme Court reversed, 
however, holding that the time to remove “is triggered by 
simultaneous service of the summons and complaint, or receipt of 
the complaint, ‘through service or otherwise,’ after and apart 
from service of the summons, but not by mere receipt of the 
complaint unattended by any formal service.” (Murphy Bros. v. 
Michetti Pipe Stringing, Inc. (1999) 526 U.S. 344, 347—348.) Thus, 
defendants’ time to remove the case to federal court was not 
triggered until they were formally served with the complaint and 
summons.
Plaintiff also contends the motion to quash was not timely 
filed after the federal court remanded the case back to the state 
court. Section 430.90, subdivision (a)(1), provides 30 days to file a 
motion to quash service of summons “from the day the original 
court receives the case on remand.” Here, the federal court issued 
its order remanding this case back to the Superior Court on July 
9, 2019. Defendants filed the motion to quash thirty days later,

For the aforementioned reasons, Amici curiae 
respectfully request that this Court uphold the 
notion that partisan balance in certain government 
institutions can be a worthy and constitutional 
objective, while not deciding the case in a manner 
that would foreclose or decide in advance how to 
handle statutes that engage in line drawing and 
exclusions beyond self-declared partisan affiliations.

(Exhibit A, page 5, line 4 par 2). Sydney claimed 
that he could not read and Edward Curtin admitted 
that he never read the will out loud in front of the 
witnesses. (Exhibit E) 
) Yet the Will execution was considered duly by 
judge Mella. (Matter of Hubert 26 Misc. 461 57 
N.Y. Supp. 648 Affd. 48 App Div. 91, 62 N.Y. Supp. 
932 98 quoted in Annotated Consolidated Laws of 
New York 1917. Also see Matter of MacCready 82 
Misc. 2d 531, 369 N.Y.S. 2d 325 (1975). In that case 
the Will was valid only because it was read out loud 
in front of both of the witnesses and the testator 
who then signed. 
Being convinced by the petitioner’s lawyers 
Mella did not pay attention to a forged initial that 
made on the paper with the % of distributions. 
When no witness could confirm the content of the 
will, putting down an initial and substituting a 
page can easily change the whole will. Mella “sim-

All Curtin's affirmations were without back-up 
materials. I repeated my arguments because they avoi-
ded discussing any of them in their October 28, 2019 
Brief in Opposition. They misapplied questionable legal 
theories such as a ""probate execution"" to misdirect this 
Court. They denied facts and commit perjuries by 
making affirmations 
Judge Rita Mella listened to them and commit-
ted serious abuses of discretion. No State Supreme 
Court provided proper oversight, refusing to even ack-
nowledge that a final judgment has been issued and is 
ripe for their review. Now they warn the U.S Supreme 
court not to interfere in decisions made by the State 
courts. Things they did were dirty and immoral. We 
cannot make sure everybody is clean in this world but 
we should at least prevent dirty people from messing 
up our courtrooms. That is one of the reason we are 
here. 
Pia Fields will publish this brief as a book to let 
people know this story and watch its ending . . . . She 
believes people, particularly the Chinese would like 
to know how things are run in the U.S. courthouses 
when the Americans talk about justice. Hopefully by 
selling books we can get the $100,000 legal fee back.

The court of appeals in this case asked the correct 
question under international law: whether the cus-
tomary international law prohibition against slavery 
applies to corporations. Because the prohibition does, 
the United States is free to recognize a cause of action 
under the ATS against domestic corporations for  
violating that norm. The judgment of the court of  
appeals should be affirmed.
