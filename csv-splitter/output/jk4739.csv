In the end, the best protection for religious 
liberty is to vindicate the separation between church 
and state that the ministerial exception doctrine 
vindicates by recognizing separate spheres of 
competence:  a civil jurisdiction independent from 
the 
church 
and 
an 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction 
independent from the state in relation to religious 
matters.  By its nature, the ministerial exception 
doctrine is jurisdictional, not an affirmative defense.  
To assess the applicability of the doctrine in reaction 
to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no test can answer every 
question with fidelity to the First Amendment if that 
test is applied in a rigid and insensitive manner. The 
nature of the dispute must always be considered; 
regardless of the employee’s duties.  A religious 
organization may have a religious basis for the 
termination of employment that is protected by the 
First Amendment.  Whatever test they employ, the 
lower courts should be instructed to tread with 
caution 
and 
to 
consider 
carefully 
whether 
adjudicating the issues raised by the particular 
dispute will entangle the court in matters of faith.    
The Court can come closer to the ideal with a more 
sensitive, flexible and principled test.",,,,jk4739

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..................................... 3 
ARGUMENT ............................................................... 5 
I. 
The Assembly Clause Complements The 
Ministerial Exception And Further 
Supports Reversal In These Cases. .................... 5 
A. The Assembly Clause was originally 
understood to protect the rights of 
religious groups. ........................................... 5 
1. Early Congressional debates show 
that the Assembly Clause was meant 
to protect groups’ rights to form and 
to meet without government 
interference. .............................................6 
2. Throughout the Nineteenth Century, 
state court decisions relied on 
assembly rights to protect the rights 
of religious organizations to meet 
and to determine their own 
membership. ............................................9 
B. Modern First Amendment doctrine 
focuses on a right of “expressive 
association” that is narrower than 
the right of assembly. ................................. 12 
 
 
 
iv 
1. The Court’s Assembly Clause 
jurisprudence was robust and 
distinct during the 1930s and 1940s. .... 13 
2. The modern right of association is 
partially anchored in the Assembly 
Clause. .................................................... 15 
3. The Court’s decision in Roberts v. 
United States Jaycees formed a 
conceptual framework for the right 
of association distinct from the 
assembly right. ...................................... 17 
C. The Court should expressly recognize 
the Assembly Clause roots of the 
right of association in assessing the 
scope of the ministerial exception 
here. ............................................................ 21 
D. The Assembly Clause also prevents 
the state from interfering in 
Petitioners’ decisions regarding 
whom they empower to carry out 
their religious missions. ............................. 23 
 
 
 
v 
II. 
Hosanna-Tabor And Other Supreme Court 
Decisions Establish That The Assembly 
Clause, Along With The Religion Clauses, 
Provides Support For A Robust Ministerial 
Exception. .......................................................... 25 
III. Recognizing The Role Of The Assembly 
Clause Would Help Ensure Adequate 
Protection For The Rights Of Religious 
Groups. ............................................................... 30 
A. Christian Legal Society v. Martinez 
illustrates the risks of assessing 
religious groups’ right of association 
claims without regard to the 
Assembly Clause. ....................................... 30 
B. Lower court decisions upholding 
prohibitions on worship in public 
spaces illustrate the risks of 
assessing religious groups’ First 
Amendment claims without regard to 
the Assembly Clause. ................................. 32

The ministerial exception implements the reli-
gious freedoms of the Establishment Clause – the 
freedom from government interference in the selec-
tion and retention of individuals who will convey the 
message of a religious organization or pursue its mis-
sion.  The court should defer to the good-faith deter-
mination of the religious organization as to who those 
individuals are within the organization.
