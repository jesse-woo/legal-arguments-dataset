SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ...................................... 1 
ARGUMENT ................................................................ 5 
I. PETITIONERS’ THEORY OF ASSOCIATIONAL 
INJURY IS BASED ON EXTRAPOLATION AND 
CONJECTURE, NOT ANY ACTUAL BURDEN ON 
FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS .................................... 5 
A. The challenged reporting requirement  
is not a public disclosure law ........................... 5 
B. Even if the possibility of public disclosure 
is credited, the information subject to 
Schedule B reporting is minimal and any 
First Amendment harm remains “highly 
speculative.” ..................................................... 8 
C. There is no evidence of significant donor 
attrition or “chill.” .......................................... 10 
D. Requiring charities to confidentially  
report their major donors to state tax  
authorities does not categorically impose 
“severe burdens on free association.” ............ 13 
II. ANY FIRST AMENDMENT BURDENS HERE ARE 
MINIMAL, SO STRICT SCRUTINY REVIEW—OR 
ITS EQUIVALENT—IS NOT WARRANTED ................ 15 
A. Disclosure laws are subject to exacting 
scrutiny and “substantial relation” review ... 15 
ii 
 
B. Petitioners ignore that the standard of  
review is calibrated to the severity of the 
First Amendment injury ................................ 18 
C. That electoral disclosure is distinguish-
able does not bolster petitioners’ case for 
strict scrutiny ................................................. 22 
D. The “substantial relation” standard does 
not require a least-restrictive-means test ..... 24 
III. PETITIONERS DEMAND UNDULY SWEEPING 
REMEDIES FOR THEIR CLAIMED FIRST 
AMENDMENT INJURIES.......................................... 27 
A. This case presents no opportunity for the 
Court to address public disclosure ................ 28 
B. Petitioners’ particularized argument is 
best addressed narrowly and does not 
support facial relief ........................................ 29 
C. Petitioners concede that not every collec-
tion of donor identifying information 
warrants strict scrutiny ................................. 31

The real harms suffered by AFPF and the Law 
Center (as well as amicus Defense Fund) and their 
donors are not unique or isolated. The testimony of 
experts at trial, the shared experiences of other 
charities, and common sense inform the conclusion 
that all nonprofit organizations who maintain 
confidential donor information (especially those that 
engage in controversial public issues, no matter what 
end of the political spectrum) are exposed to the same 
public 
threats, 
harassment, 
intimidation, 
and 
retaliation, much of which is today enabled by 
information technology that wasn’t even imagined at 
the time of NAACP v. Alabama. 
The outcome of this case has real consequences.  It 
is inevitable that people will suffer tangible harm if 
the California Attorney General’s unlawful practice is 
allowed to stand. The petitions for writs of certiorari 
should be granted on this issue of exceptional 
importance.",,,,jk4739

Because religious liberty is the first and foremost 
of 
our 
God-given 
rights 
guaranteed 
by 
the 
Constitution, it is entirely appropriate that this 
Court invoke the First Amendment to establish that 
church employment matters are exempt from 
government control.  By so doing, the Court can 
extricate itself from the quagmire of having to 
perpetually examine church doctrine, tradition, and 
polity to determine who is and is not a minister for 
purposes of a ministerial exception. 
 
If the Court is not willing to take that step, the 
Foundation urges the Court to defer to the 
determinations of church authorities that their 
employees are ministers absent compelling reasons to 
the contrary.

Religion Clauses of the First Amendment. This Court

followed by the other circuits, which considers the 
function performed by the religious organization’s 
employee and whether that function is religiously 
important. To avoid impermissible interference in 
religious affairs, and to mitigate potential harm to 
minority religions, this Court should instruct courts to 
defer to the religious organization’s sincerely held

In the end, the best protection for religious 
liberty is to vindicate the separation between church 
and state that the ministerial exception doctrine 
vindicates by recognizing separate spheres of 
competence:  a civil jurisdiction independent from 
the 
church 
and 
an 
ecclesiastical 
jurisdiction 
independent from the state in relation to religious 
matters.  By its nature, the ministerial exception 
doctrine is jurisdictional, not an affirmative defense.  
To assess the applicability of the doctrine in reaction 
to a Rule 12(b)(1) motion, no test can answer every 
question with fidelity to the First Amendment if that 
test is applied in a rigid and insensitive manner. The 
nature of the dispute must always be considered; 
regardless of the employee’s duties.  A religious 
organization may have a religious basis for the 
termination of employment that is protected by the 
First Amendment.  Whatever test they employ, the 
lower courts should be instructed to tread with 
caution 
and 
to 
consider 
carefully 
whether 
adjudicating the issues raised by the particular 
dispute will entangle the court in matters of faith.    
The Court can come closer to the ideal with a more 
sensitive, flexible and principled test.",,,,jk4739

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..................................... 3 
ARGUMENT ............................................................... 5 
I. 
The Assembly Clause Complements The 
Ministerial Exception And Further 
Supports Reversal In These Cases. .................... 5 
A. The Assembly Clause was originally 
understood to protect the rights of 
religious groups. ........................................... 5 
1. Early Congressional debates show 
that the Assembly Clause was meant 
to protect groups’ rights to form and 
to meet without government 
interference. .............................................6 
2. Throughout the Nineteenth Century, 
state court decisions relied on 
assembly rights to protect the rights 
of religious organizations to meet 
and to determine their own 
membership. ............................................9 
B. Modern First Amendment doctrine 
focuses on a right of “expressive 
association” that is narrower than 
the right of assembly. ................................. 12 
 
 
 
iv 
1. The Court’s Assembly Clause 
jurisprudence was robust and 
distinct during the 1930s and 1940s. .... 13 
2. The modern right of association is 
partially anchored in the Assembly 
Clause. .................................................... 15 
3. The Court’s decision in Roberts v. 
United States Jaycees formed a 
conceptual framework for the right 
of association distinct from the 
assembly right. ...................................... 17 
C. The Court should expressly recognize 
the Assembly Clause roots of the 
right of association in assessing the 
scope of the ministerial exception 
here. ............................................................ 21 
D. The Assembly Clause also prevents 
the state from interfering in 
Petitioners’ decisions regarding 
whom they empower to carry out 
their religious missions. ............................. 23 
 
 
 
v 
II. 
Hosanna-Tabor And Other Supreme Court 
Decisions Establish That The Assembly 
Clause, Along With The Religion Clauses, 
Provides Support For A Robust Ministerial 
Exception. .......................................................... 25 
III. Recognizing The Role Of The Assembly 
Clause Would Help Ensure Adequate 
Protection For The Rights Of Religious 
Groups. ............................................................... 30 
A. Christian Legal Society v. Martinez 
illustrates the risks of assessing 
religious groups’ right of association 
claims without regard to the 
Assembly Clause. ....................................... 30 
B. Lower court decisions upholding 
prohibitions on worship in public 
spaces illustrate the risks of 
assessing religious groups’ First 
Amendment claims without regard to 
the Assembly Clause. ................................. 32

The ministerial exception implements the reli-
gious freedoms of the Establishment Clause – the 
freedom from government interference in the selec-
tion and retention of individuals who will convey the 
message of a religious organization or pursue its mis-
sion.  The court should defer to the good-faith deter-
mination of the religious organization as to who those 
individuals are within the organization.

ARGUMENT................................................................ 5 
I. 
The ministerial exception protects the 
courts from exercising governmental 
authority to review religious determi-
nations ............................................................ 5 
II. Because of the protections afforded by 
the ministerial exception, its applica-
tion should be determined before courts 
reach the merits .............................................. 8 
A. If discovery is needed to decide if 
the ministerial exception applies, 
discovery should be limited to that 
issue ........................................................ 11 
B. If trial is necessary, courts should 
consider bifurcating trial on the 
ministerial exception from trial on 
the merits ............................................... 14 
C. Orders denying the application of 
the ministerial exception should be 
immediately appealable ......................... 15

The Court should reverse the judgments below. In 
so doing, the Court should clarify the structural 
protections afforded by the ministerial exception and 
instruct lower courts to resolve whether the
