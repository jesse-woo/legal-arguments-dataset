It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments
of the Second and D.C. Circuits and order entry of the
injunctions the President requests.",,,,jn2808

For its 230 year history, this Court has heeded 
Judge Montesquieu’s warning about legislative 
overreach working attainder. When any legislative 
body has defaming, punishment power, “the life and 
liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary 
control.”41  
Now, once again, this Court has opportunity and 
duty to take-up Colonel Alexander Hamilton’s cause 
to insure that defamatory attainder processes will 
not be allowed in America.

I. 
THE PRACTICE OF AVOIDING CONFLICTS

PRESIDENT’S PERSONAL FINANCES IS 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD 
AND STILL PERSISTS IN THE MODERN 
ERA. ..................................................................... 4 
A. 
Every branch of government acknowledges 
the need for economic restraints on a 
president’s personal finances to avoid 
conflicts of 
interest………………………………………. 4 
B. 
Throughout the Nation’s history, various 
presidents have placed restraints on their 
personal financial interests to avoid 
conflicts of

II. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DISCLOSURE AND 
DIVESTMENT DECISIONS DEPART FROM 
MODERN PRACTICE, RENDERING 
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ESSENTIAL. …17 
ii 
 
A. 
President Trump’s failure to divest or 
create blind trusts departs from 
presidential norms imposed by ethics-
related statutes……………………… …….17 
B. 
President Trump’s failure to divest or

appearance of impropriety with respect to 
his foreign and domestic business

A. Congress has a long, bipartisan history of

B. Presidents have generally complied with

particularized claim of privilege. ......................... 15

Congress indisputably chose to eliminate the 
individual mandate’s legal consequences while 
leaving the rest of the ACA intact. ...................... 4 
II. Congress’s choice definitively answers the 
question whether the individual mandate can

A. This Court’s precedents require it to honor 
congressional intent in determining whether 
to sever invalid statutory provisions. .............. 6 
B. Congress’s unambiguously expressed intent 
requires severance if the Court deems the 
individual mandate unconstitutional. ............. 9

There is no evidence that Congress, in lowering the 
tax associated with the individual-responsibility pro-
vision, intended to dismantle the ACA and thereby un-
dermine the critical gains for women’s health and eco-
nomic security attributable to it.  But that’s just what 
the courts below have done, and what this Court 
should reverse.

I. 
INVALIDATING THE ENTIRETY OF 
THE ACA WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC 
TO 
THE 
WELFARE 
OF 
MEMBER 
PLANS AND THEIR ENROLLEES. ................ 7 
A.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
advance 
premium 
tax 
credit 
will 
cause 
millions, including many of Member 
Plans’ enrollees, to lose coverage. ............... 9 
B.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
coverage 
requirements for persons with pre-
existing conditions puts the healthcare 
of the nation’s most vulnerable at risk. .... 12 
C.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
Medicaid 
expansion would strip health coverage 
away from those who cannot afford 
commercial insurance. .............................. 16 
D.  Invalidating the ACA will strain the 
Medicare 
budget 
and 
set 
back 
initiatives to enhance the quality of 
healthcare for older Americans. ............... 21

AFFORDABLE 
HEALTHCARE 
MADE 
POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE ACA IS A CRUCIAL

The Court should reverse the Fifth Circuit’s 
decision in its entirety.  But should the Court reach 
the issue of severability, it should hold that the 
individual mandate is severable from remainder of 
the ACA.

Over the course of a decade, the ACA has 
fundamentally reshaped the nation’s health care 
system.  Congress in 2017 chose not to disturb that 
paradigm shift—including the promise of affordable 
coverage for those with preexisting conditions—when 
defanging the individual mandate without repealing 
any other part of the ACA.   
Texas and the federal government would have 
this Court wield an axe in responding to Congress’s 
scalpel.  But invalidation of the ACA would flout",,,,jn2808
