Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.

It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments
of the Second and D.C. Circuits and order entry of the
injunctions the President requests.",,,,jn2808

It bears emphasis that the impermissibility of the
State court subpoena in 19-635 is merely an
additional reason to quash the subpoena in that
particular case. The primary reason, discussed above,
remains and applies in all 3 cases under review: The
subpoenas are not confined to the type of discrete and
limited intrusion into the Presidential function allowed
in Clinton v. Jones or U.S. v. Nixon but instead
constitute wide-ranging, virtually limitless and
blunderbuss commands for production of documents
that trigger a plausible risk of serious Presidential
distraction and diversion of energy and focus that will
impair the ability of the President to perform his
official duties.
The subpoenas contravene Article II of the
Constitution. This Court should reverse the judgments
of the Second and D.C. Circuits and order entry of the
injunctions the President requests.",,,,jn2808

For its 230 year history, this Court has heeded 
Judge Montesquieu’s warning about legislative 
overreach working attainder. When any legislative 
body has defaming, punishment power, “the life and 
liberty of the subject would be exposed to arbitrary 
control.”41  
Now, once again, this Court has opportunity and 
duty to take-up Colonel Alexander Hamilton’s cause 
to insure that defamatory attainder processes will 
not be allowed in America.

I. 
THE PRACTICE OF AVOIDING CONFLICTS

PRESIDENT’S PERSONAL FINANCES IS 
MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED YEAR OLD

ERA. ..................................................................... 4 
A. 
Every branch of government acknowledges 
the need for economic restraints on a 
president’s personal finances to avoid

presidents have placed restraints on their 
personal financial interests to avoid

II. 
PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DISCLOSURE AND 
DIVESTMENT DECISIONS DEPART FROM 
MODERN PRACTICE, RENDERING 
CONGRESSIONAL ACTION ESSENTIAL. …17 
ii 
 
A. 
President Trump’s failure to divest or 
create blind trusts departs from 
presidential norms imposed by ethics-
related statutes……………………… …….17

appropriately subpoenaed President 
Trump’s financial records to investigate

I. 
The Sole “Unprecedented” Aspect of This

Subpoenas ...................................................................... 4 
A. Time is of the essence in congressional 
investigations. ......................................................... 6 
B. Appropriate deference to legislative powers

to congressional subpoenas under a highly 
deferential standard of review. ............................. 7 
II. Every Feature of the Subpoenas at Issue Is 
Well-Rooted in Historical Practice ............................. 9 
A. Congress has a long, bipartisan history of 
issuing subpoenas for presidential records as 
part of its duties to investigate in support of 
its legislative functions. ........................................ 10 
B. Presidents have generally complied with 
congressional subpoenas absent a 
particularized claim of privilege. ......................... 15 
C. Congress has long lawfully delegated 
Congress’s power to issue subpoenas to 
committees under the Rules of the House. ........ 17 
D. If endorsed, petitioners’ approach could 
grind legitimate legislative investigations to 
a halt. ...................................................................... 22

I. 
Congress may investigate whether the 
President and other Executive officers have 
complied with the law and whether they have

A.  A congressional subpoena is constitutional if 
it seeks evidence pertinent to twhe subject
