The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility 
 
14 See Brief for the Private Petitioners at 2 (“The simple 
reality is that when the government intrudes on deeply sensitive 
religious beliefs through a mandate that admits of exceptions 
(both religious and non-religious), the way to eliminate the 
burden is to extend the exemption.”).",,,,rl3315

I.  
INTERPRETING THE ACA TO LIMIT AGENCIES’ 
AUTHORITY TO EXPAND RELIEF FROM THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE IS IN DEROGA-
TION OF THE CONSTITUTION’S VESTING OF 
ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN CONGRESS  ............ 8 
A. 
The ACA Includes No Intelligible 
Principle to Guide the Agencies in 
Determining What “Additional Pre-

B. 
By Vesting “All Legislative Powers” 
in Congress, the Constitution En-
sures that the Same Entity that Im-
poses a Constraint May also Relax It, 
but a Bar on Administrative Relief 
Would Defeat that Key Protection ........ 15

A federal court may only exercise judicial power 
consistent with the grant of power contained in the 
Constitution.  This means that remedies are limited 
to the parties before the court.  Once the plaintiff has 
a remedy, it no longer had authority to bring a case. 
Beyond the question of the injunction, there is no 
showing that Congress ever intended to enact a con-
traceptive mandate.  Therefore, the question of 
whether Congress intended there to be a conscience 
exemption from that mandate simply asks the wrong 
question.  This Court should reverse the judgment of 
the court below and dissolve the injunction.

promulgates the same rule. ................ 20

The Expanded Exemptions, if allowed to stand, will 
harm 
many 
individuals 
by 
depriving 
them 
of  
contraceptive coverage without cost sharing that is an 
essential element of the ACA’s integrated strategy to 
ensure access to fundamental preventive care.  Federal 
safety-net programs are simply not substitutes for 
employer- and university-sponsored insurance plans, and 
such programs lack the resources to accommodate 
individuals who stand to lose coverage under the 
Expanded Exemptions.  Further, current attacks on 
those programs combined with an influx of new patients 
would interfere with the safety-net programs’ ability to 
serve the patients of limited means for whom these 
programs were designed.

Argument ..................................................................    3 
  I. Presidential electors are not officers of the 
federal government, but they do exercise “federal 
functions”.  ...............................................................     3 
 
 II. The nature and scope of federal functions 
exercised by actors outside the federal government 
vary considerably.  ...................................................    4 
 
 III. Elector discretion is within the scope of 
elector authority, but the scope of authority of 
those exercising other federal functions varies wth 
each function. ...........................................................    8 
 
 IV. The distinctions in scope of authority among 
different federal functions justify the Court 
distinguishing its presidential elector holding 
from other federal functions.. ................................    16

The Court should carefully limit its holding to 
presidential electors, clarifying that the decision is 
not applicable to others performing federal functions.
