INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF 
ARGUMENT .................................................... 3 
ARGUMENT .............................................................. 6 
I. 
The 2017 Rules Were Procedurally 
Invalid. ............................................................. 6 
A. 
The agencies did not have good 
cause to forego notice and 
comment. ............................................... 8 
B. 
The agencies did not have 
statutory authorization to issue 
the 2017 Rules without notice 
and comment. ...................................... 12 
II. 
The Procedural Errors Infecting the 
2017 Rules Render the Essentially 
Identical 2018 Rules Similarly Invalid. ........ 15 
A. 
An agency that deviates from the 
APA’s prescribed procedures by 
frontloading rulemaking and 
tacking on comment as an 
afterthought has not given the 
public a meaningful “opportunity 
to participate in the rule 
making.” .............................................. 15 
 
 
 
ii 
 
 
B. 
An agency that violates section 
553 must establish it maintained 
an “open mind” when considering 
post-promulgation comments or 
have its rule vacated, irrespective 
of whether the agency swiftly re-
promulgates the same rule. ................ 20 
C. 
The agencies did not provide a 
meaningful opportunity to 
comment on the 2018 Rules................ 27

Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.

Although MEVC does not take a position on the 
questions presented, it respectfully urges the Court to 
provide ample guidance on crucial practical issues 
that will inevitably arise no matter what the Court 
rules in Baca and Chiafalo. That guidance is needed 
to help the States implement presidential election 
procedures that comply with Constitutional require-
ments, promote an enduring regularity in presidential 
elections, and accurately reflect the choices of all vot-
ers in our democratic republic.

Electors’ independence did not arise, or endure, by 
chance. It was critical to the compromise that secured 
the Constitution’s passage, and it was well-known to 
those who crafted the Twelfth Amendment. At the 
Founding, the Framers carefully considered arguments 
that electors should not be deliberative, and they 
carefully calibrated electors’ independence from the 
states (on one hand) and the people (on the other). The 
Twelfth Amendment debates recognized, and did not 
disturb, this independence.
