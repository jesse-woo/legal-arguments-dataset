The decision below is emblematic of a recent trend 
in the federal courts: (1) one administration adopts a 
discretionary policy that is not compelled by statute; 
(2) the next administration concludes that the 
discretionary policy is—or very likely may be—
unlawful and thus adopts a new policy to avoid 
burdensome litigation; (3) parties who preferred the 
original policy nevertheless file suit in districts across 
the country; (4) one or more judges disagrees with the 
executive branch about the legality of the reversal and 
enters a nationwide injunction. This case squarely 
presents a chance to review this increasing hostility 
 
14 See Brief for the Private Petitioners at 2 (“The simple 
reality is that when the government intrudes on deeply sensitive 
religious beliefs through a mandate that admits of exceptions 
(both religious and non-religious), the way to eliminate the 
burden is to extend the exemption.”).

C. The Court Should Hold that RFRA Re-
quired the Agencies To Adopt the Final 
Rule Because that Is the Most Straight-

D. The Court Should Hold that RFRA

ARGUMENT ............................................................... 8 
I.  
INTERPRETING THE ACA TO LIMIT AGENCIES’ 
AUTHORITY TO EXPAND RELIEF FROM THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE MANDATE IS IN DEROGA-
TION OF THE CONSTITUTION’S VESTING OF 
ALL LEGISLATIVE POWERS IN CONGRESS  ............ 8 
A. 
The ACA Includes No Intelligible 
Principle to Guide the Agencies in 
Determining What “Additional Pre-
ventive Care” They Should Mandate ...... 9 
B. 
By Vesting “All Legislative Powers” 
in Congress, the Constitution En-
sures that the Same Entity that Im-
poses a Constraint May also Relax It, 
but a Bar on Administrative Relief 
Would Defeat that Key Protection ........ 15 
C. 
When Agencies Undertake Lawmak-
ing Functions that Were Vested in 
Congress, Rules that Reduce the 
Scope of Regulatory Reach Raise 
Fewer Self-Governance Concerns ......... 18 
II. 
INTERPRETING THE ACA TO LIMIT AGENCIES’ 
AUTHORITY TO EXPAND RELIEF FROM THE 
CONTRACEPTIVE 
MANDATE 
UNDERMINES 
THE CONSTITUTION’S AND RFRA’S PROTEC-
TIONS FOR RELIGIOUS AMERICANS ..................... 20

A. The Constitution Secures the Religious 
Liberty of Americans Both Through the 
First Amendment and by Vesting “All

3 The exemption for moral objections, 83 Fed. Reg. 57,592 (Nov. 15, 
2018), is not at issue in this case, because the private petitioners are 
religious in the most traditional sense. The Court should not casually 
opine on the moral exemption without briefing, as the court below 
arguably did. Compare Pet. App. 43a n.27 (noting that no party 
defended the moral exemption under RFRA), with Douglas Laycock, 
Religious Liberty as Liberty, 7 J. Contemp. Legal Issues 313, 326-337 
(1996) (reviewing the evolution of religious beliefs to include 
nontheistic conscience and why nontheistic conscience must be 
protected by religious liberty).

A federal court may only exercise judicial power 
consistent with the grant of power contained in the 
Constitution.  This means that remedies are limited 
to the parties before the court.  Once the plaintiff has 
a remedy, it no longer had authority to bring a case. 
Beyond the question of the injunction, there is no 
showing that Congress ever intended to enact a con-
traceptive mandate.  Therefore, the question of 
whether Congress intended there to be a conscience 
exemption from that mandate simply asks the wrong 
question.  This Court should reverse the judgment of 
the court below and dissolve the injunction.

A.

The Expanded Exemptions, if allowed to stand, will 
harm 
many 
individuals 
by 
depriving 
them 
of  
contraceptive coverage without cost sharing that is an 
essential element of the ACA’s integrated strategy to 
ensure access to fundamental preventive care.  Federal 
safety-net programs are simply not substitutes for 
employer- and university-sponsored insurance plans, and 
such programs lack the resources to accommodate 
individuals who stand to lose coverage under the 
Expanded Exemptions.  Further, current attacks on 
those programs combined with an influx of new patients 
would interfere with the safety-net programs’ ability to 
serve the patients of limited means for whom these 
programs were designed.

 II. The nature and scope of federal functions

elector authority, but the scope of authority of 
those exercising other federal functions varies wth 
each function. ...........................................................    8

presidential electors, clarifying that the decision is
