Please uphold your oath to the Constitution by at least remanding this case for further
proceedings - reconsideration on the Plaintiffs constitutionality claims as well as the declaration
of the laws prohibiting cannabis and the continuous unlawful deprivation of rights by the
Appellant States, USA and Pennsylvania, through the continued arrest, prosecution, conviction,
incarceration, and criminal record representation for pot - a substance nearly anyone who is
educated knows is not as dangerous as alcohol - tobacco - cocaine - heroin - crack - etc - and
does in fact have medicinal value and use in the US - the representation of otherwise is false /
fraud / violation of due process - and the unequal impact this has had on minorities also makes it
unconstitutional - declaring the Plaintiff correct in their intentions - at the minimum.
I certainly do apologize to the citizens involved on both sides of the matter - to the Court
- the Law School - students involved - officers involved - etc - because I do understand they were
trying their best to uphold law and order from their perspective - and so I do recognize that
nothing is perfect. But we, as an American, can certainly do better. I’m willing to admit my
mistakes and make changes and my patience throughout the 5 years+ of this litigation is
testament to this factually.

The Bator family is engaged in a legal battle with the legal community employed in 
Siskiyou County. Anthony Bator is in prison for a crime that was never committed. He 
has been prosecuted because he chose to sue assistant district attorney Christine Winte 
for her illegally removing the Bator child from the Bator home.
The prosecution was absolutely in retaliation for the Bator’s holding Ms. Winte and 
her coconspirators liable, civilly and hopefully criminally, for their illegal acts; that 
community chose to prosecute Bator.
Mr. Bator cannot isceive a fair trial in Siskiyou County. Judge Dixon works with all 
of the defendants who arc involved in California Court of Appeals for the Third District

A. Mr. El-Amin has a non-unanimous jury conviction.............................................
B. non-unanimous jury convictions violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
Discriminatory intent.............................................................................................
C. The Holding in Ramos applies to Mr. EI-Amin....................................................
1. The Courts determined 40 years ago that rules relating to non-unanimous jury verdicts 
should be retroactive
2. The Ramos decision restates the principle that governed prior Supreme Court cases, 
therefore it should be applied to Mr. El-Amin's case
3. Alternatively, Teague v. Lane requires retroactive application of the holding in Ramos v. 
Louisiana because it is a “watershed rule.”
4. Alternatively, the State of Louisiana should depart from Teague v. Lane, as allowed in 
Danforth v. Minnesota
5. The Ramos Court now acknowledges its mistake in Apodaca, and but for this mistake, Mr. 
El-Amin would have had a constitutional trial

I.   The trial court erred as a matter of law by 
dismissing Lemon’s discrimination and 
retaliation claims under Title VII for 
purported failure to state a claim since 
Lemon 
was 
entitled 
to 
protections 
afforded by Title VII when properly

when it dismissed Lemon’s race discrimi-
nation claim under Section 1981 for its 
purported failure to state a claim under 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) since Lemon alleged 
sufficient facts giving rise to a reasonable

ARGUMENT ................................................................ 10 
 
I. 
To Assure that Older South 
Carolinians Can Vote Safely, the 
State Must Limit High-Risk, 
Interpersonal Contact in the 
November Election ........................................... 10 
 
A. For Medically Vulnerable 
Older Voters, Risk of COVID-
19 Infection for the General 
Election Would Be 
Unacceptably High If the 
Witness Requirement Is 
Enforced and, Thus, Absentee 
Voting Requires Close Contact 
with Persons Whose 
Compliance with Anti-Virus 
Measures Is Unknown................................ 10 
ii 
 
 
B. Risks of Serious Harm, 
Including Death, Due to 
COVID-19 Are Especially 
High for Older South 
Carolinians .................................................. 14 
 
C. The COVID-19 Crisis—and 
Dangers Related to 
Enforcement of the Witness 
Requirement—Will Still Be 
Present in November .................................. 20 
 
D. Enforcing the Witness 
Requirement Would Be 
Especially Perverse Given the 
Higher Levels of Electoral 
Participation of Older Voters 
Who Are Most at Risk from 
COVID-19 .................................................... 22 
 
II. 
The Witness Requirement as 
Applied to the November General 
Election in South Carolina 
Violates the U.S. Constitution by 
Creating an Undue Risk of 
Serious Injury or Death for 
Medically Vulnerable Voters, 
Most of Whom Are Older ................................. 25 
  
CONCLUSION ............................................................. 29

The District Court Properly Applied the Anderson-Burdick          
Standard  to Determine that Respondents Were Likely to Succeed

For the reasons stated above, amici respectfully urge 
the Court to clarify that Purcell issues no command and 
creates no presumption against courts’ injunction of po-
tentially unlawful voting rules in the period before an elec-
tion.  Instead, Purcell confirms that courts should con-
sider all relevant factors, given the context presented, in 
deciding whether an injunction is warranted.

the District Court” was “error.” 549 U.S. at 5. Here, by contrast, the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
