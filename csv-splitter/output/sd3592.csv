Please uphold your oath to the Constitution by at least remanding this case for further
proceedings - reconsideration on the Plaintiffs constitutionality claims as well as the declaration
of the laws prohibiting cannabis and the continuous unlawful deprivation of rights by the
Appellant States, USA and Pennsylvania, through the continued arrest, prosecution, conviction,
incarceration, and criminal record representation for pot - a substance nearly anyone who is
educated knows is not as dangerous as alcohol - tobacco - cocaine - heroin - crack - etc - and
does in fact have medicinal value and use in the US - the representation of otherwise is false /
fraud / violation of due process - and the unequal impact this has had on minorities also makes it
unconstitutional - declaring the Plaintiff correct in their intentions - at the minimum.
I certainly do apologize to the citizens involved on both sides of the matter - to the Court
- the Law School - students involved - officers involved - etc - because I do understand they were
trying their best to uphold law and order from their perspective - and so I do recognize that
nothing is perfect. But we, as an American, can certainly do better. I’m willing to admit my
mistakes and make changes and my patience throughout the 5 years+ of this litigation is
testament to this factually.

example, if you are claiming incompetence of counsel, you must state facts specifically setting forth what your attorney did or 
failed to do and how that affected your trial. Failure to allege sufficient facts will result in the denial of your petition. (See In re 
Swain (1949) 34 Cal.2d 300, 304.) A rule of thumb to follow is, who did exactly whatto violate your rights at what time (when) or 
place (where).

The Bator family is engaged in a legal battle with the legal community employed in 
Siskiyou County. Anthony Bator is in prison for a crime that was never committed. He 
has been prosecuted because he chose to sue assistant district attorney Christine Winte 
for her illegally removing the Bator child from the Bator home.
The prosecution was absolutely in retaliation for the Bator’s holding Ms. Winte and 
her coconspirators liable, civilly and hopefully criminally, for their illegal acts; that 
community chose to prosecute Bator.
Mr. Bator cannot isceive a fair trial in Siskiyou County. Judge Dixon works with all 
of the defendants who arc involved in California Court of Appeals for the Third District

A. Mr. El-Amin has a non-unanimous jury conviction.............................................
B. non-unanimous jury convictions violate the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments
Discriminatory intent.............................................................................................
C. The Holding in Ramos applies to Mr. EI-Amin....................................................
1. The Courts determined 40 years ago that rules relating to non-unanimous jury verdicts 
should be retroactive
2. The Ramos decision restates the principle that governed prior Supreme Court cases, 
therefore it should be applied to Mr. El-Amin's case
3. Alternatively, Teague v. Lane requires retroactive application of the holding in Ramos v. 
Louisiana because it is a “watershed rule.”
4. Alternatively, the State of Louisiana should depart from Teague v. Lane, as allowed in 
Danforth v. Minnesota
5. The Ramos Court now acknowledges its mistake in Apodaca, and but for this mistake, Mr. 
El-Amin would have had a constitutional trial

Americans and it has been successful. For the last 120 years, it has silenced and sidelined African-
Americans in criminal proceedings and cause questionable convictions throughout Louisiana.
The post-Reconstniction Louisiana Constitutional Convention of 1898 sought to “establish the
supremacy of the white race.” Ramos. 140 S.Ct. at 1394. It “approved non-unanimous juries as one
pillar of comprehensive and brutal program of racist Jim Crow' measures against African-Americans,
especially in voting and juiy service.” Id, at 1417 (Kavanangh, I, concurring in part). “[A] ware that
this Court would strike down any policy of overt discrimination against African-American jurors as a
violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the delegates sought to undermine African-American
participation on juries in another way. With a careful eye on racial demographics, the convention
delegates sculpted a 'facially race-neutral” rule ... in order “to ensure that African-American juror
service would be. meaningless.'”Id.
Data allowing that votes of African-American jurors have been disproportionately silenced is
compelling evidence that the use of pve-Ramos rule affected the fundamental fairness and accuracy of
criminal trials. “In light of the racist origins of the non-unanimous jury, it is no surprise that non-

purported failure to state a claim under 
Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) since Lemon alleged

This Court should deny the application for a stay. 
 
27  
Indeed, given the significant penalties for voter fraud, a witness-signature 
requirement is not likely to provide an additional deterrent.  As one court recently 
observed, “[f]or the fraudster who would dare to sign the name of another qualified 
voter at the risk of being [criminally] charged . . . writing out an illegible scrawl on 
an envelope to satisfy the witness requirement would seem to present little to no 
additional obstacle.”  League of Women Voters of Va., 2020 WL 2158249, at *9.

To Assure that Older South

November Election ........................................... 10 
 
A. For Medically Vulnerable 
Older Voters, Risk of COVID-
19 Infection for the General 
Election Would Be 
Unacceptably High If the 
Witness Requirement Is 
Enforced and, Thus, Absentee 
Voting Requires Close Contact

Compliance with Anti-Virus

COVID-19 Are Especially

Dangers Related to 
Enforcement of the Witness 
Requirement—Will Still Be

Requirement Would Be 
Especially Perverse Given the 
Higher Levels of Electoral 
Participation of Older Voters 
Who Are Most at Risk from

II. 
The Witness Requirement as 
Applied to the November General
