By design, Nebraska’s HHA Program, like the New 
Hampshire and Arkansas work requirements pro-
grams, removes coverage of important benefits con-
trary to the purposes of Medicaid. Additionally, an 
opinion from this Court addressing the HHA Program 
would be advisory, as the administrative record is not 
before this Court, and significant recent events have 
called into question the Secretary’s approval of the 
HHA Program. The judgments below should be af-
firmed.

The Secretary’s failure to consider how approval of 
the demonstration projects would affect health cover-
age for Medicaid recipients renders the approvals ar-
bitrary and capricious. The disproportionate rates that 
the Impacted Groups, and in particular women of 
color, rely on Medicaid for health coverage makes 
these approvals particularly harmful for these commu-
nities. The decision below should be affirmed.

The
Secretary
of
HHS’s
approvals
of
the
Arkansas and New Hampshire waiver programs were
arbitrary and capricious. If allowed to go forward,
these programs would deliver a crushing blow to low-
income adults in Arkansas and New Hampshire,
leaving
tens
of
thousands

care

Medicaid program, Amici respectfully request that
this Court affirm the District of Columbia Circuit’s
judgments. In the alternative, Amici request that this
Court grant the Federal Petitioners’ motion to vacate
the judgments below and remand with instructions
that the approvals be remanded to HHS.

The district court committed an error at the very 
least in their commanded remedy. The district court 
was asked to prevent the President of the United 
States from using anything other than the total 
population of the United States to apportion 
congressional 
seats. 
The 
Congressional 
apportionment occurs at the second step of the 
census reporting statute, and the district court’s 
order did not properly assess the first step of the 
process.  
 
The district court improperly prevented the 
Secretary from even reporting information to the 
President at step one. Regardless of how this Court 
decides the merits of the case at step two, this Court 
should never prevent the Secretary of Commerce 
from reporting the number of U.S. citizens living in 
the United States and the number of those persons 
residing in the United States without authorization. 
This information is critically important, especially 
for legislatures as they embark on their sovereign 
function of drawing districts for the following 
decade.

Foreign nationals cannot be counted for purposes 
of the decennial reapportionment of seats in the 
 
13 Section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require 
a different result.  As noted above, the Framers of that 
amendment stripped away the text dealing with unfree 
persons, but otherwise left the Apportionment Clause’s 
original language and purpose intact.  It cannot be, how-
ever, that the “uppermost principle” of the delegates to the 
Constitutional Convention, “that, no matter where he 
lived, each voter should have a voice equal to that of every 
other in electing members of Congress,” Wesberry, 376 U.S. 
at 10, should be undermined by a provision that, on its 
face, guarantees that very right.
