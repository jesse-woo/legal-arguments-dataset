By design, Nebraska’s HHA Program, like the New 
Hampshire and Arkansas work requirements pro-
grams, removes coverage of important benefits con-
trary to the purposes of Medicaid. Additionally, an 
opinion from this Court addressing the HHA Program 
would be advisory, as the administrative record is not 
before this Court, and significant recent events have 
called into question the Secretary’s approval of the 
HHA Program. The judgments below should be af-

The
Secretary
of
HHS’s

arbitrary and capricious. If allowed to go forward,
these programs would deliver a crushing blow to low-

leaving
tens

coverage. As that result flouts the objectives of the
Medicaid program, Amici respectfully request that
this Court affirm the District of Columbia Circuit’s
judgments. In the alternative, Amici request that this
Court grant the Federal Petitioners’ motion to vacate
the judgments below and remand with instructions
that the approvals be remanded to HHS.

The devastation of the Bayou Corne sinkhole is 
apparent, and the resulting litigation up to this point 
has been staggering. While substantial in volume, the 
facts of this case are not overly complex. Considering 
the totality of the evidence, the Court finds that the 
Oxy entities, the Texas Brine entities, and Vulcan are 
each allocated a portion of responsibility for the 
damages occasioned by the Bayou Corne sinkhole 
under Civil Code Articles 2315 and 2317.1. 
Although all internal data from the OG3 cavern 
indicated current stability when Vulcan sold their 
interests to OxyChem, Vulcan’s negligence in failing 
to facilitate recommended studies to further define 
the edge of the Salt Dome before doubling production, 
which moved the cavern closer to the edge",,,,yc4152

The district court committed an error at the very 
least in their commanded remedy. The district court 
was asked to prevent the President of the United 
States from using anything other than the total 
population of the United States to apportion 
congressional 
seats. 
The 
Congressional 
apportionment occurs at the second step of the 
census reporting statute, and the district court’s 
order did not properly assess the first step of the 
process.  
 
The district court improperly prevented the 
Secretary from even reporting information to the 
President at step one. Regardless of how this Court 
decides the merits of the case at step two, this Court 
should never prevent the Secretary of Commerce 
from reporting the number of U.S. citizens living in 
the United States and the number of those persons 
residing in the United States without authorization. 
This information is critically important, especially 
for legislatures as they embark on their sovereign 
function of drawing districts for the following 
decade.
