ARGUMENT .............................................................. 7 
I. 
INVALIDATING THE ENTIRETY OF 
THE ACA WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC 
TO 
THE 
WELFARE 
OF 
MEMBER 
PLANS AND THEIR ENROLLEES. ................ 7 
A.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
advance 
premium 
tax 
credit 
will 
cause 
millions, including many of Member 
Plans’ enrollees, to lose coverage. ............... 9 
B.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
coverage 
requirements for persons with pre-
existing conditions puts the healthcare 
of the nation’s most vulnerable at risk. .... 12 
C.  Invalidating 
the 
ACA’s 
Medicaid 
expansion would strip health coverage 
away from those who cannot afford 
commercial insurance. .............................. 16 
D.  Invalidating the ACA will strain the 
Medicare 
budget 
and 
set 
back 
initiatives to enhance the quality of 
healthcare for older Americans. ............... 21

HEALTHCARE 
MADE 
POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE ACA IS A CRUCIAL 
PUBLIC GOOD, ESPECIALLY DURING

Over the course of a decade, the ACA has 
fundamentally reshaped the nation’s health care 
system.  Congress in 2017 chose not to disturb that 
paradigm shift—including the promise of affordable 
coverage for those with preexisting conditions—when 
defanging the individual mandate without repealing 
any other part of the ACA.

this Court wield an axe in responding to Congress’s

The ACA is a landmark law that has 
transformed the lives of millions of Americans. Among 
its many benefits, the ACA increases access to health 
care for tens of millions of people, protects consumers 
against 
discrimination 
based 
on 
preexisting 
conditions and age, increases the financial stability of 
the Medicare program, and protects older adults from 
abuse and neglect. And, as the pandemic has shown, 
the law is a stabilizing force that helps steady the 
country in times of crisis. 
 
Ten years in, the ACA is woven into the fabric 
of our economy and our lives. A decision invalidating 
the law would be a nationwide catastrophe for the 
health and financial stability of all Americans, but 
especially for older adults. It would also be unjust, as 
the minimum coverage provision is constitutional.  
Even if the Court finds that the minimum coverage 
provision is unconstitutional, the rest of the ACA 
should stand. Many provisions, such as those providing 
cost-savings to Medicare beneficiaries, are wholly 
unrelated to the mandate. Most importantly, Congress 
did, in fact, leave the rest of the law standing, and the 
ACA continues to operate as Congress intended.   
 
Simply put, the ACA is benefitting millions of 
people, the health care system, and the national 
economy and should remain in force.",,,,yq2340

In United States v. Darby, 312 U.S. 100, 124 
(1941), this Court said the Tenth Amendment ""states 
but a truism that all is retained which has not been 
surrendered."" 
 True, the Tenth Amendment 
merely sets in concrete what the Founders always 
assumed was correct.  But as Thomas Jefferson 
wrote,

stated the First Amendment Burdens Pre-
sented by the Loan-Repayment Limit ........

relied on a material error ....................

strated Anti-Corruption Interests that the
