THE NINTH CIRCUIT ERRED BECAUSE ITS 
FINDINGS OF DISCRIMINATORY RESULTS 
UNDER SECTION 2 OF THE VRA WERE NOT 
SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE THAT THE 
CHALLENGED VOTING PROCEDURES  
CAUSED RACIAL MINORITIES TO HAVE  
LESS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN  
THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND TO ELECT 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR CHOICE ............. 6 
 
I. 
Courts Have Used a Two-Step Framework 
That Includes a Causation Requirement in 
Analyzing Whether a Section 2 Results  
Claim Has Been Proven. .................................. 6

There Are Substantial Conflicts Within

IV. 
Respondents Failed to Prove That  
Arizona’s H.B. 2023 Procedure That

Like the poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim 
Crow era, modern voter suppression efforts are relent-
less and effective. H.B. 2023 is one such effort, adopted 
in Arizona based on demonstrably false claims of voter 
fraud for the specific purpose of stopping a practice 
used predominately in minority communities. See 
DNC, 948 F.3d at 1037 (“[I]f some Arizonans today dis-
trust third-party ballot collection, it is because of the 
fraudulent campaign mounted by proponents of H.B. 
2023. . . . To the degree that there has been any fraud, 
it has been the false and race-based claims of the pro-
ponents of H.B. 2023”). This Court should affirm the 
Ninth Circuit’s en banc opinion.
