The decisions made about local TV license owner-
ship will impact our democracy forever. 
The Court should consider what could happen if 
in a single town, just one purveyor of news controlled 
the local TV stations and the local newspaper. What 
could possibly go wrong? 
The Court should further consider everything the 
Federal Communications Commission ignored or refused 
to consider in its rulemaking. Democracy and our 
citizenry deserve more diverse views and local input 
on our airwaves, not less, more ownership access by 
women and minorities, not less. The consolidation 
rules the FCC has been crafting in consultation with 
corporations for years denies all Americans of what is 
our birthright–free speech for all, not just some–on

The en banc Ninth Circuit began its otherwise flawed
opinion by stating that “[t]he right to vote is the foundation
of our democracy.”  Pet. App. 1.  Precisely because the
right to vote is so important, States must be able to ensure
that elections are orderly and secure, and that fraud does
not diminish legitimate votes.  The decision below threatens
States’ ability to discharge their duty based on an
interpretation of Section 2 and the Fifteenth Amendment

With an increase in vote-denial claims—though 
without evidence of actual vote denial, at least not if 
judged by racial disparities in voting and overall 
turnout rates—this Court should set out a clear 
interpretive method that courts can follow nationwide. 
Without that basic framework, any change in voting 
rules can draw a legal challenge and might be upheld 
one year only to be struck down based on new data the 
next. However the Court rules on the two Arizona laws 
at issue here, it must lay out a clear jurisprudential 
framework for evaluating Section 2 claims, free of 
balancing tests and other subjective standards that 
are grist for result-oriented and public-confidence-
destroying judging.

SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ..................................... 3 
 
ARGUMENT ............................................................... 6 
 
THE NINTH CIRCUIT ERRED BECAUSE ITS 
FINDINGS OF DISCRIMINATORY RESULTS 
UNDER SECTION 2 OF THE VRA WERE NOT 
SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE THAT THE 
CHALLENGED VOTING PROCEDURES  
CAUSED RACIAL MINORITIES TO HAVE  
LESS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN  
THE POLITICAL PROCESS AND TO ELECT 
REPRESENTATIVES OF THEIR CHOICE ............. 6 
 
I. 
Courts Have Used a Two-Step Framework 
That Includes a Causation Requirement in 
Analyzing Whether a Section 2 Results  
Claim Has Been Proven. .................................. 6 
 
II. 
There Are Substantial Conflicts Within  
and Among the Circuits Regarding the 
Appropriate Way to Determine Whether  
the Causation Requirement of Step One Has 
Been Satisfied ................................................... 9 
 
 
ii   
III. 
Respondents Failed to Prove That  
Arizona’s Out-of-Precinct Rule Caused 
Minority Voters to Have Less  
Opportunity to Participate in the  
Political Process and to Elect  
Representatives of Their Choice. ................... 20 
 
IV. 
Respondents Failed to Prove That  
Arizona’s H.B. 2023 Procedure That  
Restricts Ballot Collection and Delivery  
By Third Parties Caused Minority Voters  
To Have Less Opportunity to Participate  
in the Political Process and to Elect 
Representatives of Their Choice. ................... 25

I. VRA §2’s text, structure, and legislative

statute 
aimed 
at 
invalidating neutral time, place, and manner

II. Adopting the Ninth Circuit’s erroneous VRA 
§2 interpretation would jeopardize countless
