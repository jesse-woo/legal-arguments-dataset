This fervent support for a particular candidate has rendered these groups more inclined toward \"violent action aimed at dominating public space around [] election[s].\" Id. at 2. A study tracking over 80 such  militias found that while many were \"laten t\" (in that they \"threaten[ed] more violence than they commit[ted]\") , many were not. Id. at 7. In one instance, members of the \"Michigan Wolverine Watchman militia,\" were arrested in connection with an attempt, in the runup to the 2020 election, to kidna p and perhaps assassinate Michigan's Governor.  See id . at 21.  These o rganized groups do not hide their violent objectives . A former FBI counterintelligence specialist commented that many of these militia groups use \"the language of violent conflict in bo th their public and in their private communications online .\" Brentin Mock, How Voter Intimidation Could Get Uglier , Bloomberg (Oct. 7, 2020), https://bloom.bg/3fM8uZl . They are \"calling for a physical response and presence to polling places,\" such that \"the specter of people who are violent in nature and have violent agendas and often come armed with guns is . . . a very real possibility.\"  Id. To take one example, the lead er of one such militia said the following at a rally, on the subject of his perceived political opponents: \"We're going to make these people fear us again. We should have been shooting a long time ago instead of standing off to the 24  side.\" Mike Giglio, A Pro-Trump Militant Group has Recruited Thousands of Police, Soldiers, and Veterans , The Atlantic (Nov. 2020), https://bit.ly/2VLEDcB .\n"

      "The plaintiffs largely ignore the generally applicable tortlaw principles on which the petitioners' argument rests. They instead home in on the relative-ly few statelaw cases specifically addressing whether product manufacturers can be held liable for later added asbestos. They say an \"overwhelming majority\" of these cases support their rule in the asbestos context specifically. Resps. Br. 41. That would be irrelevant if it were true, and it is false. The many cases addressing foundational tortlaw principles deserve far more weight than the few cases addressing the existence of an asbestosspecific exception. Of the many tens of thousands of asbestos cases filed over the years, only a tiny percentage address whether manufacturers are liable for later added asbestos. Almost all of these cases were decided in recent years, because asbestos litigators began targeting such manufacturers only when companies in the asbestos's chain of distribution went bankrupt.  See Amicus Br. of Coalition for Litigation Justice, Inc., et al., 5 –6. The small number of these cases 13  suggests that the \"overwhelming majority\" is really a minority of courts deviating from traditional principles.  Regardless, there is no \"overwhelming majority.\"  Resps. Br. 41. The plaintiffs identify only two high court decisions embracing their rule. See May v. Air & Liquid Sys. Corp. , 129 A.3d 984, 1000 (Md. 2015); Dummitt , 59 N.E.3d at 471. They cite one other state supreme court decision, but it addresses a distinct issue and in dicta embraces the petitioners' rule.  Macias v. Saberhagen Holdings, Inc. , 282 P.3d 1069, 1076 (Wash. 2012) (en banc) (no liability for manufacturers of equipment \"encased in asbestos insulating materials that the Navy applied to the equipment on its ships\"). The remaining \"overwhelming\" support consists of a decision from Oregon's intermediate appellate court (the plaintiffs mislabel it an Oregon Supreme Court case) and several triallevel decisions, including unpublished, non- precedential decisions from commonpleas courts. Resps. Br. 41 – 42. In addition to overstating their support, the plaintiffs ignore contrary state authority. They never dis-close that Maine has adopted the petitioners' rule.  Grant v. Foster Wheeler, LLC , 140 A.3d 1242, 1248 – 49 (Me. 2016) (cited in Petrs. Br. 29, 31). That opin-ion alone would make the division among state high courts twoto-one. And if lowercourt decisions count, the split is further diluted. See, e.g. , Thurmon v. Ga. Pac., LLC , 650 F. App'x 752, 757, 761 (11th Cir. 2016) (applying Georgia law); Morgan v . Bill Vann Co., 969 F. Supp. 2d 1358, 1367 (S.D. Ala. 2013) (Alabama law); Faddish v. Buffalo Pumps , 881 F. Supp. 2d 1361, 1369 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (Florida law); Gilbert v. 14  Advance Auto Parts, 2018 WL 3521971, at 13 (Pa. Super. Ct. July 23, 2018).  So the s tate courts (and courts applying state law) are, at most, closely divided. And in fact, the split is threeto-two in favor of the petitioners. The California and Washington Supreme Courts have held that manufacturers are not liable for lateradded asbestos-containing parts and insulation. O'Neil , 266 P .3d at 995, 997 –98; Braaten , 198 P.3d at 495– 96. Both decisions are still good law. Contra Resps. Br. 44.  The plaintiffs downplay these cases because they re-served the question whether the same rule woul d apply in \"the case of a product that required the use of a defective part in order to operate.\" O'Neil , 266 P.3d at 996 n.6; accord Braaten , 198 P.3d at 495 –96.  But the courts left that issue undecided because it was not before them; they did not adopt an exception by declining to consider whether one existed. Indeed, O'Neil noted that, in cases involving \"required\" parts, \"the policy rationales against imposing liabil-ity on a manufacturer for a defective part it did not produce or supply would remain.\"  266 P .3d at 996 n.6. In sum, the split favors the petitioners, and would be far from \"overwhelming\" even if it didn't.\n"

      "The appointments here and the Board's exercise of its powers notwithstandin g an Appointments Clause challenge were plainly reasonable and in good faith.  Aurelius (Br. 62) and UTIER (Br. 75-79) argue that the de facto officer doctrine is inappl icable here because the nature of the appointments was questioned, first by a few Senators and then by Aurelius and UTIER. But there is no legal basis for giving two Senators or litigants an effective veto on the actions of officials simply by raising an Appointments Clause issue. Moreover, there was certainly, at the very least, a strong legal basis for the Board to believ e it was properly appointed given the breadth of the Territories Clause and the district court ruling affirmin g the validity of the appointments. This Court has reco gnized that such a strong basis, even if ultimately rejected, suffices for good faith and for officials to enforce a statute even if there is a cloud of constitutional uncertainty over the statute. See Lemon , 411 U.S. at 207 (plurality opinion) (\"That there would be constitutional attack on Act 109 was plain from the outset. But this is not a case where it could be said that appellees acted in bad faith or that they relied on a plainly unlawful statute. In this case, even the clarity of hindsigh t is not persuasive that the constitutional resolution of Lemon I could be predicted with assurance sufficient to undermine appellees' reli-ance on Act 109.\").  43 Indeed, the implication of Aurelius's argument is that the Board should have sat on its hands and  done nothing for years until the Appointments Clause litigation was finally resolved. But this would have upended the presumption of constitutionality favoring all laws. It also would have been nonsensical, in clear conflict with PROMESA (which required prompt action by the Board), and extraordinarily detrimental to all stakeholders in the Puerto Rico economic and humanitarian crisis. And as Lemon explained, such an approach would improperly undermine the initiative of the political branches. 411 U.S. at 207-08 (plurality opinion) (\"Appellants would have state offi-cials stay their hands until newly enacted state programs are 'ratified' by the federal courts, or risk draconian, retrospective decrees should the legislation fall. In our view, appellant s' position could seriously undermine the initiative of state legislators and executive officials alike.\"). Accordingly, Aurelius and UTIER's contention that every party in every Title III proceeding should have acted on a presumption of unconstitutionality based s olely on their arguments should be rejected. 12 12 Amici raise two additional arguments against application of the de facto officer doctrine not advanced by the parties, but both are meritless.  First, amicus Pacific Legal Foundation argues (Br. 4-8) that the de facto officer doctrine is inapplicable where the office itself is invalid. But he re, there is no question that the office of the Oversight Board is legal, and that it could be filled if the members were appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. Thus, the office is valid. Second, amicus Washington Legal Foundation argues (Br. 9-12) that the Board members lack Article III standing, but there is no legal basis to say that Board members lack standing to defend their own appointment. The Washington Legal Foundat ion cites cases concerning whether an officer can appear on behalf of the United States,  44\n"

Yet the Delaware Constitution's par tisan selection provisions may actually undermine these interests . First, assigning judgeships to members of a particular political party announces to the public that the legal system views judicial decisions as heavily influenced by party affiliation. Second, the partisan balancing requirement could increase partisanship, by le ading judges to feel some obligation to represent the \"Democratic\" or \"Republican\" seats they hold. And, third, the requirement would preclude the appointment of the many independents who are ideologically centrist, and thus are more likely to be non parti san.  12 Of course, we speak here of the cons titutional mandate as to government action; when it comes to private action, Congress has chosen not to ban political- affiliation discrimination, even where it has banned religious discrimination.  13  Moreover, political balance can be potentially helpful only on the Delaware Supreme Court, in which the judges deliberate together . See Pet'r Br. 40–41 (discussing \"panel effects\"). But the twoparty requirement also applies to the Court of Chancery and Superior Court , though the judges there hear cases individually. \"[P]artisan balance  says little about the impartiality of individual members [of a court ]\" who are deciding cases by themselves.

      "The common law has long considered the \"knowledge element … critical\" to aiding-and-abetting liability, Camp v.

The text of Section 2333 and Halberstam give effect to that principle by requiring that a defendant know she was providing the particular substantial assistance at issue. Adherence to that requirement is especially important where (as here) a defendant is ac-cused of merely failing to prevent misuse of its widely available, ordinary services. That means, at a mini37  mum, that Defendants must have known both of specific accounts that substantially assisted the Reina attack and that not blocking those accounts would substantially assist such an attack. The Ninth Circuit, however, effectively transformed the statute's knowledge requirement into something akin to recklessness or negli-gence—requiring only general awareness that ISIS adherents were among the billions using Defendants' services, notwithstanding that Defendants prohibited and regularly removed terrorist accounts and posts. Under the correct knowledge standard, Plaintiffs could not satisfy even the first part of that require-ment— i.e., alleging that Defendants knew of and failed to block specific accounts used by ISIS that substantial-ly assisted the Reina attack. Indeed, Plaintiffs concede that Defendants \"rarely knew about 'specific' terrorist accounts or posts\" at all, Opp. 17, and do not allege that Defendants knew about, yet failed to block, any account or post that was used to pl an or commit any terrorist attack. The Amended Complaint would thus fall short even if, as the Ninth Circuit incorrectly held, see supra Part I, the \"act of international terrorism\" that must have been substantially assisted is ISIS's general terrorism enterprise.\n",

      "The consideration of discriminatory practices in electoral history must necessarily be limited in temporal scope and cannot be too disconnected from current conditions given the history of race in this country. Indeed, if one were to look far enough back in nearly any jurisdiction, such effort would undoubtedly yield examples of pervasive discriminatory practices. But surely not every jurisdiction will possess unconstitutionally discriminatory election laws today . Consistent with this principle, courts have temporally circumscribed the scope of VRA analyses. In Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One v. Holder , this Court noted that Section 5 of the VRA raised federali sm concerns due to the scope of its historical an alysis. 557 U.S. 193, 203-206 (2009). Specifically, the Court stated that the VRA \"imposes current burdens [on states] and must be justified by current needs ,\" concluding that \"a departure from the fundam ental principle of equal sovereignty requires a showing that a statute's disparate geographic coverage is sufficiently related to the problem that it targets.\" Id. at 203 (emphasis added). Furthermore, the Court stated that Section 5 was troubling because it differentiated between states in ways that may no longer have been justified. Id. at 203-204. Ultimately, however, this Court invoked the canon of constitutional avoidance and did not rule on the constitutionality of Section 5. Id. at 206. 6 In the seminal case Shelby County v. Holder , this Court invalidated the preclearance requirements of Section 4 of the VRA due to its historical relevance. 570 U.S. 529, 557 (2013). Specifically, the Court so ruled because the preclearance requirements were no longer justified by the same concerns that were relevant a halfcentury earlier, when the VRA was passed. Id. The preclearance coverage formula of Section 4 was \"based on decades-old data and eradicated practices.\" Id. at 551. The Court held that the Fifteenth Amendment \"is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future,\" and if the VRA is to govern the states, it must do so \"on a basis that makes sense in light of current conditions. It cannot rely simply on the past .\" Id. at 553 (emphasis added). This is especially true in circumstances where the VRA \"authorizes federal intrusion into sensitive areas of state and local policymaking.\" Id. at 545 (quoting Lopez v. Monterey Cty., 525 U.S. 266, 282 (1999)). These circumstances are clearly present in the case at hand. The rationale of Northwest Austin and Shelby County, that current burdens imposed on states must be justified by current needs or conditions, applies across VRA and constitutional analyses. See, e.g., Veasey v. Abbott , 830 F.3d 216, 328 (5th Cir. 2016) (Elrod, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (applying the \"current needs\" reasoning of Northwest Austin to a Section 2 VRA claim), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 612 (2017); Smith v. School Bd. of Concordia Par. , 906 F.3d 327, 338 (5th Cir. 2018) (Ho, J., concurring) (applying Shelby County 's \"current conditions\" rationale to challenge a racial balancing consent decree); United States v. Cannon , 7 750 F.3d 492, 510-11 (5th Cir. 2014) (Elrod, J., concurring) (applying the \"current conditions\" reasoning of Shelby County and Northwest Austin to a Thirteenth Amendment claim), cert. denied, 574 U.S. 1029 (2014); Mance v. Sessions , 896 F.3d 699, 706 (5th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (observing that, in a Second Amendment case, \"current burdens on constitutional rights 'must be justified by current needs'\") (quoting Shelby Cty ., 570 U.S. at 536); Mayhew v. Burwell , 772 F.3d 80, 96-97 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that a statute requiring a state to maintain Medicaid coverage of low-income 19- and 20-year-olds for nine years did not violate the spending clause, U.S. Const. Art. I, § 8, Cl. 1, because in part it was sufficiently justified by \"current conditions\" under Shelby County ) (quoting Shelby Cty ., 570 U.S. at 553), cert. denied, 576 U.S. 1004 (2015). Consistent with Shelby County and its progeny, examination of discriminatory practices in electoral history under Section 2 must be reasonably limited to examining the current conditions of a particular state, rather than punishing a state for its distant past – including actions taken before becoming a state. In other words, the examination must be of recent history, relevant to the law or regulation in question. Undertaking an unlimited examination of past wrongs reaching back to before statehood, without balanced consideration of modern electoral advances, deprives states and municipalities of the ability to move on from the errors of previous generations. Failing to limit the examination, as the en banc Ninth Circuit did in the present case, casts a shadow over nearly all election laws in nearly all states, especially if this Court 8 grants credence to the opinion. Casting aside reasonable, neutral, and justified election administration efforts threatens the very core of democracy. Such \"inflammatory and unsupportable charges of racist motivation poison the political atmosphere.\" Veasey , 830 F.3d at 281-82 (Jones, J., dissenting).\n",

      "As explained above, ANILCA defines public land in terms of what the federal government owns. Unless \"title\" to the land is held by the United States, it is simply not \"public land\" for purposes of ANILCA. 16 U.S.C. § 3102(3). The Ninth Circuit conceded that Alaska holds title to the submerged lands under navigable waters such as the Nation River. See Pet.App.9a-10a. The court also acknowledged that the United States does not hold title to the waters themselves; in fact, it asserted that \"[w]ater cannot be owned\" at all. Pet.App.17a 4. F or these reasons, the Ninth Circuit's application of its Katie John subsistence decisions, see Katie John I , 72 F.3d 698; Katie John II , 247 F.3d 1032; Katie John III , 720 F.3d 1214, had at least some foothold in the statute. The Court need not overturn or otherwise address the issue of subsistence management regulation in Alaska in order to rule in favor of Mr. Sturgeon. Title VIII supports an array of subsistence management regulations that are beyond the scope of Mr. Sturgeon's challenge. The focus of Mr. Sturgeon's challenge is instead the Ninth Circuit's decision to expand the reasoning of the Katie John cases beyond subsistence and, in so doing, grant NPS plenary control over State waterways. 35 The Ninth Circuit nonetheless concluded that the \"reserved water rights\" doctrine gave rise to an implied federal interest in navigable waters within CSUs that was sufficient to uphold NPS's regulatory authority over those waters. See Pet.App.12a (considering whether \"a federally reserved water right is implicit in a federal reservation of public land\"); Pet.App.19a (\"[T]he United States has an implied reservation of water rights, rendering the river public lands.\"). Under the reserved water rights doctrine, \"when the Federal government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the Government, by implication, reserves appurtenant water then unappropriated to the extent needed to accomplish the purpose of the reservation.\" Cappaert , 426 U.S. at 138. An intent to reserve such water \"is inferred if the previously unappropriated waters are necessary to accomplish the purposes for which the reservation was created.\" Id. at 139. Even if that doctrine applied to the Nation River in certain circumstances, it cannot transform the River into \"public land\" for purposes of Section 103(c), nor can it be used to justify NPS's hovercraft ban, for several independent reasons.\n",

      "Wyoming does not dispute that this Court ordinarily \"avoid[s] the unnecessary resolution of constitutional questions.\" Nw. Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder , 557 U.S. 193, 197 (2009). Nor does it contest that to apply issue preclusion here, the Court would have to resolve two questions with constitutional implications—first, whether an Indian is in \"privity\" with his tribe for issue preclusion purposes; and second, whether a state can apply offensive preclusion against a criminal defendant using a prior civil judgment. Pet.Br.54-57. Wyoming simply asks this Court to decide those questions in its 24 favor. Its truncated argume nts, however, only confirm the wisdom of avoidance here. For example, Wyoming has no response to this Court's cases questioning if not rejecting offensive issue preclusion against criminal defendants. See Simpson v. Florida , 403 U.S. 384 (1971); Currier v. Virginia , 138 S. Ct. 2144, 2152 (2018) (plurality op.).  And Wyoming identifies no decision—ever— permitting offensive issue preclusion against a criminal defendant based on a prior civil judgment (and after the state failed to raise preclusion during the criminal trial, no less). Furthermore, Wyoming's argument turns on state la w, Resp.Br.35, suggesting that any rule this Court mi ght articulate would vary across multiple jurisdictions, generating confusion and uncertainty. Similarly, Wyoming identifies no federal case holding that an Indian is in privity with his tribe for preclusion purposes. Wyoming insists that, categorically, tribal members are bound by judgments involving \"sovereign\" tribes, Resp.Br.2425, but that sweeping assertion is inconsistent with this Court's admonition that nonparties may be bound by prior judgments only in \"limited circumstances,\" Taylor v. Sturgell , 553 U.S. 880, 894 (2008). At bottom, these far-reaching issues are best resolved in another case—at a minimum, one where preclusion was argued from the outset. They provide no basis for affirming the conviction of a man who exercised a federal treaty right in order to feed his three daughters, and for de claring that 150-year-old treaty right gone forever. 25\n",

      "The Second Circuit asserted that none of these concerns are implicated here because the subpoena \" is directed not to the President, but to his accountants .\" App. 20a. But neither lower court denied that the  President is a target of the grand jury. There is a good reason why. He is obviously a target. See, e.g. , App. 22a (explaining \"that the grand jury is investigating not only the President, but also other persons and entities \"); App. 117a20a (naming the President and seeking his personal records). The most the Second Circuit would say is that \"it is unclear whether the President will be indicted.\" App. 22a. Similarly, t he district court was only willing to say that the grand  jury \"may or may n ot ultimately target [i.e., indict] the  President.\" App. 53a. Even in this Court, the District Attorney concedes that the basis for the investigation is the President's alleged conduct, BIO 25, that the 35 President is \"a subject of the investigation,\" BIO 1 2, that the \"investigation extends beyond Petitioner,\" and that \"it is unclear whether the President will be indicted,\" BIO 26 (emphasis added).4 Nor did the lower courts contest the President's right to challenge the Mazars subpoena in federal court —even though it was issued to his accounting firm. As the Second Circuit explained, the \"President has standing to challenge the Mazars subpoena.\" App.  20a n.15. A subpoena to a custodian is the functional equivalent of a subpoena to the investigation's target . See Eastland v. U.S. Servicemen's Fund , 421 U.S. 491, 501 n.14 (1975); accord Mazars , 940 F.3d at 752 (Rao, J. dissenting) (noting the majority di d not \"question President Trump's standing\") . There is no dispute , then, that the President is entitled to bring this suit to challenge a criminal subpoena for his records that arises from a state proceeding threaten ing him with criminal prosecution. The Second Circuit's reliance on the ostensibl e thirdparty character of this subpoena is an attempt to draw a narrow distinction. In the court's view, 4 The District Attorney did not dispute the assertion in the petition for certiorari that the subpoena was issued \"for the express purpose of deciding whether to indict him for state crimes\" and \"as part of a grandjury proceeding that seeks to determine whether the President committed statelaw crimes.\"  Pet. 2, 4. His \"failure to contest these factual assertions at the certiorari stage waived [the] right to do so at the merits stage.\" District of Columbia v. Wesby , 138 S. Ct. 577, 584, n.1 (2018) (discussing S. Ct. R. 15.2).  36 immunity is u nwarranted because Mazars —not the President —will bear the burden of compliance with the subpoena. \" Although the subpoena is directed to the President's custodian, \" the Second Circuit noted,  \"no court has ordered the President to do or produce anything. \" App. 21a; see App. 20a (\" compliance does not require the President to do anything at all \"). But the Second Circui t's reasoning is flawed at each step  of the analysis .  Most importantly, the Second Circuit asked the wrong question. When it comes to absolute immunity, the issue is not whether only this particular subpoena will excessively burden the President. This Court always takes a categorical approach to presidential immunity.  Take Fitzgerald , for example . This Court did not inquire whether Mr. Fitzgerald's suit alone \"would raise unique risks to the effective functioning of government.\" 457 U.S. at 751. It recognized that \"the President would be an easily identifiable target for suits for civil damages\" and that, collectively , those civil suits \"could distract a President from his public duties, to the detriment of not only the President and his office but also the Nation that the Presidency was designed to serve.\" Id. at 753. Likewise, in Clinton , the Court did not examine  whether the suit brought by Ms. Jones would —in and of itself —\"create[] 'serious risks for the institution of the Presidency. '\" 520 U.S. at 689. It surveyed the \"200 year history of the Republic\" and then asked whether \"this particular case —as well as the potential 37 additional litigation that an affirmance of the Court of Appeals judgment might spawn —may impose an unacceptable burden on the … office.\" Id. at 70102 (emphasis added). There is no justification for framing a narrower inquiry. \"The issue is one of precedents and slippery slopes: we must ask not merely what would happen if [this subpoena] goes forth but what would happen if [others] can go forth and multiply.\" Amar & Katyal  714 n.52. And it is especially \"perilous\" to predict \"whether a particular criminal prosecution\" would \"impede the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions.\" Moss Memo 254. That is why \"a categorical rule … is most consistent with the constitutional structure, rather than a doctrinal test that would require the court to assess whether a particular criminal proceeding is likely to impose serious burdens upon the President.\" Id. As explained above, allowing every state and local prosecutor across the country to target th e President in this way will burden him, distract him, and degrade  his ability to execute the manifold duties of his office.  See supra 23-26.  Regardless, the Second Circuit miscalculated  the burden of compl ying with this subpoena. Whether the subpoena was issued to his accountants or to him , the President himself would never personally undertake the laborious task of compiling, indexing, and producing responsive documents. That is not a basis for denying immunity. Fitzgerald would have come out the other way if it were . There too, t he former President was not going to shoulder burdens of 38 physical compliance . He would have had no more day to-day involvement in that civil dispute than the President will have in this criminal proceedi ng.  The distractions and mental burdens are what matter. Those impositions arise from the fact that he is a target of the grandjury investigation and that his records are the subject of the criminal subpoena . As a target of a grandjury proceeding, th e President must consult with his attorneys, consider the need to assert  available privilege s,5 and otherwise participate in his defense. The idea that any subject of criminal process will—or should —simply ignore it and go about his or her business is unreasonable . At the end of the day, \"a President who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as President.\" Kavanaugh, 93 Minn. L. Rev. at 1461. The Second Ci rcuit and District Attorney also exaggerated the scope of relief sought. This is neither  an effort to \"shield ... third parties from investigation\" nor stop the \"grand jury [from] continuing to gather evidence throughout the period of any presidential immu nity from indictment.\" BIO 910 (citations omitted). Petitioners sought to enjoin the subpoena because it is directed at the President . The grand jury can otherwise continue its work and gather evidence 5 Some clientaccountant communications, for example, may be cond ucted at the direction or assistance of attorneys and therefore fall within attorneyclient and workproduct privileges. See, e.g. , United States v. Kovel 296 F. 2d 918 (2d Cir. 1961) (Friendly, J.).  39 as it sees fit . But issuing compulsory criminal process to the sitting President, when accompanied by threat of indictment, crosses a constitutional line. To be certain, the temporary immunity that the President enjoys makes the grand jury's work harder.  But that concern must yield given \"the overwhelming cost and substantial interference with the functioning of an entire branch of government \" that embroiling the President in a state grandjury proceeding would entail. Moss Memo 257; see also Fitzgerald , 457 U.S. at 749-53. It is the byproduct of having a system where the Chief Executive is the \"sole indispensable man in government.\" Clinton , 520 U.S. at 713 (Breyer, J. concurring in the judgment) (citations omitted) . \"In the constitutional balance, the potential for prejudice caused by delay f ails to provide an overriding need sufficient to overcome the justification for temporary immunity from criminal prosecution. \" Moss Memo 257 (quotation omitted) .\n",

      "{'Section Text': 'The actual voting period —from the start of early voting through election day —is a critical point at which intimidation and gunrelated threats affect voters. This may occur in oneoff skirmishes as well as through organized, politically motivated group efforts.  Spontaneous political skirmish es at polling sites  are regular occurrence s. Absent firearms, c ontentious encounters are much more easily controlled . See, e.g. ,  ABC News, Fight Breaks Out at Polling Place (Nov. 8, 2016), https://bit.ly/3jMYxw6 (voters arrived to \"loud screams\" at a polling place in Florida after an argument between a voter and campaign volunteer \"escalated into a fight,\" wherein a voter charged the volunteer and the volunteer pepper sprayed the voter);  WREG Memphis, Video Shows Candidate, Campaigner in Ballot Brawl at Mississippi Polling Site (Nov. 4, 2020), https://bit.ly/3xz8Pof (a candidate and a \"rival campaign supporter\" \"got into a fist f ight\" and \"brawl\" at a Mississippi polling place). But when guns are present , whether brandished or concealed , the political fray may quickly escalate into tragedy . This is all the more true when organized groups — especially groups known for being heavily armed — congregate for the purpose of intimidating voters to either stay away or vote a certain way. For example. 23  experts have \"identified a major realignment of militia movements in the US from antifederal government writ large to mostly supporting one candidate.\"  Hampton Stall, et al., Standing By: RightWing Militia Groups & the US Election , ACLED (Oct. 2020) , at 5.  This fervent support for a particular candidate has rendered these groups more inclined toward \"violent action aimed at dominating public space around [] election[s].\" Id. at 2. A study tracking over 80 such  militias found that while many were \"laten t\" (in that they \"threaten[ed] more violence than they commit[ted]\") , many were not. Id. at 7. In one instance, members of the \"Michigan Wolverine Watchman militia,\" were arrested in connection with an attempt, in the runup to the 2020 election, to kidna p and perhaps assassinate Michigan\\'s Governor.  See id . at 21.  These o rganized groups do not hide their violent objectives . A former FBI counterintelligence specialist commented that many of these militia groups use \"the language of violent conflict in bo th their public and in their private communications online .\" Brentin Mock, How Voter Intimidation Could Get Uglier , Bloomberg (Oct. 7, 2020), https://bloom.bg/3fM8uZl . They are \"calling for a physical response and presence to polling places,\" such that \"the specter of people who are violent in nature and have violent agendas and often come armed with guns is . . . a very real possibility.\"  Id. To take one example, the lead er of one such militia said the following at a rally, on the subject of his perceived political opponents: \"We\\'re going to make these people fear us again.

      "Syllabus\n",
      "The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., grants the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as the designee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), the authority to regulate, among other items, \"drugs\" and \"devices,\" §§321(g)-(h), 393. In 1996, the FDA asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products, concluding that, under the FDCA, nicotine is a \"drug\" and cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are \"devices\" that deliver nicotine to the body. Pursuant to this authority, the FDA promulgated regulations governing tobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and adolescents. The FDA found that tobacco use is the Nation's leading cause of premature death, resulting in more than 400,000 deaths annually, and that most adult smokers begin when they are minors. The regulations therefore aim to reduce tobacco use by minors so as to substantially reduce the prevalence of addiction in future generations, and thus the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Respondents, a group of tobacco manufacturers, retailers, and advertisers, filed this suit challenging the FDA's regulations. They moved for summary judgment on the ground, inter alia, that the FDA lacked jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, that is, without manufacturer claims of therapeutic benefit. The District Court upheld the FDA's authority, but the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. The court concluded that construing the FDCA to include tobacco products would lead to several internal inconsistencies in the Act. It also found that evidence external to the FDCA-that the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it lacked jurisdiction over tobacco, that Congress has enacted several tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant of the FDA's position, and that Congress has considered and rejected many bills that would have given the agency such authority-confirms this conclusion.\n",
      "Held:  Reading the FDCA as a whole, as well as in conjunction with Congress' subsequent tobacco-specific legislation, it is plain that Congress has not given the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Pp. 8-40.\n",
      "(a)  Because this case involves an agency's construction of a statute it administers, the Court's analysis is governed by Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, under which a reviewing court must first ask whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue, id., at 842. If so, the court must give effect to Congress' unambiguously expressed intent. E.g., id., at 843. If not, the court must defer to the agency's construction of the statute so long as it is permissible. See, e.g., INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424. In determining whether Congress has specifically addressed the question at issue, the court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation. Rather, it must place the provision in context, interpreting the statute to create a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme. Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 569. In addition, the meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand. See, e.g., United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 530-531. Finally, the court must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency. Cf. MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231. Pp. 8-10.\n",
      "(b)  Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA's jurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is that any product regulated by the FDA that remains on the market must be safe and effective for its intended use. See, e.g., §393(b)(2). That is, the potential for inflicting death or physical injury must be offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit. United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 556. In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustively documented that tobacco products are unsafe, dangerous, and cause great pain and suffering from illness. These findings logically imply that, if tobacco products were \"devices\" under the FDCA, the FDA would be required to remove them from the market under the FDCA's misbranding, see, e.g., §331(a), and device classification, see, e.g., §360e(d)(2)(A), provisions. In fact, based on such provisions, the FDA itself has previously asserted that if tobacco products were within its jurisdiction, they would have to be removed from the market because it would be impossible to prove they were safe for their intended use. Congress, however, has foreclosed a ban of such products, choosing instead to create a distinct regulatory scheme focusing on the labeling and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. Its express policy is to protect commerce and the national economy while informing consumers about any adverse health effects. See 15 U.S.C. § 1331. Thus, an FDA ban would plainly contradict congressional intent. Apparently recognizing this dilemma, the FDA has concluded that tobacco products are actually \"safe\" under the FDCA because banning them would cause a greater harm to public health than leaving them on the market. But this safety determination-focusing on the relative harms caused by alternative remedial measures-is not a substitute for those required by the FDCA. Various provisions in the Act require the agency to determine that, at least for some consumers, the product's therapeutic benefits outweigh the risks of illness or serious injury. This the FDA cannot do, because tobacco products are unsafe for obtaining any therapeutic benefit. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within the FDCA's regulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit. Pp. 10-20.\n",
      "(c)  The history of tobacco-specific legislation also demonstrates that Congress has spoken directly to the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco products. Since 1965, Congress has enacted six separate statutes addressing the problem of tobacco use and human health. Those statutes, among other things, require that health warnings appear on all packaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see 15 U.S.C. § 1331 1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement of tobacco products through any electronic communication medium regulated by the Federal  Communications Commission, see §§1335, 4402(f); require the Secretary of HHS to report every three years to Congress on research findings concerning tobacco's addictive property, 42 U.S.C. § 290aa-2(b)(2); and make States' receipt of certain federal block grants contingent on their prohibiting any tobacco product manufacturer, retailer, or distributor from selling or distributing any such product to individuals under age 18, §300x-26(a)(1). This tobacco-specific legislation has created a specific regulatory scheme for addressing the problem of tobacco and health. And it was adopted against the backdrop of the FDA consistently and resolutely stating that it was without authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. In fact, Congress several times considered and rejected bills that would have given the FDA such authority. Indeed, Congress' actions in this area have evidenced a clear intent to preclude a meaningful policymaking role for any administrative agency. Further, Congress' tobacco legislation prohibits any additional regulation of tobacco product labeling with respect to tobacco's health consequences, a central aspect of regulation under the FDCA. Under these circumstances, it is evident that Congress has ratified the FDA's previous, long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Congress has created a distinct scheme for addressing the subject, and that scheme excludes any role for FDA regulation. Pp. 20-37.\n",
      "(d)  Finally, the Court's inquiry is shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the question presented. Chevron deference is premised on the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. See 467 U.S., at 844. In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to the agency's position from its inception until 1995, the FDA has now asserted jurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA contends that, were it to determine that tobacco products provide no \"reasonable assurance of safety,\" it would have the authority to ban cigarettes and smokeless tobacco entirely. It is highly unlikely that Congress would leave the determination as to whether the sale of tobacco products would be regulated, or even banned, to the FDA's discretion in so cryptic a fashion. See MCI Telecommunications, 512 U.S., at 231. Given tobacco's unique political history, as well as the breadth of the authority that the FDA has asserted, the Court is obliged to defer not to the agency's expansive construction of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to deny the FDA this power. Pp. 37-39.\n",
      "(e)  No matter how important, conspicuous, and controversial the issue, and regardless of how likely the public is to hold the Executive Branch politically accountable, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress. Courts must take care not to extend a statute's scope beyond the point where Congress indicated it would stop. E.g., United States v. Article of Drug Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U.S. 784, 800. P. 40.\n",

      "This case involves one of the most troubling public health problems facing our Nation today: the thousands of premature deaths that occur each year because of tobacco use. In 1996, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), after having expressly disavowed any such authority since its inception, asserted jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44619-45318. The FDA concluded that nicotine is a \"drug\" within the meaning of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA or Act), 52 Stat. 1040, as amended, 21 U.S.C. § 301 et seq., and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are \"combination products\" that deliver nicotine to the body. 61 Fed. Reg. 44397 (1996). Pursuant to this authority, it promulgated regulations intended to reduce tobacco consumption among children and adolescents. Id., at 44615-44618. The agency believed that, because most tobacco consumers begin their use before reaching the age of 18, curbing tobacco use by minors could substantially reduce the prevalence of addiction in future generations and thus the incidence of tobacco-related death and disease. Id., at 44398-44399.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "Regardless of how serious the problem an administrative agency seeks to address, however, it may not exercise its authority \"in a manner that is inconsistent with the administrative structure that Congress enacted into law.\" ETSI Pipeline Project v. Missouri, 484 U.S. 495, 517 (1988). And although agencies are generally entitled to deference in the interpretation of statutes that they administer, a reviewing \"court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-843 (1984). In this case, we believe that Congress has clearly precluded the FDA from asserting jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. Such authority is inconsistent with the intent that Congress has expressed in the FDCA's overall regulatory scheme and in the tobacco-specific legislation that it has enacted subsequent to the FDCA. In light of this clear intent, the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction is impermissible.\n",

      "* The FDCA grants the FDA, as the designee of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the authority to regulate, among other items, \"drugs\" and \"devices.\" See 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)-(h), 393 (1994 ed. and Supp. III). The Act defines \"drug\" to include \"articles (other than food) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\" 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C). It defines \"device,\" in part, as \"an instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, -- or other similar or related article, including any component, part, or accessory, which is -- intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\" §321(h). The Act also grants the FDA the authority to regulate so-called \"combination products,\" which \"constitute a combination of a drug, device, or biologic product.\" §353(g)(1). The FDA has construed this provision as giving it the discretion to regulate combination products as drugs, as devices, or as both. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44400 (1996).\n",

      "On August 11, 1995, the FDA published a proposed rule concerning the sale of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to children and adolescents. 60 Fed. Reg. 41314-41787. The rule, which included several restrictions on the sale, distribution, and advertisement of tobacco products, was designed to reduce the availability and attractiveness of tobacco products to young people. Id., at 41314. A public comment period followed, during which the FDA received over 700,000 submissions, more than \"at any other time in its history on any other subject.\" 61 Fed.

      "On August 28, 1996, the FDA issued a final rule entitled \"Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents.\" Id., at 44396. The FDA determined that nicotine is a \"drug\" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are \"drug delivery devices,\" and therefore it had jurisdiction under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed-that is, without manufacturer claims of therapeutic benefit. Id., at 44397, 44402. First, the FDA found that tobacco products \" 'affect the structure or any function of the body' \" because nicotine \"has significant pharmacological effects.\" Id., at 44631. Specifically, nicotine \"exerts psychoactive, or mood-altering, effects on the brain\" that cause and sustain addiction, have both tranquilizing and stimulating effects, and control weight. Id., at 44631-44632. Second, the FDA determined that these effects were \"intended\" under the FDCA because they \"are so widely known and foreseeable that [they] may be deemed to have been intended by the manufacturers,\" id., at 44687; consumers use tobacco products \"predominantly or nearly exclusively\" to obtain these effects, id., at 44807; and the statements, research, and actions of manufacturers revealed that they \"have 'designed' cigarettes to provide pharmacologically active doses of nicotine to consumers,\" id., at 44849. Finally, the agency concluded that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are \"combination products\" because, in addition to containing nicotine, they include device components that deliver a controlled amount of nicotine to the body, id., at 45208-45216.\n",

      "Having resolved the jurisdictional question, the FDA next explained the policy justifications for its regulations, detailing the deleterious health effects associated with tobacco use. It found that tobacco consumption was \"the single leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\" Id., at 44398. According to the FDA, \"[m]ore than 400,000 people die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and heart disease.\" Ibid. The agency also determined that the only way to reduce the amount of tobacco-related illness and mortality was to reduce the level of addiction, a goal that could be accomplished only by preventing children and adolescents from starting to use tobacco. Id., at 44398-44399. The FDA found that 82% of adult smokers had their first cigarette before the age of 18, and more than half had already become regular smokers by that age. Id., at 44398. It also found that children were beginning to smoke at a younger age, that the prevalence of youth smoking had recently increased, and that similar problems existed with respect to smokeless tobacco. Id., at 44398-44399. The FDA accordingly concluded that if \"the number of children and adolescents who begin tobacco use can be substantially diminished, tobacco-related illness can be correspondingly reduced because data suggest that anyone who does not begin smoking in childhood or adolescence is unlikely ever to begin.\" Id., at 44399.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Based on these findings, the FDA promulgated regulations concerning tobacco products' promotion, labeling, and accessibility to children and adolescents. See id., at 44615-44618. The access regulations prohibit the sale of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to persons younger than 18; require retailers to verify through photo identification the age of all purchasers younger than 27; prohibit the sale of cigarettes in quantities smaller than 20; prohibit the distribution of free samples; and prohibit sales through self-service displays and vending machines except in adult-only locations. Id., at 44616-44617. The promotion regulations require that any print advertising appear in a black-and-white, text-only format unless the publication in which it appears is read almost exclusively by adults; prohibit outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of any public playground or school; prohibit the distribution of any promotional items, such as T-shirts or hats, bearing the manufacturer's brand name; and prohibit a manufacturer from sponsoring any athletic, musical, artistic, or other social or cultural event using its brand name. Id., at 44617-44618. The labeling regulation requires that the statement, \"A Nicotine-Delivery Device for Persons 18 or Older,\" appear on all tobacco product packages. Id., at 44617.\n",

      "The FDA promulgated these regulations pursuant to its authority to regulate \"restricted devices.\" See 21 U.S.C. § 360j(e). The FDA construed §353(g)(1) as giving it the discretion to regulate \"combination products\" using the Act's drug authorities, device authorities, or both, depending on \"how the public health goals of the act can be best accomplished.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 44403 (1996). Given the greater flexibility in the FDCA for the regulation of devices, the FDA determined that \"the device authorities provide the most appropriate basis for regulating cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\" Id., at 44404. Under 21 U.S.C. § 360j(e), the agency may \"require that a device be restricted to sale, distribution, or use -- upon such other conditions as [the FDA] may prescribe in such regulation, if, because of its potentiality for harmful effect or the collateral measures necessary to its use, [the FDA] determines that there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.\" The FDA reasoned that its regulations fell within the authority granted by §360j(e) because they related to the sale or distribution of tobacco products and were necessary for providing a reasonable assurance of safety. 61 Fed.

See Coyne Beahm, Inc. v. FDA, 966 F. Supp. 1374 (1997). They moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the FDA lacked jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed, the regulations exceeded the FDA's authority under 21 U.S.C. § 360j(e), and the advertising restrictions violated the First Amendment.

The District Court granted respondents' motion in part and denied it in part. 966 F. Supp., at 1400. The court held that the FDCA authorizes the FDA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed and that the FDA's access and labeling regulations are permissible, but it also found that the agency's advertising and promotion restrictions exceed its authority under §360j(e). Id., at 1380-1400.

      "The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed, holding that Congress has not granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See 153 F.3d 155 (1998). Examining the FDCA as a whole, the court concluded that the FDA's regulation of tobacco products would create a number of internal inconsistencies. Id., at 162-167. Various provisions of the Act require the agency to determine that any regulated product is \"safe\" before it can be sold or allowed to remain on the market, yet the FDA found in its rulemaking proceeding that tobacco products are \"dangerous\" and \"unsafe.\" Id., at 164-167. Thus, the FDA would apparently have to ban tobacco products, a result the court found clearly contrary to congressional intent. Ibid. This apparent anomaly, the Court of Appeals concluded, demonstrates that Congress did not intend to give the FDA authority to regulate tobacco. Id., at 167. The court also found that evidence external to the FDCA confirms this conclusion. Importantly, the FDA consistently stated before 1995 that it lacked jurisdiction over tobacco, and Congress has enacted several tobacco-specific statutes fully cognizant of the FDA's position. See id., at 168-176. In fact, the court reasoned, Congress has considered and rejected many bills that would have given the agency such authority. See id., at 170-171. This, along with the absence of any intent by the enacting Congress in 1938 to subject tobacco products to regulation under the FDCA, demonstrates that Congress intended to withhold such authority from the FDA. Id., at 167-176. Having resolved the jurisdictional question against the agency, the Court of Appeals did not address whether the regulations exceed the FDA's authority under 21 U.S.C. § 360j(e) or violate the First Amendment.

      "The FDA's assertion of jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products is founded on its conclusions that nicotine is a \"drug\" and that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are \"drug delivery devices.\" Again, the FDA found that tobacco products are \"intended\" to deliver the pharmacological effects of satisfying addiction, stimulation and tranquilization, and weight control because those effects are foreseeable to any reasonable manufacturer, consumers use tobacco products to obtain those effects, and tobacco manufacturers have designed their products to produce those effects. 61 Fed. Reg. 44632-44633 (1996). As an initial matter, respondents take issue with the FDA's reading of \"intended,\" arguing that it is a term of art that refers exclusively to claims made by the manufacturer or vendor about the product. See Brief for Respondent Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. 6. That is, a product is not a drug or device under the FDCA unless the manufacturer or vendor makes some express claim concerning the product's therapeutic benefits. See id., at 6-7. We need not resolve this question, however, because assuming, arguendo, that a product can be \"intended to affect the structure or any function of the body\" absent claims of therapeutic or medical benefit, the FDA's claim to jurisdiction contravenes the clear intent of Congress.\n",

      "A threshold issue is the appropriate framework for analyzing the FDA's assertion of authority to regulate tobacco products. Because this case involves an administrative agency's construction of a statute that it administers, our analysis is governed by Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). Under Chevron, a reviewing court must first ask \"whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" Id., at 842. If Congress has done so, the inquiry is at an end; the court \"must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" Id., at 843; see also United States v. Haggar Apparel Co., 526 U.S. 380, 392 (1999); Holly Farms Corp. v. NLRB, 517 U.S. 392, 398 (1996). But if Congress has not specifically addressed the question, a reviewing court must respect the agency's construction of the statute so long as it is permissible. See INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 (1999); Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452, 457 (1997). Such deference is justified because \"[t]he responsibilities for assessing the wisdom of such policy choices and resolving the struggle between competing views of the public interest are not judicial ones,\" Chevron, supra, at 866, and because of the agency's greater familiarity with the ever-changing facts and circumstances surrounding the subjects regulated, see Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 187 (1991).\n",

      "\n",

      "In determining whether Congress has specifically addressed the question at issue, a reviewing court should not confine itself to examining a particular statutory provision in isolation. The meaning-or ambiguity-of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context. See Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994) (\"Ambiguity is a creature not of definitional possibilities but of statutory context\"). It is a \"fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.\" Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, 489 U.S. 803, 809 (1989). A court must therefore interpret the statute \"as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme,\" Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U.S. 561, 569 (1995), and \"fit, if possible, all parts into an harmonious whole,\" FTC v. Mandel Brothers, Inc., 359 U.S. 385, 389 (1959). Similarly, the meaning of one statute may be affected by other Acts, particularly where Congress has spoken subsequently and more specifically to the topic at hand. See United States v. Estate of Romani, 523 U.S. 517, 530-531 (1998); United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988). In addition, we must be guided to a degree by common sense as to the manner in which Congress is likely to delegate a policy decision of such economic and political magnitude to an administrative agency.

      "* Viewing the FDCA as a whole, it is evident that one of the Act's core objectives is to ensure that any product regulated by the FDA is \"safe\" and \"effective\" for its intended use. See 21 U.S.C. § 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) (defining the FDA's mission); More Information for Better Patient Care: Hearing before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 104th Cong., 2d Sess., 83 (1996) (statement of FDA Deputy Commissioner Schultz) (\"A fundamental precept of drug and device regulation in this country is that these products must be proven safe and effective before they can be sold\"). This essential purpose pervades the FDCA. For instance, 21 U.S.C. § 393(b)(2) (1994 ed., Supp. III) defines the FDA's \"mission\" to include \"protect[ing] the public health by ensuring that -- drugs are safe and effective\" and that \"there is reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of devices intended for human use.\" The FDCA requires premarket approval of any new drug, with some limited exceptions, and states that the FDA \"shall issue an order refusing to approve the application\" of a new drug if it is not safe and effective for its intended purpose. §§355(d)(1)-(2), (4)-(5). If the FDA discovers after approval that a drug is unsafe or ineffective, it \"shall, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to the applicant, withdraw approval\" of the drug. 21 U.S.C. § 355(e)(1)-(3). The Act also requires the FDA to classify all devices into one of three categories. §360c(b)(1). Regardless of which category the FDA chooses, there must be a \"reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device.\" 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(A)(i), (B), (C) (1994 ed. and Supp. III); 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Even the \"restricted device\" provision pursuant to which the FDA promulgated the regulations at issue here authorizes the agency to place conditions on the sale or distribution of a device specifically when \"there cannot otherwise be reasonable assurance of its safety and effectiveness.\" 21 U.S.C. § 360j(e). Thus, the Act generally requires the FDA to prevent the marketing of any drug or device where the \"potential for inflicting death or physical injury is not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit.\" United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S. 544, 556 (1979).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "In its rulemaking proceeding, the FDA quite exhaustively documented that \"tobacco products are unsafe,\" \"dangerous,\" and \"cause great pain and suffering from illness.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). It found that the consumption of tobacco products \"presents extraordinary health risks,\" and that \"tobacco use is the single leading cause of preventable death in the United States.\" Id., at 44398. It stated that \"[m]ore than 400,000 people die each year from tobacco-related illnesses, such as cancer, respiratory illnesses, and heart disease, often suffering long and painful deaths,\" and that \"[t]obacco alone kills more people each year in the United States than acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), car accidents, alcohol, homicides, illegal drugs, suicides, and fires, combined.\" Ibid. Indeed, the FDA characterized smoking as \"a pediatric disease,\" id., at 44421, because \"one out of every three young people who become regular smokers -- will die prematurely as a result,\" id., at 44399.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "These findings logically imply that, if tobacco products were \"devices\" under the FDCA, the FDA would be required to remove them from the market. Consider, first, the FDCA's provisions concerning the misbranding of drugs or devices. The Act prohibits \"[t]he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is adultered or misbranded.\" 21 U.S.C. § 331(a). In light of the FDA's findings, two distinct FDCA provisions would render cigarettes and smokeless tobacco misbranded devices. First, §352(j) deems a drug or device misbranded \"[i]f it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.\" The FDA's findings make clear that tobacco products are \"dangerous to health\" when used in the manner prescribed. Second, a drug or device is misbranded under the Act \"[u]nless its labeling bears -- adequate directions for use -- in such manner and form, as are necessary for the protection of users,\" except where such directions are \"not necessary for the protection of the public health.\" §352(f)(1). Given the FDA's conclusions concerning the health consequences of tobacco use, there are no directions that could adequately protect consumers. That is, there are no directions that could make tobacco products safe for obtaining their intended effects. Thus, were tobacco products within the FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would deem them misbranded devices that could not be introduced into interstate commerce. Contrary to the dissent's contention, the Act admits no remedial discretion once it is evident that the device is misbranded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "Second, the FDCA requires the FDA to place all devices that it regulates into one of three classifications. See §360c(b)(1). The agency relies on a device's classification in determining the degree of control and regulation necessary to ensure that there is \"a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). The FDA has yet to classify tobacco products. Instead, the regulations at issue here represent so-called \"general controls,\" which the Act entitles the agency to impose in advance of classification. See id., at 44404-44405. Although the FDCA prescribes no deadline for device classification, the FDA has stated that it will classify tobacco products \"in a future rulemaking\" as required by the Act. Id., at 44412. Given the FDA's findings regarding the health consequences of tobacco use, the agency would have to place cigarettes and smokeless tobacco in Class III because, even after the application of the Act's available controls, they would \"presen[t] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(C). As Class III devices, tobacco products would be subject to the FDCA's premarket approval process. See 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(C) (1994 ed., Supp. III); 21 U.S.C. § 360e; 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Under these provisions, the FDA would be prohibited from approving an application for premarket approval without \"a showing of reasonable assurance that such device is safe under the conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested on the labeling thereof.\" 21 U.S.C. § 360e(d)(2)(A). In view of the FDA's conclusions regarding the health effects of tobacco use, the agency would have no basis for finding any such reasonable assurance of safety. Thus, once the FDA fulfilled its statutory obligation to classify tobacco products, it could not allow them to be marketed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "The FDCA's misbranding and device classification provisions therefore make evident that were the FDA to regulate cigarettes and smokeless tobacco, the Act would require the agency to ban them. In fact, based on these provisions, the FDA itself has previously taken the position that if tobacco products were within its jurisdiction, \"they would have to be removed from the market because it would be impossible to prove they were safe for their intended us[e].\" Public Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971: Hearings before the Commerce Subcommittee on S. 1454, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 239 (1972) (hereinafter 1972 Hearings) (statement of FDA Commissioner Charles Edwards). See also Cigarette Labeling and Advertising: Hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1964) (hereinafter 1964 Hearings) (statement of Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) Secretary An- thony Celebrezze that proposed amendments to the FDCA that would have given the FDA jurisdiction over \"smok- ing product[s]\" \"might well completely outlaw at least cigarettes\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "Congress, however, has foreclosed the removal of tobacco products from the market. A provision of the United States Code currently in force states that \"[t]he marketing of tobacco constitutes one of the greatest basic industries of the United States with ramifying activities which directly affect interstate and foreign commerce at every point, and stable conditions therein are necessary to the general welfare.\" 7 U.S.C. § 1311(a). More importantly, Congress has directly addressed the problem of tobacco and health through legislation on six occasions since 1965. See Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), Pub. L. 89-92, 79 Stat. 282; Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, 84 Stat. 87; Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments of 1983, Pub. L. 98-24, 97 Stat. 175; Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200; Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-252, 100 Stat. 30; Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321, §202, 106 Stat. 394. When Congress enacted these statutes, the adverse health consequences of tobacco use were well known, as were nicotine's pharmacological effects. See, e.g., U.S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare, U.S. Surgeon General's Advisory Committee, Smoking and Health 25-40, 69-75 (1964) (hereinafter 1964 Surgeon General's Report) (concluding that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, coronary artery disease, and chronic bronchitis and emphysema, and that nicotine has various pharmacological effects, including stimulation, tranquilization, and appetite suppression); U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Health Consequences of Smoking for Women 7-12 (1980) (finding that mortality rates for lung cancer, chronic lung disease, and coronary heart disease are increased for both women and men smokers, and that smoking during pregnancy is associated with significant adverse health effects on the unborn fetus and newborn child); U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Why People Smoke Cigarettes (1983), in Smoking Prevention Education Act, Hearings on H. R. 1824 before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 98th Cong., 1st Sess., 32-37 (1983) (hereinafter 1983 House Hearings) (stating that smoking is \"the most widespread example of drug dependence in our country,\" and that cigarettes \"affect the chemistry of the brain and nervous system\"); U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, The Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction 6-9, 145-239 (1988) (hereinafter 1988 Surgeon General's Report) (concluding that tobacco products are addicting in much the same way as heroin and cocaine, and that nicotine is the drug that causes addiction). Nonetheless, Congress stopped well short of ordering a ban. Instead, it has generally regulated the labeling and advertisement of tobacco products, expressly providing that it is the policy of Congress that \"commerce and the national economy may be -- protected to the maximum extent consistent with\" consumers \"be[ing] adequately informed about any adverse health effects.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1331. Congress' decisions to regulate labeling and advertising and to adopt the express policy of protecting \"commerce and the national economy -- to the maximum extent\" reveal its intent that tobacco products remain on the market. Indeed, the collective premise of these statutes is that cigarettes and smokeless tobacco will continue to be sold in the United States. A ban of tobacco products by the FDA would therefore plainly contradict congressional policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "The FDA apparently recognized this dilemma and concluded, somewhat ironically, that tobacco products are actually \"safe\" within the meaning of the FDCA. In promulgating its regulations, the agency conceded that \"tobacco products are unsafe, as that term is conventionally understood.\" 61 Fed. Reg. 44412 (1996). Nonetheless, the FDA reasoned that, in determining whether a device is safe under the Act, it must consider \"not only the risks presented by a product but also any of the countervailing effects of use of that product, including the consequences of not permitting the product to be marketed.\" Id., at 44412-44413. Applying this standard, the FDA found that, because of the high level of addiction among tobacco users, a ban would likely be \"dangerous.\" Id., at 44413. In particular, current tobacco users could suffer from extreme withdrawal, the health care system and available pharmaceuticals might not be able to meet the treatment demands of those suffering from withdrawal, and a black market offering cigarettes even more dangerous than those currently sold legally would likely develop. Ibid. The FDA therefore concluded that, \"while taking cigarettes and smokeless tobacco off the market could prevent some people from becoming addicted and reduce death and disease for others, the record does not establish that such a ban is the appropriate public health response under the act.\" Id., at 44398.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "It may well be, as the FDA asserts, that \"these factors must be considered when developing a regulatory scheme that achieves the best public health result for these products.\" Id., at 44413. But the FDA's judgment that leaving tobacco products on the market \"is more effective in achieving public health goals than a ban,\" ibid., is no substitute for the specific safety determinations required by the FDCA's various operative provisions. Several provisions in the Act require the FDA to determine that the product itself is safe as used by consumers. That is, the product's probable therapeutic benefits must outweigh its risk of harm. See United States v. Rutherford, 442 U.S., at 555 (\"[T]he Commissioner generally considers a drug safe when the expected therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use\"). In contrast, the FDA's conception of safety would allow the agency, with respect to each provision of the FDCA that requires the agency to determine a product's \"safety\" or \"dangerousness,\" to compare the aggregate health effects of alternative administrative actions. This is a qualitatively different inquiry. Thus, although the FDA has concluded that a ban would be \"dangerous,\" it has not concluded that tobacco products are \"safe\" as that term is used throughout the Act.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29\n",
      "A straightforward reading of this provision dictates that the FDA must weigh the probable therapeutic benefits of the device to the consumer against the probable risk of injury. Applied to tobacco products, the inquiry is whether their purported benefits-satisfying addiction, stimulation and sedation, and weight control-outweigh the risks to health from their use. To accommodate the FDA's conception of safety, however, one must read \"any probable benefit to health\" to include the benefit to public health stemming from adult consumers' continued use of tobacco products, even though the reduction of tobacco use is the raison d' ;tre of the regulations. In other words, the FDA is forced to contend that the very evil it seeks to combat is a \"benefit to health.\" This is implausible.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30\n",
      "The FDA's conception of safety is also incompatible with the FDCA's misbranding provision. Again, §352(j) provides that a product is \"misbranded\" if \"it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof.\" According to the FDA's understanding, a product would be \"dangerous to health,\" and therefore misbranded under §352(j), when, in comparison to leaving the product on the market, a ban would not produce \"adverse health consequences\" in aggregate. Quite simply, these are different inquiries. Although banning a particular product might be detrimental to public health in aggregate, the product could still be \"dangerous to health\" when used as directed. Section 352(j) focuses on dangers to the consumer from use of the product, not those stemming from the agency's remedial measures.\n",

      "31\n",
      "Consequently, the analogy made by the FDA and the dissent to highly toxic drugs used in the treatment of various cancers is unpersuasive. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44413 (1996); post, at 17 (opinion of Breyer, J.). Although \"dangerous\" in some sense, these drugs are safe within the meaning of the Act because, for certain patients, the therapeutic benefits outweigh the risk of harm. Accordingly, such drugs cannot properly be described as \"dangerous to health\" under 21 U.S.C. § 352(j). The same is not true for tobacco products. As the FDA has documented in great detail, cigarettes and smokeless tobacco are an unsafe means to obtaining any pharmacological effect.\n",

      "The dissent contends that our conclusion means that \"the FDCA requires the FDA to ban outright 'dangerous' drugs or devices,\" post, at 14, and that this is a \"perverse\" reading of the statute, id., at 14, 21. This misunderstands our holding. The FDA, consistent with the FDCA, may clearly regulate many \"dangerous\" products without banning them. Indeed, virtually every drug or device poses dangers under certain conditions. What the FDA may not do is conclude that a drug or device cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose and yet, at the same time, allow that product to remain on the market. Such regulation is incompatible with the FDCA's core objective of ensuring that every drug or device is safe and effective.\n",

      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "Considering the FDCA as a whole, it is clear that Congress intended to exclude tobacco products from the FDA's jurisdiction. A fundamental precept of the FDCA is that any product regulated by the FDA-but not banned-must be safe for its intended use. Various provisions of the Act make clear that this refers to the safety of using the product to obtain its intended effects, not the public health ramifications of alternative administrative actions by the FDA. That is, the FDA must determine that there is a reasonable assurance that the product's therapeutic benefits outweigh the risk of harm to the consumer. According to this standard, the FDA has concluded that, although tobacco products might be effective in delivering certain pharmacological effects, they are \"unsafe\" and \"dangerous\" when used for these purposes. Consequently, if tobacco products were within the FDA's jurisdiction, the Act would require the FDA to remove them from the market entirely. But a ban would contradict Congress' clear intent as expressed in its more recent, tobacco-specific legislation. The inescapable conclusion is that there is no room for tobacco products within the FDCA's regulatory scheme. If they cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose, and yet they cannot be banned, they simply do not fit.\n",

      "In determining whether Congress has spoken directly to the FDA's authority to regulate tobacco, we must also consider in greater detail the tobacco-specific legislation that Congress has enacted over the past 35 years. At the time a statute is enacted, it may have a range of plausible meanings. Over time, however, subsequent acts can shape or focus those meanings. The \"classic judicial task of reconciling many laws enacted over time, and getting them to 'make sense' in combination, necessarily assumes that the implications of a statute may be altered by the implications of a later statute.\" United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S., at 453. This is particularly so where the scope of the earlier statute is broad but the subsequent statutes more specifically address the topic at hand. As we recognized recently in United States v. Estate of Romani, \"a specific policy embodied in a later federal statute should control our construction of the [earlier] statute, even though it ha[s] not been expressly amended.\" 523 U.S., at 530-531.\n",

      "Congress has enacted six separate pieces of legislation since 1965 addressing the problem of tobacco use and human health. See supra, at 14. Those statutes, among other things, require that health warnings appear on all packaging and in all print and outdoor advertisements, see 15 U.S.C. § 1331 1333, 4402; prohibit the advertisement of tobacco products through \"any medium of electronic communication\" subject to regulation by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), see §§1335, 4402(f); require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to report every three years to Congress on research findings concerning \"the addictive property of tobacco,\" 42 U.S.C. § 290aa-2(b)(2); and make States' receipt of certain federal block grants contingent on their making it unlawful \"for any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor of tobacco products to sell or distribute any such product to any individual under the age of 18,\" §300x-26(a)(1).\n",

In fact, on several occasions over this period, and after the health consequences of tobacco use and nicotine's pharmacological effects had become well known, Congress considered and rejected bills that would have granted the FDA such jurisdiction. Under these circumstances, it is evident that Congress' tobacco-specific statutes have effectively ratified the FDA's long-held position that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Congress has created a distinct regulatory scheme to address the problem of tobacco and health, and that scheme, as presently constructed, precludes any role for the FDA.\n",

      "On January 11, 1964, the Surgeon General released the report of the Advisory Committee on Smoking and Health. That report documented the deleterious health effects of smoking in great detail, concluding, in relevant part, \"that cigarette smoking contributes substantially to mortality from certain specific diseases and to the overall death rate.\" 1964 Surgeon General's Report 31. It also identified the pharmacological effects of nicotine, including \"stimulation,\" \"tranquilization,\" and \"suppression of appetite.\" Id., at 74-75. Seven days after the report's release, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking, see 29 Fed. Reg. 530-532 (1964), and in June 1964, the FTC promulgated a final rule requiring cigarette manufacturers \"to disclose, clearly and prominently, in all advertising and on every pack, box, carton or other container -- that cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer and other diseases,\" id., at 8325. The rule was to become effective January 1, 1965, but, on a request from Congress, the FTC postponed enforcement for six months. See Cipollone v.

Surgeon General Terry was asked during hearings in 1964 whether HEW had the \"authority to brand or label the packages of cigarettes or to control the advertising there.\" Id., at 56. The Surgeon General stated that \"we do not have such authority in existing laws governing the -- Food and Drug Administration.\" Ibid. Similarly, FDA Deputy Commissioner Rankin testified in 1965 that \"[t]he Food and Drug Administration has no jurisdiction under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act over tobacco, unless it bears drug claims.\" Cigarette Labeling and Advertising-1965: Hearings on H.

In fact, HEW Secretary Celebrezze urged Congress not to amend the FDCA to cover \"smoking products\" because, in light of the findings in the Surgeon General's report, such a \"provision might well completely outlaw at least cigarettes.

      "The FDA's disavowal of jurisdiction was consistent with the position that it had taken since the agency's inception. As the FDA concedes, it never asserted authority to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed until it promulgated the regulations at issue here. See Brief for Petitioners 37; see also Brief for Appellee (FDA) in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F.2d 236 (CADC 1980), in 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4, pp. 14-15 (\"In the 73 years since the enactment of the original Food and Drug Act, and in the 41 years since the promulgation of the modern Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the FDA has repeatedly informed Congress that cigarettes are beyond the scope of the statute absent health claims establishing a therapeutic intent on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor\").\n",

      "The FDA's position was also consistent with Congress' specific intent when it enacted the FDCA. Before the Act's adoption in 1938, the FDA's predecessor agency, the Bureau of Chemistry, announced that it lacked authority to regulate tobacco products under the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, ch. 3915, 34 Stat. 768, unless they were marketed with therapeutic claims. See U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Bureau of Chemistry, 13 Service and Regulatory Announcements 24 (Apr. 1914) (Feb. 1914 Announcements 13, Opinion of Chief of Bureau C. L. Alsberg). In 1929, Congress considered and rejected a bill \"[t]o amend the Food and Drugs Act of June 30, 1906, by extending its provisions to tobacco and tobacco products.\" S. 1468, 71st Cong., 1st Sess., 1. See also 71 Cong. Rec. 2589 (1929) (remarks of Sen. Smoot). And, as the FDA admits, there is no evidence in the text of the FDCA or its legislative history that Congress in 1938 even considered the applicability of the Act to tobacco products. See Brief for Petitioners 22, n. 4. Given the economic and political significance of the tobacco industry at the time, it is extremely unlikely that Congress could have intended to place tobacco within the ambit of the FDCA absent any discussion of the matter. Of course, whether the Congress that enacted the FDCA specifically intended the Act to cover tobacco products is not determinative; \"it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\" Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 79 (1998); see also TVA v. Hill, 437 U.S. 153, 185 (1978) (\"It is not for us to speculate, much less act, on whether Congress would have altered its stance had the specific events of this case been anticipated\"). Nonetheless, this intent is certainly relevant to understanding the basis for the FDA's representations to Congress and the background against which Congress enacted subsequent tobacco-specific legislation.\n",

      "Moreover, before enacting the FCLAA in 1965, Congress considered and rejected several proposals to give the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco. In April 1963, Representative Udall introduced a bill \"[t]o amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act so as to make that Act applicable to smoking products.\" H. R. 5973, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., 1. Two months later, Senator Moss introduced an identical bill in the Senate. S. 1682, 88th Cong., 1st Sess. (1963). In discussing his proposal on the Senate floor, Senator Moss explained that \"this amendment simply places smoking products under FDA jurisdiction, along with foods, drugs, and cosmetics.\" 109 Cong. Rec. 10322 (1963). In December 1963, Representative Rhodes introduced another bill that would have amended the FDCA \"by striking out 'food, drug, device, or cosmetic, each place where it appears therein and inserting in lieu thereof 'food, drug, device, cosmetic, or smoking product.' \" H. R. 9512, 88th Cong., 1st Sess., §3 (1963). And in January 1965, five months before passage of the FCLAA, Representative Udall again introduced a bill to amend the FDCA \"to make that Act applicable to smoking products.\" H. R. 2248, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 1. None of these proposals became law.\n",

      "Congress ultimately decided in 1965 to subject tobacco products to the less extensive regulatory scheme of the FCLAA, which created a \"comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\" Pub. L. 89-92, §2, 79 Stat. 282. The FCLAA rejected any regulation of advertising, but it required the warning, \"Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health,\" to appear on all cigarette packages. Id., §4, 79 Stat. 283. In the Act's \"Declaration of Policy,\" Congress stated that its objective was to balance the goals of ensuring that \"the public may be adequately informed that cigarette smoking may be hazardous to health\" and protecting \"commerce and the national economy -- to the maximum extent.\" Id., §2, 79 Stat. 282 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1331).\n",

      "Not only did Congress reject the proposals to grant the FDA jurisdiction, but it explicitly preempted any other regulation of cigarette labeling: \"No statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by -- this Act, shall be required on any cigarette package.\" Id., §5(a), 79 Stat. 283. The regulation of product labeling, however, is an integral aspect of the FDCA, both as it existed in 1965 and today. The labeling requirements currently imposed by the FDCA, which are essentially identical to those in force in 1965, require the FDA to regulate the labeling of drugs and devices to protect the safety of consumers. See 21 U.S.C. § 352; 21 U.S.C. § 352 (1964 ed. and Supp. IV). As discussed earlier, the Act requires that all products bear \"adequate directions for use -- as are necessary for the protection of users,\" 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1); 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(1) (1964 ed.); requires that all products provide \"adequate warnings against use in those pathological conditions or by children where its use may be dangerous to health,\" 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2); 21 U.S.C. § 352(f)(2) (1964 ed.); and deems a product misbranded \"[i]f it is dangerous to health when used in the dosage or manner, or with the frequency or duration prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling thereof,\" 21 U.S.C. § 352(j); 21 U.S.C. § 352(j) (1964 ed.). In this sense, the FCLAA was-and remains-incompatible with FDA regulation of tobacco products. This is not to say that the FCLAA's preemption provision by itself necessarily foreclosed FDA jurisdiction. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S., at 518-519. But it is an important factor in assessing whether Congress ratified the agency's position-that is, whether Congress adopted a regulatory approach to the problem of tobacco and health that contemplated no role for the FDA.\n",

      "\n",
      "44\n",
      "Further, the FCLAA evidences Congress' intent to preclude any administrative agency from exercising significant policymaking authority on the subject of smoking and health. In addition to prohibiting any additional requirements for cigarette labeling, the FCLAA provided that \"[n]o statement relating to smoking and health shall be required in the advertising of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\" Pub. L. 89-92, §5(b), 79 Stat. 283.

      "Subsequent tobacco-specific legislation followed a similar pattern. By the FCLAA's own terms, the prohibition on any additional cigarette labeling or advertising regulations relating to smoking and health was to expire July 1, 1969. See §10, 79 Stat. 284. In anticipation of the provision's expiration, both the FCC and the FTC proposed rules governing the advertisement of cigarettes. See 34 Fed. Reg. 1959 (1969) (FCC proposed rule to \"ban the broadcast of cigarette commercials by radio and television stations\"); id., at 7917 (FTC proposed rule requiring manufacturers to disclose on all packaging and in all print advertising \" 'that cigarette smoking is dangerous to health and may cause death from cancer, coronary heart disease, chronic bronchitis, pulmonary emphysema, and other diseases' \"). After debating the proper role for administrative agencies in the regulation of tobacco, see generally Cigarette Labeling and Advertising-1969: Hearings before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 91st Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2 (1969), Congress amended the FCLAA by banning cigarette advertisements \"on any medium of electronic communication subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission\" and strengthening the warning required to appear on cigarette packages. Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, §§4, 6, 84 Stat. 88-89. Importantly, Congress extended indefinitely the prohibition on any other regulation of cigarette labeling with respect to smoking and health (again despite the importance of labeling regulation under the FDCA). §5(a), 84 Stat. 88 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1334(a)). Moreover, it expressly forbade the FTC from taking any action on its pending rule until July 1, 1971, and it required the FTC, if it decided to proceed with its rule thereafter, to notify Congress at least six months in advance of the rule's becoming effective. §7(a), 84 Stat. 89. As the chairman of the House committee in which the bill originated stated, \"the Congress-the body elected by the people-must make the policy determinations involved in this legislation-and not some agency made up of appointed officials.\" 116 Cong.

      "Four years later, after Congress had transferred the authority to regulate substances covered by the Hazardous Substances Act (HSA) from the FDA to the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the American Public Health Association, joined by Senator Moss, petitioned the CPSC to regulate cigarettes yielding more than 21 milligrams of tar. See Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F.3d 236, 241 (CADC 1980); R. Kluger, Ashes to Ashes 375-376 (1996). After the CPSC determined that it lacked authority under the HSA to regulate cigarettes, a District Court held that the Act did, in fact, grant the CPSC such jurisdiction and ordered it to reexamine the petition. See American Public Health Association v. Consumer Product Safety Commission, [1972-1975 Transfer Binder] CCH Consumer Prod. Safety Guide 75,081 (DC 1975), vacated as moot, No. 75-1863 (CADC 1976). Before the CPSC could take any action, however, Congress mooted the issue by adopting legislation that eliminated the agency's authority to regulate \"tobacco and tobacco products.\" Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvements Act of 1976, Pub. L. 94-284, §3(c), 90 Stat. 503 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 1261(f)(2)). Senator Moss acknowledged that the \"legislation, in effect, reverse[d]\" the District Court's decision, 121 Cong.

A separate statement in the Senate Report underscored that the legislation's purpose was to \"unmistakably reaffirm the clear mandate of the Congress that the basic regulation of tobacco and tobacco products is governed by the legislation dealing with the subject, -- and that any further regulation in this sensitive and complex area must be reserved for specific Congressional action.\" S.

He further stated that the FDA believed that the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act \"demonstrates that the regulation of cigarettes is to be the domain of Congress,\" and that \"labeling or banning cigarettes is a step that can be take[n] only by the Congress.

ASH asserted that nicotine was highly addictive and had strong physiological effects on the body; that those effects were \"intended\" because consumers use tobacco products precisely to obtain those effects; and that tobacco causes thousands of premature deaths annually. Ibid. In denying ASH's petition, FDA Commissioner Kennedy stated that \"[t]he interpretation of the Act by FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drug unless health claims are made by the vendors.\" Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf (Dec. 5, 1977), App. 47. After the matter proceeded to litigation, the FDA argued in its brief to the Court of Appeals that \"cigarettes are not comprehended within the statutory definition of the term 'drug' absent objective evidence that vendors represent or intend that their products be used as a drug.\" Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F.2d 236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4, pp. 27-28. The FDA also contended that Congress had \"long been aware that the FDA does not consider cigarettes to be within its regulatory authority in the absence of health claims made on behalf of the manufacturer or vendor,\" and that, because \"Congress has never acted to disturb the agency's interpretation,\" it had \"acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation of the statutory limits on its authority to regulate cigarettes.\" Id., at 23, 27, n. 23.

      "Against this backdrop, Congress enacted three additional tobacco-specific statutes over the next four years that incrementally expanded its regulatory scheme for tobacco products. In 1983, Congress adopted the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Amendments, Pub. L. 98-24, 97 Stat. 175 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 290aa et seq.), which require the Secretary of HHS to report to Congress every three years on the \"addictive property of tobacco\" and to include recommendations for action that the Secretary may deem appropriate. A year later, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act, Pub. L. 98-474, 98 Stat. 2200, which amended the FCLAA by again modifying the prescribed warning. Notably, during debate on the Senate floor, Senator Hawkins argued that the Act was necessary in part because \"[u]nder the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Congress exempted tobacco products.\" 130 Cong. Rec. 26953 (1984). And in 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986 (CSTHEA), Pub. L. 99-252, 100 Stat. 30 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 4401 et seq.), which essentially extended the regulatory provisions of the FCLAA to smokeless tobacco products. Like the FCLAA, the CSTHEA provided that \"[n]o statement relating to the use of smokeless tobacco products and health, other than the statements required by [the Act], shall be required by any Federal agency to appear on any package -- of a smokeless tobacco product.\" §7(a), 100 Stat. 34 (codified at 15 U.S.C. § 4406(a)).

      "In 1988, the Surgeon General released a report summarizing the abundant scientific literature demonstrating that \"[c]igarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting,\" and that \"nicotine is psychoactive\" and \"causes physical dependence characterized by a withdrawal syndrome that usually accompanies nicotine abstinence.\" 1988 Surgeon General's Report 14. The report further concluded that the \"pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine.\" Id., at 15. In the same year, FDA Commissioner Young stated before Congress that \"it doesn't look like it is possible to regulate [tobacco] under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act even though smoking, I think, has been widely recognized as being harmful to human health.\" Rural Development, Agriculture, and Related Agencies Appropriations for 1989: Hearings before a Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 409 (1988). At the same hearing, the FDA's General Counsel testified that \"what is fairly important in FDA law is whether a product has a therapeutic purpose,\" and \"[c]igarettes themselves are not used for a therapeutic purpose as that concept is ordinarily understood.\" Id., at 410. Between 1987 and 1989, Congress considered three more bills that would have amended the FDCA to grant the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. See H. R. 3294, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (1987); H. R. 1494, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989); S. 769, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. (1989). As before, Congress rejected the proposals. In 1992, Congress instead adopted the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration Reorganization Act, Pub. L. 102-321, §202, 106 Stat. 394 (codified at 42 U.S.C. § 300x et seq.), which creates incentives for States to regulate the retail sale of tobacco products by making States' receipt of certain block grants contingent on their prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors.\n",

      "Taken together, these actions by Congress over the past 35 years preclude an interpretation of the FDCA that grants the FDA jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products. We do not rely on Congress' failure to act-its consideration and rejection of bills that would have given the FDA this authority-in reaching this conclusion. Indeed, this is not a case of simple inaction by Congress that purportedly represents its acquiescence in an agency's position. To the contrary, Congress has enacted several statutes addressing the particular subject of tobacco and health, creating a distinct regulatory scheme for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. In doing so, Congress has been aware of tobacco's health hazards and its pharmacological effects. It has also enacted this legislation against the background of the FDA repeatedly and consistently asserting that it lacks jurisdiction under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed. Further, Congress has persistently acted to preclude a meaningful role for any administrative agency in making policy on the subject of tobacco and health. Moreover, the substance of Congress' regulatory scheme is, in an important respect, incompatible with FDA jurisdiction. Although the supervision of product labeling to protect consumer health is a substantial component of the FDA's regulation of drugs and devices, see 21 U.S.C. § 352 (1994 ed. and Supp. III), the FCLAA and the CSTHEA explicitly prohibit any federal agency from imposing any health-related labeling requirements on cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products, see 15 U.

      "Under these circumstances, it is clear that Congress' tobacco-specific legislation has effectively ratified the FDA's previous position that it lacks jurisdiction to regulate tobacco. As in Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), \"[i]t is hardly conceivable that Congress-and in this setting, any Member of Congress-was not abundantly aware of what was going on.\" Id., at 600-601. Congress has affirmatively acted to address the issue of tobacco and health, relying on the representations of the FDA that it had no authority to regulate tobacco. It has created a distinct scheme to regulate the sale of tobacco products, focused on labeling and advertising, and premised on the belief that the FDA lacks such jurisdiction under the FDCA. As a result, Congress' tobacco-specific statutes preclude the FDA from regulating tobacco products as customarily marketed.\n",

      "Although the dissent takes issue with our discussion of the FDA's change in position, post, at 26-29, our conclusion does not rely on the fact that the FDA's assertion of jurisdiction represents a sharp break with its prior interpretation of the FDCA. Certainly, an agency's initial interpretation of a statute that it is charged with administering is not \"carved in stone.\" Chevron, 467 U.S., at 863; see also Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996). As we recognized in Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983), agencies \"must be given ample latitude to 'adapt their rules and policies to the demands of changing circumstances.' \" Id., at 42 (quoting Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 784 (1968)). The consistency of the FDA's prior position is significant in this case for a different reason: it provides important context to Congress' enactment of its tobacco-specific legislation. When the FDA repeatedly informed Congress that the FDCA does not grant it the authority to regulate tobacco products, its statements were consistent with the agency's unwavering position since its inception, and with the position that its predecessor agency had first taken in 1914. Although not crucial, the consistency of the FDA's prior position bolsters the conclusion that when Congress created a distinct regulatory scheme addressing the subject of tobacco and health, it understood that the FDA is without jurisdiction to regulate tobacco products and ratified that position.\n",

      "\n",
      "55\n",
      "The dissent also argues that the proper inference to be drawn from Congress' tobacco-specific legislation is \"critically ambivalent.\" Post, at 22. We disagree. In that series of statutes, Congress crafted a specific legislative response to the problem of tobacco and health, and it did so with the understanding, based on repeated assertions by the FDA, that the agency has no authority under the FDCA to regulate tobacco products. Moreover, Congress expressly preempted any other regulation of the labeling of tobacco products concerning their health consequences, even though the oversight of labeling is central to the FDCA's regulatory scheme. And in addressing the subject, Congress consistently evidenced its intent to preclude any federal agency from exercising significant policymaking authority in the area. Under these circumstances, we believe the appropriate inference-that Congress intended to ratify the FDA's prior position that it lacks jurisdiction-is unmistakable.\n",

      "The dissent alternatively argues that, even if Congress' subsequent tobacco-specific legislation did, in fact, ratify the FDA's position, that position was merely a contingent disavowal of jurisdiction. Specifically, the dissent contends that \"the FDA's traditional view was largely premised on a perceived inability to prove the necessary statutory 'intent' requirement.\" Post, at 30. A fair reading of the FDA's representations prior to 1995, however, demonstrates that the agency's position was essentially unconditional. See, e.g., 1972 Hearings 239, 242 (statement of Commissioner Edwards) (\"[R]egulation of cigarettes is to be the domain of Congress,\" and \"[a]ny such move by FDA would be inconsistent with the clear congressional intent\"); 1983 House Hearings 74 (statement of Assistant Secretary Brandt) (\"[T]he issue of regulation of tobacco -- is something that Congress has reserved to itself\"); 1983 Senate Hearings 56 (statement of Assistant Secretary Brandt) (\"Congress has assumed the responsibility of regulating -- cigarettes\"); Brief for Appellee in Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F.2d 236 (CADC 1980), 9 Rec. in No. 97-1604 (CA4), Tab No. 4, pp. 27, n. 23 (because \"Congress has never acted to disturb the agency's interpretation,\" it \"acquiesced in the FDA's interpretation\"). To the extent the agency's position could be characterized as equivocal, it was only with respect to the well-established exception of when the manufacturer makes express claims of therapeutic benefit. See, e.g., 1965 Hearings 193 (statement of Deputy Commissioner Rankin) (\"The Food and Drug Administration has no jurisdiction under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act over tobacco, unless it bears drug claims\"); Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf from FDA Commissioner Kennedy (Dec. 5, 1977), App. 47 (\"The interpretation of the Act by FDA consistently has been that cigarettes are not a drug unless health claims are made by the vendors\"); Letter to ASH Executive Director Banzhaf from FDA Commissioner Goyan (Nov. 25, 1980), App. 67 (\"Insofar as rulemaking would relate to cigarettes or attached filters as customarily marketed, we have concluded that FDA has no jurisdiction\"). Thus, what Congress ratified was the FDA's plain and resolute position that the FDCA gives the agency no authority to regulate tobacco products as customarily marketed.\n",

      "Finally, our inquiry into whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue is shaped, at least in some measure, by the nature of the question presented. Deference under Chevron to an agency's construction of a statute that it administers is premised on the theory that a statute's ambiguity constitutes an implicit delegation from Congress to the agency to fill in the statutory gaps. See Chevron, 467 U.S., at 844. In extraordinary cases, however, there may be reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress has intended such an implicit delegation. Cf. Breyer, Judicial Review of Questions of Law and Policy, 38 Admin. L. Rev. 363, 370 (1986) (\"A court may also ask whether the legal question is an important one.

      "This is hardly an ordinary case. Contrary to its representations to Congress since 1914, the FDA has now asserted jurisdiction to regulate an industry constituting a significant portion of the American economy. In fact, the FDA contends that, were it to determine that tobacco products provide no \"reasonable assurance of safety,\" it would have the authority to ban cigarettes and smokeless tobacco entirely. See Brief for Petitioners 35-36; Reply Brief for Petitioners 14. Owing to its unique place in American history and society, tobacco has its own unique political history. Congress, for better or for worse, has created a distinct regulatory scheme for tobacco products, squarely rejected proposals to give the FDA jurisdiction over tobacco, and repeatedly acted to preclude any agency from exercising significant policymaking authority in the area. Given this history and the breadth of the authority that the FDA has asserted, we are obliged to defer not to the agency's expansive construction of the statute, but to Congress' consistent judgment to deny the FDA this power.\n",

That case involved the proper construction of the term \"modify\" in §203(b) of the Communications Act of 1934. The FCC contended that, because the Act gave it the discretion to \"modify any requirement\" imposed under the statute, it therefore possessed the authority to render voluntary the otherwise mandatory requirement that long distance carriers file their rates. Id., at 225. We rejected the FCC's construction, finding \"not the slightest doubt\" that Congress had directly spoken to the question. Id., at 228. In reasoning even more apt here, we concluded that \"[i]t is highly unlikely that Congress would leave the determination of whether an industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rate-regulated to agency discretion-and even more unlikely that it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to 'modify' rate-filing requirements.\" Id., at 231.\n",

Nonetheless, no matter how \"important, conspicuous, and controversial\" the issue, and regardless of how likely the public is to hold the Executive Branch politically accountable, post, at 31, an administrative agency's power to regulate in the public interest must always be grounded in a valid grant of authority from Congress.

      "In its own interpretation, the majority nowhere denies the following two salient points. First, tobacco products (including cigarettes) fall within the scope of this statutory definition, read literally. Cigarettes achieve their mood-stabilizing effects through the interaction of the chemical nicotine and the cells of the central nervous system. Both cigarette manufacturers and smokers alike know of, and desire, that chemically induced result. Hence, cigarettes are \"intended to affect\" the body's \"structure\" and \"function,\" in the literal sense of these words.\n",

      "Second, the statute's basic purpose-the protection of public health-supports the inclusion of cigarettes within its scope. See United States v. Article of Drug ... Bacto&nbhyph;Unidisk, 394 U.S. 784, 798 (1969) (FDCA \"is to be given a liberal construction consistent with [its] overriding purpose to protect the public health\" (emphasis added)).

      "68\n",
      "Despite the FDCA's literal language and general purpose (both of which support the FDA's finding that cigarettes come within its statutory authority), the majority nonetheless reads the statute as excluding tobacco products for two basic reasons:\n",

      "\n",
      "69\n",
      "(1)  the FDCA does not \"fit\" the case of tobacco because the statute requires the FDA to prohibit dangerous drugs or devices (like cigarettes) outright, and the agency concedes that simply banning the sale of cigarettes is not a proper remedy, ante, at 19-20; and\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "70\n",
      "(2)  Congress has enacted other statutes, which, when viewed in light of the FDA's long history of denying tobacco-related jurisdiction and considered together with Congress' failure explicitly to grant the agency tobacco-specific authority, demonstrate that Congress did not intend for the FDA to exercise jurisdiction over tobacco, ante, at 33-34.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "71\n",
      "In my view, neither of these propositions is valid. Rather, the FDCA does not significantly limit the FDA's remedial alternatives. See infra, at 14-21. And the later statutes do not tell the FDA it cannot exercise jurisdiction, but simply leave FDA jurisdictional law where Congress found it. See infra, at 21-26; cf. Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, 111 Stat. 2380 (codified at note following 21 U.S.C. § 321 (1994 ed., Supp. III)) (statute \"shall\" not \"be construed to affect the question of whether\" the FDA \"has any authority to regulate any tobacco product\").\n",

In short, I believe that the most important indicia of statutory meaning-language and purpose-along with the FDCA's legislative history (described briefly in Part I) are sufficient to establish that the FDA has authority to regulate tobacco. The statute-specific arguments against jurisdiction that the tobacco companies and the majority rely upon (discussed in Part II) are based on erroneous assumptions and, thus, do not defeat the jurisdiction-supporting thrust of the FDCA's language and purpose. The inferences that the majority draws from later legislative history are not persuasive, since (as I point out in Part III) one can just as easily infer from the later laws that Congress did not intend to affect the FDA's tobacco-related authority at all. And the fact that the FDA changed its mind about the scope of its own jurisdiction is legally insignificant because (as Part IV establishes) the agency's reasons for changing course are fully justified. Finally, as I explain in Part V, the degree of accountability that likely will attach to the FDA's action in this case should alleviate any concern that Congress, rather than an administrative agency, ought to make this important regulatory decision.\n",

Cf. Gray v. Powell, 314 U.S. 402, 411-412 (1941) (Congress \"could have legislated specifically\" but decided \"to delegate that function to those whose experience in a particular field gave promise of a better informed, more equitable\" determination). Thus, at around the same time that it added the relevant language to the FDCA, Congress enacted laws granting other administrative agencies even broader powers to regulate much of the Nation's transportation and communication. See, e.g., Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938, ch. 601, §401(d)(1), 52 Stat. 987 (Civil Aeronautics Board to regulate airlines within confines of highly general \"public convenience and necessity\" standard); Motor Carrier Act of 1935, ch. 498, §204(a)(1), 49 Stat. 546 (Interstate Commerce Commission to establish \"reasonable requirements\" for trucking); Communications Act of 1934, ch. 652, §201(a), 48 Stat. 1070 (Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate radio, later television, within confines of even broader \"public interest\" standard). Why would the 1938 New Deal Congress suddenly have hesitated to delegate to so well established an agency as the FDA all of the discretionary authority that a straightforward reading of the relevant statutory language implies?\n",

      "Nor is it surprising that such a statutory delegation of power could lead after many years to an assertion of jurisdiction that the 1938 legislators might not have expected. Such a possibility is inherent in the very nature of a broad delegation. In 1938, it may well have seemed unlikely that the FDA would ever bring cigarette manufacturers within the FDCA's statutory language by proving that cigarettes produce chemical changes in the body and that the makers \"intended\" their product chemically to affect the body's \"structure\" or \"function.\" Or, back then, it may have seemed unlikely that, even assuming such proof, the FDA actually would exercise its discretion to regulate so popular a product.

After all, this Court has read more narrowly phrased statutes to grant what might have seemed even more unlikely assertions of agency jurisdiction. See, e.g., Permian Basin Area Rate Cases, 390 U.S. 747, 774-777 (1968) (statutory authority to regulate interstate \"transportation\" of natural gas includes authority to regulate \"prices\" charged by field producers); Phillips Petroleum Co. v.

Taken literally, this definition might include everything from room air conditioners to thermal pajamas. The companies argue that, to avoid such a result, the meaning of \"drug\" or \"device\" should be confined to medical or therapeutic products, narrowly defined. See Brief for Respondent United States Tobacco Co. 8-9.\n",

      "The companies may well be right that the statute should not be read to cover room air conditioners and winter underwear. But I do not agree that we must accept their proposed limitation. For one thing, such a cramped reading contravenes the established purpose of the statutory language. See Bacto-Unidisk, 394 U.S., at 798 (third definition is \"clearly, broader than any strict medical definition\"); 1 Leg. Hist. 108 (definition covers products \"that cannot be alleged to be treatments for diseased conditions\"). For another, the companies' restriction would render the other two \"drug\" definitions superfluous. See 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(A), (g)(1)(B) (covering articles in the leading pharmacology compendia and those \"intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "87\n",
      "Most importantly, the statute's language itself supplies a different, more suitable, limitation: that a \"drug\" must be a chemical agent. The FDCA's \"device\" definition states that an article which affects the structure or function of the body is a \"device\" only if it \"does not achieve its primary intended purposes through chemical action within -- the body,\" and \"is not dependent upon being metabolized for the achievement of its primary intended purposes.\" §321(h) (emphasis added). One can readily infer from this language that at least an article that does achieve its primary purpose through chemical action within the body and that is dependent upon being metabolized is a \"drug,\" provided that it otherwise falls within the scope of the \"drug\" definition. And one need not hypothesize about air conditioners or thermal pajamas to recognize that the chemical nicotine, an important tobacco ingredient, meets this test.\n",

      "Although I now oversimplify, the FDA has determined that once nicotine enters the body, the blood carries it almost immediately to the brain. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44698-44699 (1966). Nicotine then binds to receptors on the surface of brain cells, setting off a series of chemical reactions that alter one's mood and produce feelings of sedation and stimulation. See id., at 44699, 44739. Nicotine also increases the number of nicotinic receptors on the brain's surface, and alters its normal electrical activity. See id., at 44739. And nicotine stimulates the transmission of a natural chemical that \"rewards\" the body with pleasurable sensations (dopamine), causing nicotine addiction. See id., at 44700, 44721-44722. The upshot is that nicotine stabilizes mood, suppresses appetite, tranquilizes, and satisfies a physical craving that nicotine itself has helped to create-all through chemical action within the body after being metabolized.\n",

      "This physiology-and not simply smoker psychology-helps to explain why as many as 75% of adult smokers believe that smoking \"reduce[s] nervous irritation,\" 60 Fed. Reg. 41579 (1995); why 73% of young people (10- to 22-year-olds) who begin smoking say they do so for \"relaxation,\" 61 Fed. Reg. 44814 (1996); and why less than 3% of the 70% of smokers who want to quit each year succeed, id., at 44704. That chemistry also helps to explain the Surgeon General's findings that smokers believe \"smoking [makes them] feel better\" and smoke more \"in situations involving negative mood.\" Id., at 44814. And, for present purposes, that chemistry demonstrates that nicotine affects the \"structure\" and \"function\" of the body in a manner that is quite similar to the effects of other regulated substances. See id., at 44667 (FDA regulates Valium, NoDoz, weight-loss products). Indeed, addiction, sedation, stimulation, and weight loss are precisely the kinds of product effects that the FDA typically reviews and controls. And, since the nicotine in cigarettes plainly is not a \"food,\" its chemical effects suffice to establish that it is as a \"drug\" (and the cigarette that delivers it a drug-delivery \"device\") for the purpose of the FDCA.\n",

The companies say that \"intended\" in this context is a term of art. See Brief for Respondent Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. 2. They assert that the statutory word \"intended\" means that the product's maker has made an express claim about the effect that its product will have on the body. Ibid. Indeed, according to the companies, the FDA's inability to prove that cigarette manufacturers make such claims is precisely why that agency historically has said it lacked the statutory power to regulate tobacco.

      "The FDCA, however, does not use the word \"claimed\"; it uses the word \"intended.\" And the FDA long ago issued regulations that say the relevant \"intent\" can be shown not only by a manufacturer's \"expressions,\" but also \"by the circumstances surrounding the distribution of the article.\" 41 Fed. Reg. 6896 (1976) (codified at 21 CFR § 801.4 (1999)); see also 41 Fed.

Thus, even in the absence of express claims, the FDA has regulated products that affect the body if the manufacturer wants, and knows, that consumers so use the product. See, e.g., 60 Fed. Reg. 41527-41531 (1995) (describing agency's regulation of topical hormones, sunscreens, fluoride, tanning lamps, thyroid in food supplements, novelty condoms-all marketed without express claims); see also O'Reilly, Food and Drug Administration §13.04, at 13-15 (\"Sometimes the very nature of the material makes it a drug --\").\n",

The companies, in an effort to argue the former, point to language in the legislative history tying the word \"intended\" to a technical concept called \"intended use.\" But nothing in Congress' discussion either of \"intended\" or \"intended use\" suggests that an express claim (which often shows intent) is always necessary. Indeed, the primary statement to which the companies direct our attention says only that a manufacturer can determine what kind of regulation applies-\"food\" or \"drug\"-because, \"through his representations in connection with its sale, [the manufacturer] can determine\" whether an article is to be used as a \"food,\" as a \"drug,\" or as \"both.\" S.

And the companies acknowledge that the FDA can regulate a drug-like substance in the ordinary circumstance, i.e., where the manufacturer makes an express claim, so it is not unreasonable to conclude that the agency retains such power where a product's effects on the body are so well known (say, like those of aspirin or calamine lotion), that there is no need for express representations because the product speaks for itself.\n",

      "The companies also cannot deny that the evidence of their intent is sufficient to satisfy the statutory word \"intended\" as the FDA long has interpreted it. In the first place, there was once a time when they actually did make express advertising claims regarding tobacco's mood-stabilizing and weight-reducing properties-and historical representations can portend present expectations. In the late 1920's, for example, the American Tobacco Company urged weight-conscious smokers to \" 'Reach for a Lucky instead of a sweet.' \" Kluger, Ashes to Ashes, at 77-78. The advertisements of R J Reynolds (RJR) emphasized mood stability by depicting a pilot remarking that \" 'It Takes Steady Nerves To Fly the Mail At Night -- . That's why I smoke Camels. And I smoke plenty!' \" Id., at 86. RJR also advertised the stimulating quality of cigarettes, stating in one instance that \" 'You get a Lift with a Camel,' \" and, in another, that Camels are \" 'A Harmless Restoration of the Flow of Natural Body Energy.' \" Id., at 87. And claims of medical proof of mildness (and of other beneficial effects) once were commonplace. See, e.g., id., at 93 (Brown & Williamson advertised Kool-brand mentholated cigarettes as \"a tonic to hot, tired throats\"); id., at 101, 131 (Phillip Morris contended that \"[r]ecognized laboratory tests have conclusively proven the advantage of Phillip Morris\"); id., at 88 (RJR proclaimed \" 'For Digestion's sake, smoke Camels! -- Camels make mealtime more pleasant-digestion is stimulated-alkalinity increased' \").

      "The majority nonetheless reaches the \"inescapable conclusion\" that the language and structure of the FDCA as a whole \"simply do not fit\" the kind of public health problem that tobacco creates. Ante, at 20. That is because, in the majority's view, the FDCA requires the FDA to ban outright \"dangerous\" drugs or devices (such as cigarettes); yet, the FDA concedes that an immediate and total cigarette-sale ban is inappropriate. Ibid.\n",

      "106\n",
      "This argument is curious because it leads with similarly \"inescapable\" force to precisely the opposite conclusion, namely, that the FDA does have jurisdiction but that it must ban cigarettes. More importantly, the argument fails to take into account the fact that a statute interpreted as requiring the FDA to pick a more dangerous over a less dangerous remedy would be a perverse statute, causing, rather than preventing, unnecessary harm whenever a total ban is likely the more dangerous response. And one can at least imagine such circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "107\n",
      "Suppose, for example, that a commonly used, mildly addictive sleeping pill (or, say, a kind of popular contact lens), plainly within the FDA's jurisdiction, turned out to pose serious health risks for certain consumers. Suppose further that many of those addicted consumers would ignore an immediate total ban, turning to a potentially more dangerous black-market substitute, while a less draconian remedy (say, adequate notice) would wean them gradually away to a safer product. Would the FDCA still force the FDA to impose the more dangerous remedy? For the following reasons, I think not.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "108\n",
      "First, the statute's language does not restrict the FDA's remedial powers in this way. The FDCA permits the FDA to regulate a \"combination product\"-i.e., a \"device\" (such as a cigarette) that contains a \"drug\" (such as nicotine)- under its \"device\" provisions. 21 U.S.C. § 353(g)(1). And the FDCA's \"device\" provisions explicitly grant the FDA wide remedial discretion. For example, where the FDA cannot \"otherwise\" obtain \"reasonable assurance\" of a device's \"safety and effectiveness,\" the agency may restrict by regulation a product's \"sale, distribution, or use\" upon \"such -- conditions as the Secretary may prescribe. §360j(e)(1) (emphasis added). And the statutory section that most clearly addresses the FDA's power to ban (entitled \"Banned devices\") says that, where a device presents \"an unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury,\" the Secretary \"may\"-not must-\"initiate a proceeding -- to make such device a banned device.\" §360f(a) (emphasis added).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "109\n",
      "The Court points to other statutory subsections which it believes require the FDA to ban a drug or device entirely, even where an outright ban risks more harm than other regulatory responses. See ante, at 12-13. But the cited provisions do no such thing. It is true, as the majority contends, that \"the FDCA requires the FDA to place all devices\" in \"one of three classifications\" and that Class III devices require \"premarket approval.\" Ante, at 12, 13. But it is not the case that the FDA must place cigarettes in Class III because tobacco itself \"present[s] a potential unreasonable risk of illness or injury.\" 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(1)(C). In fact, Class III applies only where regulation cannot otherwise \"provide reasonable assurance of -- safety.\" §§360c(a)(1)(A), 360c(a)(1)(B) (placing a device in Class I or Class II when regulation can provide that assurance). Thus, the statute plainly allows the FDA to consider the relative, overall \"safety\" of a device in light of its regulatory alternatives, and where the FDA has chosen the least dangerous path, i.e., the safest path, then it can-and does-provide a \"reasonable assurance\" of \"safety\" within the meaning of the statute. A good football helmet provides a reasonable assurance of safety for the player even if the sport itself is still dangerous. And the safest regulatory choice by definition offers a \"reasonable\" assurance of safety in a world where the other alternatives are yet more dangerous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "110\n",
      "In any event, it is not entirely clear from the statute's text that a Class III categorization would require the FDA affirmatively to withdraw from the market dangerous devices, such as cigarettes, which are already widely distributed. See, e.g., §360f(a) (when a device presents an \"unreasonable and substantial risk of illness or injury,\" the Secretary \"may\" make it \"a banned device\"); §360h(a) (when a device \"presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public health,\" the Secretary \"may\" require \"notification\"); §360h(b) (when a defective device creates an \"unreasonable risk\" of harm, the Secretary \"may\" order \"repair, replacement, or refund\"); cf. O'Reilly, Food and Drug Administration §18.08, at 18-38 (point of Class III \"premarket approval\" is to allow \"careful scientific review\" of each \"truly new\" device \"before it is exposed\" to users (emphasis added)).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "111\n",
      "Noting that the FDCA requires banning a \"misbranded\" drug, the majority also points to 21 U.S.C. § 352(j), which deems a drug or device \"misbranded\" if \"it is dangerous to health when used\" as \"prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling.\" See ante, at 12. In addition, the majority mentions §352(f)(1), which calls a drug or device \"misbranded\" unless \"its labeling bears . . . adequate directions for use\" as \"are necessary for the protection of users.\" Ibid. But this \"misbranding\" language is not determinative, for it permits the FDA to conclude that a drug or device is not \"dangerous to health\" and that it does have \"adequate\" directions when regulated so as to render it as harmless as possible. And surely the agency can determine that a substance is comparatively \"safe\" (not \"dangerous\") whenever it would be less dangerous to make the product available (subject to regulatory requirements) than suddenly to withdraw it from the market. Any other interpretation risks substantial harm of the sort that my sleeping pill example illustrates. See supra, at 14. And nothing in the statute prevents the agency from adopting a view of \"safety\" that would avoid such harm. Indeed, the FDA already seems to have taken this position when permitting distribution of toxic drugs, such as poisons used for chemotherapy, that are dangerous for the user but are not deemed \"dangerous to health\" in the relevant sense. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44413 (1996).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "112\n",
      "The tobacco companies point to another statutory provision which says that if a device \"would cause serious, adverse health consequences or death, the Secretary shall issue\" a cease distribution order. 21 U.S.C. § 360h(e)(1) (emphasis added). But that word \"shall\" in this context cannot mean that the Secretary must resort to the recall remedy whenever a device would have serious, adverse health effects. Rather, that language must mean that the Secretary \"shall issue\" a cease distribution order in compliance with the section's procedural requirements if the Secretary chooses in her discretion to use that particular subsection's recall remedy. Otherwise, the subsection would trump and make meaningless the same section's provision of other lesser remedies such as simple \"notice\" (which the Secretary similarly can impose if, but only if, she finds that the device \"presents an unreasonable risk of substantial harm to the public\"). §360h(a)(1). And reading the statute to compel the FDA to \"recall\" every dangerous device likewise would conflict with that same subsection's statement that the recall remedy \"shall be in addition to [the other] remedies provided\" in the statute. §360h(e)(3) (emphasis added).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "113\n",
      "The statute's language, then, permits the agency to choose remedies consistent with its basic purpose-the overall protection of public health.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "114\n",
      "The second reason the FDCA does not require the FDA to select the more dangerous remedy, see supra, at 14, is that, despite the majority's assertions to the contrary, the statute does not distinguish among the kinds of health effects that the agency may take into account when assessing safety. The Court insists that the statute only permits the agency to take into account the health risks and benefits of the \"product itself\" as used by individual consumers, ante, at 17, and, thus, that the FDA is prohibited from considering that a ban on smoking would lead many smokers to suffer severe withdrawal symptoms or to buy possibly stronger, more dangerous, black market cigarettes-considerations that the majority calls \"the aggregate health effects of alternative administrative actions.\" Ibid. But the FDCA expressly permits the FDA to take account of comparative safety in precisely this manner. See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. § 360h(e)(2)(B)(i)(II) (no device recall if \"risk of recal[l]\" presents \"a greater health risk than\" no recall); §360h(a) (notification \"unless\" notification \"would present a greater danger\" than \"no such notification\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "115\n",
      "Moreover, one cannot distinguish in this context between a \"specific\" health risk incurred by an individual and an \"aggregate\" risk to a group. All relevant risk is, at bottom, risk to an individual; all relevant risk attaches to \"the product itself\"; and all relevant risk is \"aggregate\" in the sense that the agency aggregates health effects in order to determine risk to the individual consumer. If unregulated smoking will kill 4 individuals out of a typical group of 1,000 people, if regulated smoking will kill 1 out of 1,000, and if a smoking ban (because of the black market) will kill 2 out of 1,000; then these three possibilities means that in each group four, one, and two individuals, on average, will die respectively. And the risk to each individual consumer is 4/1000, 1/1000, and 2/1000 respectively. A \"specific\" risk to an individual consumer and \"aggregate\" risks are two sides of the same coin; each calls attention to the same set of facts. While there may be a theoretical distinction between the risk of the product itself and the risk related to the presence or absence of an intervening voluntary act (e.g., the search for a replacement on the black market), the majority does not rely upon any such distinction, and the FDA's history of regulating \"replacement\" drugs such as methadone shows that it has long taken likely actual alternative consumer behavior into account.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "116\n",
      "I concede that, as a matter of logic, one could consider the FDA's \"safety\" evaluation to be different from its choice of remedies. But to read the statute to forbid the agency from taking account of the realities of consumer behavior either in assessing safety or in choosing a remedy could increase the risks of harm-doubling the risk of death to each \"individual user\" in my example above. Why would Congress insist that the FDA ignore such realities, even if the consequent harm would occur only unusually, say, where the FDA evaluates a product (a sleeping pill; a cigarette; a contact lens) that is already on the market, potentially habit forming, or popular? I can find no satisfactory answer to this question. And that, I imagine, is why the statute itself says nothing about any of the distinctions that the Court has tried to draw. See 21 U.S.C. § 360c(a)(2) (instructing FDA to determine the safety and effectiveness of a \"device\" in part by weighing \"any probable benefit to health -- against any probable risk of injury or illness --\") (emphasis added).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "117\n",
      "Third, experience counsels against an overly rigid interpretation of the FDCA that is divorced from the statute's overall health-protecting purposes. A different set of words, added to the FDCA in 1958 by the Delaney Amendment, provides that \"no [food] additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found [after appropriate tests] to induce cancer in man or animal.\" §348(c)(3). The FDA once interpreted this language as requiring it to ban any food additive, no matter how small the amount, that appeared in any food product if that additive was ever found to induce cancer in any animal, no matter how large a dose needed to induce the appearance of a single carcinogenic cell. See H. R. Rep. No. 95-658, p. 7 (1977) (discussing agency's view). The FDA believed that the statute's ban mandate was absolute and prevented it from establishing a level of \"safe use\" or even to judge whether \"the benefits of continued use outweigh the risks involved.\" Id., at 5. This interpretation-which in principle could have required the ban of everything from herbal teas to mushrooms-actually led the FDA to ban saccharine, see 42 Fed. Reg. 19996 (1977), though this extremely controversial regulatory response never took effect because Congress enacted, and has continually renewed, a law postponing the ban. See Saccharin Study and Labeling Act, Pub. L. 95-203, §3, 91 Stat. 1452; e.g., Pub. L. 102-142, Tit. VI, 105 Stat. 910.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "118\n",
      "The Court's interpretation of the statutory language before us risks Delaney-type consequences with even less linguistic reason. Even worse, the view the Court advances undermines the FDCA's overall health-protecting purpose by placing the FDA in the strange dilemma of either banning completely a potentially dangerous drug or device or doing nothing at all. Saying that I have misunderstood its conclusion, the majority maintains that the FDA \"may clearly regulate many 'dangerous' products without banning them.\" Ante, at 19. But it then adds that the FDA must ban-rather than otherwise regulate-a drug or device that \"cannot be used safely for any therapeutic purpose.\" Ibid. If I misunderstand, it is only because this linchpin of the majority's conclusion remains unexplained. Why must a widely-used but unsafe device be withdrawn from the market when that particular remedy threatens the health of many and is thus more dangerous than another regulatory response? It is, indeed, a perverse interpretation that reads the FDCA to require the ban of a device that has no \"safe\" therapeutic purpose where a ban is the most dangerous remedial alternative.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "119\n",
      "In my view, where linguistically permissible, we should interpret the FDCA in light of Congress' overall desire to protect health. That purpose requires a flexible interpretation that both permits the FDA to take into account the realities of human behavior and allows it, in appropriate cases, to choose from its arsenal of statutory remedies. A statute so interpreted easily \"fit[s]\" this, and other, drug- and device-related health problems.\n",

      "In the majority's view, laws enacted since 1965 require us to deny jurisdiction, whatever the FDCA might mean in their absence. But why? Do those laws contain language barring FDA jurisdiction? The majority must concede that they do not. Do they contain provisions that are inconsistent with the FDA's exercise of jurisdiction? With one exception, see infra, at 24, the majority points to no such provision. Do they somehow repeal the principles of law (discussed in Part II, supra) that otherwise would lead to the conclusion that the FDA has jurisdiction in this area? The companies themselves deny making any such claim. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27 (denying reliance on doctrine of \"partial repeal\"). Perhaps the later laws \"shape\" and \"focus\" what the 1938 Congress meant a generation earlier. Ante, at 20. But this Court has warned against using the views of a later Congress to construe a statute enacted many years before. See Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 650 (1990) (later history is \" 'a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier' Congress\" (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960))). And, while the majority suggests that the subsequent history \"control[s] our construction\" of the FDCA, see ante, at 20 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), this Court expressly has held that such subsequent views are not \"controlling.\" Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 87-88, n. 4 (1968); accord, Southwestern Cable Co., 392 U.S., at 170 (such views have \" 'very little, if any, significance' \"); see also Sullivan v. Finkelstein, 496 U.S. 617, 632 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring) (\"Arguments based on subsequent legislative history -- should not be taken seriously, not even in a footnote.\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "121\n",
      "Regardless, the later statutes do not support the majority's conclusion. That is because, whatever individual Members of Congress after 1964 may have assumed about the FDA's jurisdiction, the laws they enacted did not embody any such \"no jurisdiction\" assumption. And one cannot automatically infer an antijurisdiction intent, as the majority does, for the later statutes are both (and similarly) consistent with quite a different congressional desire, namely, the intent to proceed without interfering with whatever authority the FDA otherwise may have possessed. See, e.g., Cigarette Labeling and Advertising-1965: Hearings on H. R. 2248 et al. before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 19 (1965) (hereinafter 1965 Hearings) (statement of Rep. Fino that the proposed legislation would not \"erode\" agency authority). As I demonstrate below, the subsequent legislative history is critically ambivalent, for it can be read either as (a) \"ratif[ying]\" a no-jurisdiction assumption, see ante, at 34, or as (b) leaving the jurisdictional question just where Congress found it. And the fact that both inferences are \"equally tenable,\" Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., supra, at 650 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara Cty., 480 U.S. 616, 672 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting), prevents the majority from drawing from the later statutes the firm, antijurisdiction implication that it needs.\n",

      "Consider, for example, Congress' failure to provide the FDA with express authority to regulate tobacco-a circumstance that the majority finds significant. See ante, at 21, 24-25, 32-33. But cf. Southwestern Cable Co., supra, at 170 (failed requests do not prove agency \"did not already possess\" authority). In fact, Congress both failed to grant express authority to the FDA when the FDA denied it had jurisdiction over tobacco and failed to take that authority expressly away when the agency later asserted jurisdiction. See, e.g., S. 1262, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §906 (1995) (failed bill seeking to amend FDCA to say that \"[n]othing in this Act or any other Act shall provide the [FDA] with any authority to regulate in any manner tobacco or tobacco products\"); see also H. R. 516, 105th Cong., 1st Sess., §2 (1997) (similar); H. R. Res. 980, reprinted in 142 Cong. Rec. 5018 (1996) (Georgia legislators unsuccessfully requested that Congress \"rescind any action giving the FDA authority\" over tobacco); H. R. 2283, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. (1995) (failed bill \"[t]o prohibit the [FDA] regulation of the sale or use of tobacco\"); H. R. 2414, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., §2(a) (1995) (similar). Consequently, the defeat of various different proposed jurisdictional changes proves nothing. This history shows only that Congress could not muster the votes necessary either to grant or to deny the FDA the relevant authority. It neither favors nor disfavors the majority's position.\n",

      "The majority also mentions the speed with which Congress acted to take jurisdiction away from other agencies once they tried to assert it. See ante, at 22, 26-29. But such a congressional response again proves nothing. On the one hand, the speedy reply might suggest that Congress somehow resented agency assertions of jurisdiction in an area it desired to reserve for itself-a consideration that supports the majority. On the other hand, Congress' quick reaction with respect to other agencies' regulatory efforts contrasts dramatically with its failure to enact any responsive law (at any speed) after the FDA asserted jurisdiction over tobacco more than three years ago.

      "In addition, at least one post-1938 statute reveals quite a different congressional intent than the majority infers. See Note following 21 U.S.C. § 321 (1994 ed., Supp. III) (FDA Modernization Act of 1997) (law \"shall [not] be construed to affect the question of whether the [FDA] has any authority to regulate any tobacco product,\" and \"[s]uch authority, if any, shall be exercised under the [FDCA] as in effect on the day before the date of [this] enactment\"). Consequently, it appears that the only interpretation that can reconcile all of the subsequent statutes is the inference that Congress did not intend, either explicitly or implicitly, for its later laws to answer the question of the scope of the FDA's jurisdictional authority. See 143 Cong. Rec. S8860 (Sept. 5, 1997) (the Modernization Act will \"not interfere or substantially negatively affect any of the FDA tobacco authority\").\n",

      "The majority's historical perspective also appears to be shaped by language in the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA), 79 Stat. 282, 15 U.S.C. § 1331 et seq.

      "The FCLAA has an express pre-emption provision which says that \"[n]o statement relating to smoking and health, other than the statement required by [this Act], shall be required on any cigarette package.\" §1334(a). This pre-emption clause plainly prohibits the FDA from requiring on \"any cigarette package\" any other \"statement relating to smoking and health,\" but no one contends that the FDA has failed to abide by this prohibition. See, e.g., 61 Fed. Reg. 44399 (1996) (describing the other regulatory prescriptions). Rather, the question is whether the FCLAA's pre-emption provision does more. Does it forbid the FDA to regulate at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "128\n",
      "This Court has already answered that question expressly and in the negative. See Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.S. 504 (1992). Cipollone held that the FCLAA's pre-emption provision does not bar state or federal regulation outside the provision's literal scope. Id., at 518. And it described the pre-emption provision as \"merely prohibit[ing] state and federal rulemaking bodies from mandating particular cautionary statements on cigarette labels -- .\" Ibid.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "129\n",
      "This negative answer is fully consistent with Congress' intentions in regard to the pre-emption language. When Congress enacted the FCLAA, it focused upon the regulatory efforts of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), not the FDA. See 1965 Hearings 1-2. And the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969, Pub. L. 91-222, §7(c), 84 Stat. 89, expressly amended the FCLAA to provide that \"[n]othing in this Act shall be construed to affirm or deny the [FTC's] holding that it has the authority to issue trade regulation rules\" for tobacco. See also H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 91-897, p. 7 (1970) (statement of House Managers) (we have \"no intention to resolve the question as to whether\" the FTC could regulate tobacco in a different way); see also 116 Cong. Rec. 7921 (1970) (statement of Rep. Satterfield) (same). Why would one read the FCLAA's pre-emption clause-a provision that Congress intended to limit even in respect to the agency directly at issue-so broadly that it would bar a different agency from engaging in any other cigarette regulation at all? The answer is that the Court need not, and should not, do so. And, inasmuch as the Court already has declined to view the FCLAA as pre-empting the entire field of tobacco regulation, I cannot accept that that same law bars the FDA's regulatory efforts here.\n",

Notwithstanding the views voiced by various legislators, Congress itself has addressed expressly the issue of the FDA's tobacco-related authority only once-and, as I have said, its statement was that the statute was not to \"be construed to affect the question of whether the [FDA] has any authority to regulate any tobacco product.\" Note following 21 U.S.C. § 321 (1994 ed., Supp. III).

      "Until the early 1990's, the FDA expressly maintained that the 1938 statute did not give it the power that it now seeks to assert. It then changed its mind. The majority agrees with me that the FDA's change of positions does not make a significant legal difference. See ante, at 34; see also Chevron, 467 U.S., at 863 (\"An initial agency interpretation is not instantly carved in stone\"); accord, Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N. A., 517 U.S. 735, 742 (1996) (\"[C]hange is not invalidating\"). Nevertheless, it labels those denials \"important context\" for drawing an inference about Congress' intent. Ante, at 34.

      "\n",
      "133\n",
      "When it denied jurisdiction to regulate cigarettes, the FDA consistently stated why that was so. In 1963, for example, FDA administrators wrote that cigarettes did not satisfy the relevant FDCA definitions-in particular, the \"intent\" requirement-because cigarette makers did not sell their product with accompanying \"therapeutic claims.\" Letter to Directors of Bureaus, Divisions and Directors of Districts from FDA Bureau of Enforcement (May 24, 1963), in Public Health Cigarette Amendments of 1971: Hearings on S. 1454 before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, 92d Cong., 2d Sess., 240 (1972) (hereinafter FDA Enforcement Letter). And subsequent FDA Commissioners made roughly the same assertion. One pointed to the fact that the manufacturers only \"recommended\" cigarettes \"for smoking pleasure.\" Two others reiterated the evidentiary need for \"health claims.\" Yet another stressed the importance of proving \"intent,\" adding that \"[w]e have not had sufficient evidence\" of \"intent with regard to nicotine.\" See, respectively, id., at 239 (Comm'r Edwards); Letter of Dec. 5, 1977, App. 47 (Comm'r Kennedy); 1965 Hearings 193 (Comm'r Rankin); 1994 Hearings 28 (Comm'r Kessler). Tobacco company counsel also testified that the FDA lacked jurisdiction because jurisdiction \"depends on -- intended use,\" which in turn \"depends, in general, on the claims and representations made by the manufacturer.\" Health Consequences of Smoking: Nicotine Addiction, Hearing before the Subcommittee on Health and the Environment of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., 288 (1988) (testimony of Richard Cooper) (emphasis added).\n",

      "\n",
      "134\n",
      "Other agency statements occasionally referred to additional problems. Commissioner Kessler, for example, said that the \"enormous social consequences\" flowing from a decision to regulate tobacco counseled in favor of obtaining specific Congressional \"guidance.\" 1994 Hearings 69; see also ante, at 31 (quoting statement of Health and Human Services Secretary Brandt to the effect that Congress wanted to make the relevant jurisdictional decision). But a fair reading of the FDA's denials suggests that the overwhelming problem was one of proving the requisite manufacturer intent. See Action on Smoking and Health v. Harris, 655 F.2d 236, 238-239 (CADC 1980) (FDA \"comments\" reveal its \"understanding\" that \"the crux of FDA jurisdiction over drugs lay in manufacturers' representations as revelatory of their intent\").\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "135\n",
      "What changed? For one thing, the FDA obtained evidence sufficient to prove the necessary \"intent\" despite the absence of specific \"claims.\" See supra, at 12-14. This evidence, which first became available in the early 1990's, permitted the agency to demonstrate that the tobacco companies knew nicotine achieved appetite-suppressing, mood-stabilizing, and habituating effects through chemical (not psychological) means, even at a time when the companies were publicly denying such knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "136\n",
      "Moreover, scientific evidence of adverse health effects mounted, until, in the late 1980's, a consensus on the seriousness of the matter became firm. That is not to say that concern about smoking's adverse health effects is a new phenomenon. See, e.g., Higginson, A New Counterblast, in Out-door Papers 179, 194 (1863) (characterizing tobacco as \" 'a narcotic poison of the most active class' \"). It is to say, however, that convincing epidemiological evidence began to appear mid-20th century; that the First Surgeon General's Report documenting the adverse health effects appeared in 1964; and that the Surgeon General's Report establishing nicotine's addictive effects appeared in 1988. At each stage, the health conclusions were the subject of controversy, diminishing somewhat over time, until recently-and only recently-has it become clear that there is a wide consensus about the health problem. See 61 Fed. Reg. 44701-44706 (1996).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "137\n",
      "Finally, administration policy changed. Earlier administrations may have hesitated to assert jurisdiction for the reasons prior Commissioners expressed. See supra, at 27-28. Commissioners of the current administration simply took a different regulatory attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "138\n",
      "Nothing in the law prevents the FDA from changing its policy for such reasons. By the mid-1990's, the evidence needed to prove objective intent-even without an express claim-had been found. The emerging scientific consensus about tobacco's adverse, chemically induced, health effects may have convinced the agency that it should spend its resources on this important regulatory effort. As for the change of administrations, I agree with then-Justice Rehnquist's statement in a different case, where he wrote:\n",

      "\"The agency's changed view -- seems to be related to the election of a new President of a different political party. It is readily apparent that the responsible members of one administration may consider public resistance and uncertainties to be more important than do their counterparts in a previous administration. A change in administration brought about by the people casting their votes is a perfectly reasonable basis for an executive agency's reappraisal of the costs and benefits of its programs and regulations. As long as the agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess administrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration.\" Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

      "One might nonetheless claim that, even if my interpretation of the FDCA and later statutes gets the words right, it lacks a sense of their \"music.\" See Helvering v. Gregory, 69 F.2d 809, 810-811 (CA2 1934) (L. Hand, J.) (\"[T]he meaning of a [statute] may be more than that of the separate words, as a melody is more than the notes --\"). Such a claim might rest on either of two grounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "141\n",
      "First, one might claim that, despite the FDA's legal right to change its mind, its original statements played a critical part in the enactment of the later statutes and now should play a critical part in their interpretation. But the FDA's traditional view was largely premised on a perceived inability to prove the necessary statutory \"intent\" requirement. See, e.g., FDA Enforcement Letter 240 (\"The statutory basis for the exclusion of tobacco products from FDA's jurisdiction is the fact that tobacco marketed for chewing or smoking without accompanying therapeutic claims, does not meet the definitions -- for food, drug, device or cosmetic\"). The statement, \"we cannot assert jurisdiction over substance X unless it is treated as a food\" would not bar jurisdiction if the agency later establishes that substance X is, and is intended to be, eaten. The FDA's denials of tobacco-related authority sufficiently resemble this kind of statement that they should not make the critical interpretive difference.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "142\n",
      "Second, one might claim that courts, when interpreting statutes, should assume in close cases that a decision with \"enormous social consequences,\" 1994 Hearings 69, should be made by democratically elected Members of Congress rather than by unelected agency administrators. Cf. Kent v. Dulles, 357 U.S. 116, 129 (1958) (assuming Congress did not want to delegate the power to make rules interfering with exercise of basic human liberties). If there is such a background canon of interpretation, however, I do not believe it controls the outcome here.\n",

      "143\n",
      "Insofar as the decision to regulate tobacco reflects the policy of an administration, it is a decision for which that administration, and those politically elected officials who support it, must (and will) take responsibility. And the very importance of the decision taken here, as well as its attendant publicity, means that the public is likely to be aware of it and to hold those officials politically accountable. Presidents, just like Members of Congress, are elected by the public. Indeed, the President and Vice President are the only public officials whom the entire Nation elects. I do not believe that an administrative agency decision of this magnitude-one that is important, conspicuous, and controversial-can escape the kind of public scrutiny that is essential in any democracy. And such a review will take place whether it is the Congress or the Executive Branch that makes the relevant decision.\n",

Reg. 44704 (1996) (citing Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Cigarette Smoking Among Adults-United States, 1993; 43 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report 929 (Dec. 23, 1994)). The fact that only a handful of those who try to quit smoking actually succeed illustrates a certain reality-the reality that the nicotine in cigarettes creates a powerful physiological addiction flowing from chemically induced changes in the brain. The FDA has found that the makers of cigarettes \"intend\" these physical effects. Hence, nicotine is a \"drug\"; the cigarette that delivers nicotine to the body is a \"device\"; and the FDCA's language, read in light of its basic purpose, permits the FDA to assert the disease-preventing jurisdiction that the agency now claims.\n",

      "The majority also believes that subsequently enacted statutes deprive the FDA of jurisdiction. But the later laws say next to nothing about the FDA's tobacco-related authority. Previous FDA disclaimers of jurisdiction may have helped to form the legislative atmosphere out of which Congress' own tobacco-specific statutes emerged. But a legislative atmosphere is not a law, unless it is embodied in a statutory word or phrase.

      "A general court-martial found petitioner Loving, an Army private, guilty  of both premeditated murder and felony murder under Article 118 of the  Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 918(1),  (4). Finding three aggravating factors-(1) that the premeditated murder  was committed during a robbery, Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM)  the premeditated murder, had committed a second murder, also proved at  his single trial, RCM 1004(c)(7)(J)-the court-martial sentenced Loving  to death. The commander who convened the court-martial approved the findings and sentence.  The United States Army Court of Military Review  and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed,  rejecting Loving's attack on the promulgation by Executive Order of the  aggravating factors in RCM 1004.  He contends that the Eighth Amendment  and the separation-of-powers doctrine require that Congress, not the  President, make the fundamental policy determination respecting the  factors that warrant the death penalty.\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "1.  On the assumption that Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and  subsequent cases apply to this crime and sentence, the Constitution  requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges.  Under the  Eighth Amendment, the military capital sentencing scheme must genuinely  narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must  reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the  accused compared to others found guilty of murder, see, e.g., Lowenfield  v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244.  That narrowing is not achieved in the statute.  Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the  four types of murder therein specified, premeditated and felony murder,  Section(s) 918(1), (4), whereas intentional murder without premeditation  and murder resulting from wanton and dangerous conduct are not  punishable by death, Section(s) 918(2), (3).  Moreover, Article 118(4)  by its terms permits the death penalty for felony murder even if the  accused had no intent to kill and did not do the killing himself.  Because the Eighth Amendment does not permit death to be imposed in  those circumstances, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801, additional aggravating factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to  Article 118's constitutional validity, see, e.g., Lowenfield, supra, at  244.  Pp. 5-6.\n",
      "2.  The President's prescription of the challenged aggravating factors  did not violate the separation-of-powers principle.  Pp. 6-25.\n",
      "(a) The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine, a strand of this  Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence, is that the lawmaking  function belongs to Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 1, and  may not be conveyed to another branch or entity, Field v. Clark, 143 U.  S. 649, 692.  This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress  can make a rule of prospective force.  Although it may not delegate the  power to make the law, which necessarily involves discretion as to what the law shall be, Congress may delegate to others the authority or discretion to execute the law under and in pursuance of its terms. Id.,  at 693-694. Pp. 6-10.\n",
      "(b)  The Court rejects Loving's argument that Congress lacks power to  delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors  in capital murder cases.  An analysis of English constitutional history  and of the historical necessities and events that instructed the Framers  demonstrates that U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 8, cl. 14-which  empowers Congress \"[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of  the land and naval forces\"-does not grant an exclusive, nondelegable  power to determine military punishments, but gives Congress such flexibility to exercise or share power as the times might demand. And  it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander in  Chief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion and authority.  Thus, in the circumstances presented here, Congress may delegate  authority to the President to define the aggravating factors that permit  imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations providing the  narrowing of the death-eligible class that the Eighth Amendment  requires.  Pp. 10-19.\n",
      "(c) Also rejected is Loving's contention that, even if Congress can delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating  factors, Congress did not do so by implicit or explicit action in this  instance.  In fact, Congress exercised that power of delegation in 1950,  when it enacted Articles 18, 56, and 36(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C.  Section(s) 818 (A court-martial \"may, under such limitations as the  President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the  UCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically authorized\"), 856 (\"The punishment which a court-martial may direct . . . may not  exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense\"),  and 836(a) (which empowers the President to make procedural rules for  courtsmartial, and was identified by Congress in 1985 as a source of  Presidential authority to provide capital aggravating factors).  Together, these Articles give clear authority to the President to  promulgate RCM 1004.  Pp. 20-22.\n",
      "(d) Loving's final assertion-that even if Articles 18, 56, and 36 can be  construed as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle to guide  the President's discretion-is also rejected. Had the delegations here  called for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the  President's traditional authority, this argument might have more weight.  However, because the President's duties as Commander in Chief require  him to take responsible and continuing action to superintend the  military, including the courts-martial, the delegated duty to prescribe aggravating factors for capital cases is interlinked with duties already  assigned to him by the Constitution's express terms.  The same  limitations on delegation do not apply where the entity exercising the  delegated authority possesses independent authority over the subject  matter.  See, e.g., United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557.  Pp. 22-25.\n",

(Congress reenacted the Articles in 1790 \"as far as the same  may be applicable to the constitution of the United States,\" Act of Apr.  30, 1790, ch. 10, Section(s) 13, 1 Stat. 121).  The Articles adopted by  the First Congress placed significant restrictions on court-martial  jurisdiction over capital offenses.  Although the death penalty was  authorized for 14 military offenses, American Articles of War of 1776,  reprinted in W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 961 (reprint 2d  ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop); Allred, Comment, Rocks and Shoals in a  Sea of Otherwise Deep Commitment: General Court-Martial Size and Voting  Requirements, 35 Nav. L. Rev. 153, 156-158 (1986), the Articles followed  the British example of ensuring the supremacy of civil court  jurisdiction over ordinary capital crimes that were punishable by the  law of the land and were not special military offenses.  1776 Articles,  Section(s) 10, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 964 (requiring commanders,  upon application, to exert utmost effort to turn offender over to civil authorities).  Cf. British Articles of War of 1765, Section(s) 11, Art.  1, reprinted in Winthrop 937 (same). That provision was deemed  protection enough for soldiers, and in 1806 Congress debated and  rejected a proposal to remove the death penalty from court-martial  jurisdiction.

      "Over the next two centuries, Congress expanded court-martial jurisdiction.  In 1863, concerned that civil courts could not function  in all places during hostilities, Congress granted courts-martial  jurisdiction of common-law capital crimes and the authority to impose  the death penalty in wartime.  Act of Mar. 3, 1863, Section(s) 30, 12  Stat. 736, Rev. Stat. Section(s) 1342, Art. 58 (1875); Coleman v.  Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 514 (1879). In 1916, Congress granted to the  military courts a general jurisdiction over common-law felonies  committed by service members, except for murder and rape committed  within the continental United States during peacetime.  Articles of War  of 1916, ch. 418, Section(s) 3, Arts. 92-93, 39 Stat. 664.  Persons accused of the latter two crimes were to be turned over to the civilian  authorities.  Art. 74, 39 Stat. 662.  In 1950, with the passage of the  UCMJ, Congress lifted even this restriction. Article 118 of the UCMJ  describes four types of murder subject to court-martial jurisdiction,  two of which are punishable by death:\n",

      "\"is guilty of murder, and shall suffer such punishment as a court-martial may direct, except that if found guilty under clause (1)  or (4), he shall suffer death or imprisonment for life as a court-martial may direct.\"  10 U. S. C. Section(s) 918.\n",

      "So matters stood until 1983, when the CMA confronted a challenge  to the constitutionality of the military capital punishment scheme in  light of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), and our ensuing death  penalty jurisprudence.  Although it held valid most of the death penalty  procedures followed in courts-martial, the court found one fundamental  defect: the failure of either the UCMJ or the RCM to require that court-martial members \"specifically identify the aggravating factors  upon which they have relied in choosing to impose the death penalty.\"  United States v. Matthews, 16 M. J. 354, 379. The Court reversed  Matthews' death sentence, but ruled that either Congress or the  President could remedy the defect and that the new procedures could be  applied retroactively.  16 M. J., at 380-382.\n",

      "The President responded to Matthews in 1984 with an Executive Order promulgating RCM 1004.  In conformity with 10 U. S. C. Section(s)  852(a)(1), the Rule, as amended, requires a unanimous finding that the  accused was guilty of a capital offense before a death sentence may be  imposed, RCM 1004(a)(2).  The Rule also requires unanimous findings (1)  that at least one  aggravating factor is present and (2) that any  extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighed by  any admissible aggravating circumstances, 1004(b).  RCM 1004(c)  enumerates 11 categories of aggravating factors sufficient for  imposition of the death penalty.  The Rule also provides that the  accused is to have \"broad latitude to present evidence in extenuation  and mitigation,\" 1004(b)(3), and is entitled to have the members of the  court-martial instructed to consider all such evidence before deciding  upon a death sentence, 1004(b)(6).\n",

      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "A preliminary question in this case is whether the Constitution  requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges.  The Government  does not contest the application of our death penalty jurisprudence to  courts-martial, at least in the context of a conviction under Article  118 for murder committed in peacetime within the United States, and we  shall assume that Furman and the case law resulting from it are applicable to the crime and sentence in question.  Cf. Trop v. Dulles,  356 U. S. 86 (1958) (analyzing court-martial punishments under the  Eighth Amendment).  The Eighth Amendment requires, among other things,  that \"a capital sentencing scheme must `genuinely narrow the class of  persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the  imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others  found guilty of murder.'\"  Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988) (quoting Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)).  Some schemes accomplish that narrowing by requiring that the sentencer find  at least one aggravating circumstance.  Ibid.  The narrowing may also be  achieved, however, in the definition of the capital offense, in which  circumstance the requirement that the sentencer \"find the existence of  an aggravating circumstance in addition is no part of the  constitutionally required narrowing process.\" Id., at 246.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "Although the Government suggests the contrary, Brief for United  States 11, n. 6, we agree with Loving, on the assumption that Furman  applies to this case, that aggravating factors are necessary to the  constitutional validity of the military capital-punishment scheme as now  enacted. Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the  four types of murder specified: premeditated and felony murder are  punishable by death, 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 918(1), (4), whereas  intentional murder without premeditation and murder resulting from  wanton and dangerous conduct are not, Section(s) 918(2), (3).  The  statute's selection of the two types of murder for the death penalty, however, does not narrow the death-eligible class in a way consistent  with our cases.  Article 118(4) by its terms permits death to be imposed  for felony murder even if the accused had no intent to kill and even if  he did not do the killing himself. The Eighth Amendment does not permit  the death penalty to be imposed in those circumstances.  Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801 (1982).  As a result, additional aggravating  factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to save Article  118.  We turn to the question whether it violated the principle of  separation of powers for the President to prescribe the aggravating  factors required by the Eighth Amendment.\n",

See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farms, 514 U.  S. ___, ___ (1995) (slip op., at 14-15) (Congress may not revise  judicial determinations by retroactive legislation reopening judgments); Bowsher v.

Article I's precise rules of representation,  member qualifications, bicameralism, and voting procedure make Congress  the branch most capable of responsive and deliberative lawmaking.  See  Chadha, supra, at 951.  Ill suited to that task are the Presidency,  designed for the prompt and faithful execution of the laws and its own  legitimate powers, and the Judiciary, a branch with tenure and authority  independent of direct electoral control.

      "Another strand of our separation-of-powers jurisprudence, the delegation doctrine, has developed to prevent Congress from forsaking  its duties.  Loving invokes this doctrine to question the authority of  the President to promulgate RCM 1004.  The fundamental precept of the  delegation doctrine is that the lawmaking function belongs to Congress,  U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 1, and may not be conveyed to another  branch or entity.  Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892).  This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress can make a rule of  prospective force.  To burden Congress with all federal rulemaking would  divert that branch from more pressing issues, and defeat the Framers'  design of a workable National Government. Thomas Jefferson observed,  \"Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in a great assembly as  the details of execution.\"  5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 319 (P. Ford ed.  1904) (Letter to E. Carrington, Aug. 4, 1787).  See also A. L. A.  Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 529-530 (1935) (recognizing \"the necessity of adapting legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the national legislature cannot deal directly\").

He presses his constitutional challenge on three fronts.  First, he argues that Congress cannot delegate to the President the  authority to prescribe aggravating factors in capital murder cases.  Second, he contends that, even if it can, Congress did not delegate the  authority by implicit or explicit action.  Third, Loving believes that  even if certain statutory provisions can be construed as delegations,  they lack an intelligible principle to guide the President's discretion.  Were Loving's premises to be accepted, the President would lack authority to prescribe aggravating factors in RCM 1004, and the death  sentence imposed upon him would be unconstitutional.\n",

      "Loving's first argument is that Congress lacks power to allow the President to prescribe aggravating factors in military capital cases  because any delegation would be inconsistent with the Framers' decision  to vest in Congress the power \"To make Rules for the Government and  Regulation of the land and naval forces.\" U. S. Const., Art. I,  Section(s) 8, cl. 14.  At least in the context of capital punishment for  peacetime crimes, which implicates the Eighth Amendment, this power must  be deemed exclusive, Loving contends.  In his view, not only is the determination of aggravating factors a quintessential policy judgment  for the legislature, but the history of military capital punishment in  England and America refutes a contrary interpretation.  He asserts that  his offense was not tried in a military court throughout most of English  and American history. It is this historical exclusion of common-law  capital crimes from military jurisdiction, he urges, which must inform  our understanding of whether Clause 14 reserves to Congress the power to  prescribe what conduct warrants a death sentence, even if it permits  Congress to authorize courts-martial to try such crimes. See Brief for  Petitioner 42-43; Brief for United States Navy-Marine Corps Appellate  Defense Division as Amicus Curiae 7-12, 19-26.  Mindful of the  historical dangers of autocratic military justice and of the limits  Parliament set on the peacetime jurisdiction of courts-martial over  capital crimes in the first Mutiny Act, 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5 (1689), and  having experienced the military excesses of the Crown in colonial  America, the Framers harbored a deep distrust of executive military  power and military tribunals.  See Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-24 (1957) (plurality); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228, 232 (1959).  It follows, Loving says, that the Framers intended that Congress alone  should possess the power to decide what aggravating factors justify  sentencing a member of the armed forces to death.\n",

      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "We have undertaken before, in resolving other issues, the difficult task of interpreting Clause 14 by drawing upon English constitutional history.  See, e.g., Reid, supra, at 23-30; O'Callahan v.  Parker, 395 U. S. 258, 268-272 (1969) (determining that courts-martial  only had jurisdiction of service-connected crimes); Solorio v. United  States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987) (overruling O'Callahan and taking  issue with its historical analysis).  Doing so here, we find that,  although there is a grain of truth in Loving's historical arguments, the  struggle of Parliament to control military tribunals and the lessons the Framers drew from it are more complex than he suggests.  The history  does not require us to read Clause 14 as granting to Congress an  exclusive, nondelegable power to determine military punishments.  If  anything, it appears that England found security in divided authority,  with Parliament at times ceding to the Crown the task of fixing military  punishments.  From the English experience the Framers understood the  necessity of balancing efficient military discipline, popular control of  a standing army, and the rights of soldiers; they perceived the risks inherent in assigning the task to one part of the government to the  exclusion of another; and they knew the resulting parliamentary practice  of delegation.  The Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress  the same flexibility to exercise or share power as times might demand.\n",

The rudiments of law in English military  justice can first be seen in the written orders issued by the King for  various expeditions.  Winthrop 17-18.  For example, in 1190 Richard I  issued an ordinance outlining six offenses to which the crusaders would  be subject, including two punishable by death: \"Whoever shall slay a man  on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man and thrown into the  sea. If he shall slay him on land he shall be bound to the dead man and buried in the earth.\"  Ordinance of Richard I-A.D. 1190, reprinted in  id., at 903.  The first comprehensive articles of war were those  declared by Richard II at Durham in 1385 and Henry V at Mantes in 1419,  which decreed capital offenses that not only served military discipline  but also protected foreign noncombatants from the ravages of war.

Articles of War, sometimes issued by military commanders acting under royal commission in the ensuing centuries, Winthrop 19, were not fixed codes, at least through  the 17th century; rather, \"each war, each expedition, had its own  edict,\" which lost force after the cessation of hostilities and the  disbanding of the army that had been formed.

Military justice was brought  under the rule of parliamentary law in 1689, when William and Mary  accepted the Bill of Rights requiring Parliament's consent to the  raising and keeping of armies.  In the Mutiny Act of 1689, Parliament declared the general principle that \"noe Man may be forejudged of Life  or Limbe or subjected to any kinde of punishment by Martiall Law or in  any other manner then by the Judgment of his Peeres and according to the  knowne and Established Laws of this Realme,\" but decreed that \"Soldiers  who shall Mutiny or stirr up Sedition or shall desert Their Majestyes  Service be brought to a more Exemplary and speedy Punishment than the  usuall Forms of Law will allow,\" and \"shall suffer Death or such other  Punishment as by a Court-Martiall shall be Inflicted.\" 1 Wm.

A strong line of demarcation  must therefore be drawn between the soldiers and the rest of the  community.

In 1713, it gave statutory sanction to the Crown's longstanding practice  of issuing Articles of War without limiting the kind of punishments that  might be imposed; and, in the same Act, it delegated the power to \"erect  and constitute Courts Martial with Power to try hear and determine any  Crime or Offence by such Articles of War  and inflict Penalties by  Sentence or Judgement in any of Her Majesties Dominions beyond the Seas  or elsewhere beyond the Seas (except in the Kingdom of Ireland) . . . as  might have been done by Her Majesties Authority beyond the Seas in Time of War.\"  12 Anne, ch. 13, Section(s) 43; Winthrop 20.  Cf. Duke & Vogel, supra, at 444 (noting that Parliament in 1803 gave statutory  authority to the Crown to promulgate Articles of War applicable to  troops stationed in England as well).

      "As Loving contends, and as we have explained elsewhere, the Framers well knew this history, and had encountered firsthand the abuses  of military law in the colonies.  See Reid, 354 U. S., at 27-28.  As  many were themselves veterans of the Revolutionary War, however, they  also knew the imperatives of military discipline.  What they distrusted  were not courts-martial per se, but military justice dispensed by a  commander unchecked by the civil power in proceedings so summary as to  be lawless. The latter was the evil that caused Blackstone to declare  that \"martial law\" -- by which he, not observing the modern distinction between military and martial law, meant decrees of courts-martial disciplining soldiers in wartime -- \"is built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, [and] is, as Sir  Matthew Hale observes, in truth and reality no law, but something  indulged rather than allowed as a law.\"  1 Blackstone's Commentaries  *413.  See also Hale, History of the Common Law of England, at 26-27;  Clode 21 (military law in early seventeenth century England amounted to  \"the arbitrary right to punish or destroy, without legal trial, any  assumed delinquent\").  The partial security Englishmen won against such  abuse in 1689 was to give Parliament, preeminent guardian of the British  constitution, primacy in matters of military law.  This fact does not  suggest, however, that a legislature's power must be exclusive.  It was for Parliament, as it did in the various Mutiny Acts, to designate as  the times required what peacetime offenses by soldiers deserved the  punishment of death; and it was for Parliament, as it did in 1713, to  delegate the authority to define wartime offenses and devise their  punishments, including death.  The Crown received the delegated power  and the concomitant responsibility for its prudent exercise.  The lesson  from the English constitutional experience was that Parliament must have the primary power to regulate the armed forces and to determine the  punishments that could be imposed upon soldiers by courts-martial.  That  was not inconsistent, however, with the further power to divide  authority between it and the Crown as conditions might warrant.\n",

This power is no less plenary than other Article I powers,  Solorio, supra, at 441, and we discern no reasons why Congress should  have less capacity to make measured and appropriate delegations of this  power than of any other, see Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.  S. 212, 220-221 (1989) (Congress may delegate authority under the taxing  power); cf. Lichter v. United States, 334 U.

Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981).  And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander in Chief to hold  that he may not be given wide discretion and authority.

Solorio, supra, at 450-451 (Congress may extend court-martial  jurisdiction to any criminal offense committed by a service member  during his period of service).  It further declared the law that service  members who commit premeditated and felony murder may be sentenced to  death by a court-martial.

      "Having held that Congress has the power of delegation, we further hold that it exercised the power in Articles 18 and 56 of the  UCMJ.  Article 56 specifies that \"[t]he punishment which a court-martial  may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President  may prescribe for that offense.\"  10 U. S. C. Section(s) 856.  Article  18 states that a court-martial \"may, under such limitations as the  President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the  UCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by\"  the Code. Section(s) 818.  As the Court of Military Appeals pointed out  in Curtis, for some decades the President has used his authority under  these Articles to increase the penalties for certain noncapital offenses  if aggravating circumstances are present. For example, by regulation,  deserters who are apprehended are punished more severely than those who  surrender; drunk drivers suffer a harsher fate if they cause an accident  resulting in the death of a victim; and the punishment of thieves is  graded by the value of the stolen goods.  See Curtis, 32 M. J., at 261.  The President has thus provided more precision in sentencing than is provided by the statute, while remaining within statutory bounds. This  past practice suggests that Articles 18 and 56 support as well an  authority in the President to restrict the death sentence to murders in  which certain aggravating circumstances have been established.\n",

      "Although the language of Article 36 seems further afield from capital aggravating factors than that of Article 18 or 56, it is the  provision that a later Congress identified as the source of Presidential  authority to prescribe these factors.  In 1985, Congress enacted Article  106(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 906a, which authorized the  death penalty for espionage.  The Article requires a finding of an  aggravating factor if the accused is to be sentenced to death; it  enumerates three such factors, but allows death to be decreed on \"[a]ny other factor that may be prescribed by the President by regulations  under section 836 of this title (article 36).\" Section(s) 906(a)(c)(4).  Article 106a itself, then, is premised on the President's having  authority under Article 36 to prescribe capital aggravating factors, and  \"`[s]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is  entitled to great weight in statutory construction.'\"  Consumer Product  Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980),  quoting Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969).

In  1950, he argues, Congress could not have understood that it was giving  the President the authority to bring an otherwise invalid capital murder  statute in line with Eighth Amendment strictures.  Perhaps so, but  Furman did not somehow undo the prior delegation.  What would have been an act of leniency by the President prior to Furman may have become a  constitutional necessity thereafter, see supra, at 5-6, but the fact  remains the power to prescribe aggravating circumstances has resided  with the President since 1950.\n",

United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928); Touby, 500 U. S., at  165.  The intelligible-principle rule seeks to enforce the understanding that Congress  may not delegate the power to make laws and so may delegate no more than the authority to make policies and rules that  implement its statutes.  Field, 143 U. S., at 693-694. Though in 1935  we struck down two delegations for lack of an intelligible principle, A.  L. A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), and  Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we have since upheld,  without exception, delegations under standards phrased in sweeping  terms.

S.  190, 216-217, 225-226 (1943) (upholding delegation to the Federal Communications Commission to regulate radio broadcasting according to  \"public interest, convenience, or necessity\").  Had the delegations here  called for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the  traditional authority of the President, Loving's last argument that  Congress failed to provide guiding principles to the President might  have more weight.  We find no fault, however, with the delegation in  this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "In United States v. Curtis, the Court of Military Appeals discerned a principle limiting the President's discretion to define  aggravating factors for capital crimes in Article 36: namely, the  directive that regulations the President prescribes must \"apply the  principles of law . . . generally recognized in the trial of criminal  cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be  contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter,\" 10 U. S. C. Section(s)  836(a).  We think, however, that the question to be asked is not whether  there was any explicit principle telling the President how to select  aggravating factors, but whether any such guidance was needed, given the nature of the delegation and the officer who is to exercise the delegated authority.  First, the delegation is set within boundaries the  President may not exceed.  Second, the delegation here was to the  President in his role as Commander in Chief. Perhaps more explicit  guidance as to how to select aggravating factors would be necessary if  delegation were made to a newly created entity without independent  authority in the area.  Cf. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 374-379 (upholding  delegation to the United States Sentencing Commission because of  detailed congressional directives channeling agency discretion).  The President's duties as Commander in Chief, however, require him to take  responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, including  the courts-martial.  The delegated duty, then, is interlinked with  duties already assigned to the President by express terms of the  Constitution, and the same limitations on delegation do not apply \"where  the entity exercising the delegated authority itself possesses  independent authority over the subject matter,\" United States v.  Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557 (1975).  See also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319-322 (1936).  Cf. Swaim  v. United States, 165 U. S. 553, 557-558 (1897) (President has inherent  authority to convene courts-martial).  Like the Court of Military  Appeals, Curtis, 32 M. J., at 263, n. 9, we need not decide whether the  President would have inherent power as Commander in Chief to prescribe  aggravating factors in capital cases.  Once delegated that power by  Congress, the President, acting in his constitutional office of  Commander in Chief, had undoubted competency to prescribe those factors  without further guidance.  \"The military constitutes a specialized  community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,\" Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953), and the President can be  entrusted to determine what limitations and conditions on punishments  are best suited to preserve that special discipline.\n",

It  would be contradictory to say that Congress cannot further empower him  to limit by prospective regulation the circumstances in which  courtsmartial can impose a death sentence.

To be sure, there is  ample precedent in our cases for looking to the history of English  courts-martial -- but not where the question is of the sort before us  today.  We have surveyed that history for the purpose of establishing  the permissible scope of the jurisdiction of military tribunals over certain classes of defendants and offenses, see, e.g., Solorio v. United  States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228,  232 (1959); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-27 (1957) (plurality); see  also Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 745 (1974).  This case does not  present such a question.  Petitioner does not assert that tradition  establishes his offense to be, in its nature, beyond the jurisdiction of  military courts, or that courts-martial are historically incapable of  adjudicating capital offenses.  His arguments are altogether different:  that Congress cannot authorize the President to establish \"aggravating  factors\" designed to carry out the narrowing function that (we assume)  is necessary for imposition of a capital sentence; and that, even if Congress can give the President authority to perform this function, such  authorization has not been effected by the statutes upon which the  Government relies.\n",

Our written Constitution does not  require us to trace out that history; it provides, in straightforward  fashion, that \"The Congress shall have Power . . . To make Rules for the  Government and Regulation of the land and naval forces,\" U. S. Const.,  Art.

I would leave this historical  discussion aside.  While it is true, as the Court demonstrates, that the  scheme of assigned responsibility here conforms to English practices,  that is so not because Clause 14 requires such conformity, but simply because what seemed like a good arrangement to Parliament has seemed  like a good arrangement to Congress as well.\n",

While it  has become the practice in our opinions to refer to \"unconstitutional  delegations of legislative authority\" versus \"lawful delegations of  legislative authority,\" in fact the latter category does not exist.  Legislative power is nondelegable. Congress can no more \"delegate\" some  of its Article I power to the Executive than it could \"delegate\" some to  one of its committees.  What Congress does is to assign responsibilities  to the Executive; and when the Executive undertakes those assigned responsibilities it acts, not as the \"delegate\" of Congress, but as the  agent of the People.  At some point the responsibilities assigned can  become so extensive and so unconstrained that Congress has in effect  delegated its legislative power; but until that point of excess is  reached there exists, not a \"lawful\" delegation, but no delegation at  all.\n",

Mindful of the factors  that \"differentiate military society from civilian society,\" we have concluded that the Constitution permits Congress \"to legislate both with  greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules  by which the former shall be governed than it is when prescribing rules  for the latter.\"  Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974).  This  heightened deference extends not only to congressional action but also  to executive action by the President, who by virtue of his constitutional role as Commander in Chief, see U. S. Const, Art. II,  Section(s) 2, cl. 1, possesses shared authority over military discipline.  See Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 510 (1975) (\"The  responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces shall attend to  th[e] business [of fighting or preparing to fight wars] rests with  Congress and with the President\") (citations omitted).  See also Brown  v. Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 360 (1980) (\"Both Congress and this Court have  found that the special character of the military requires civilian  authorities to accord military commanders some flexibility in dealing  with matters that affect internal discipline and morale.  In construing  a statute that touches on such matters, therefore, courts must be  careful not to `circumscribe the authority of military commanders to an extent never intended by Congress'\") (citations omitted).  Under these  and many similar cases reviewing legislative and executive control of  the military, the sentencing scheme at issue in this case, and the  manner in which it was created, are constitutionally unassailable.\n",

      "On a separate point, I agree with Justice Scalia that the majority's extended analysis of the division of authority between the  English Parliament and the Crown with regard to regulation of the  military, see ante, at 10-17, has no relevance to this case. It is true  that we frequently consult English history and common law in attempting  to determine the content of constitutional provisions, but the majority  fails to cite a single separation-of-powers case in which we have relied  on the structure of the English Government in attempting to understand the governmental structure erected by the Framers of the Constitution.  Nor does the majority cite any historical evidence, whether from the  constitutional debates, the Federalist Papers, or some other source,  that demonstrates that the Framers sought to embrace, or at least  actively considered, the English system of shared power over the  military.  If the majority pointed to some basis for conducting the  inquiry that it does, I might be willing to accept its analysis.  Instead, the majority repeatedly substitutes ipse dixit for historical  evidence.  See, e.g., ante, at 11 (\"From the English experience the  Framers . . . knew the . . . parliamentary practice of delegation\" and  \"[t]he Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress the same  flexibility to exercise or share power\"); ante, at 16 (\"the Framers well  knew this history\"); ante, at 17 (\"The historical necessities and events  of the English constitutional experience . . . were familiar to [the  Framers] and inform our understanding of the purpose and meaning of  constitutional provisions\").  I have no doubt that the Framers were well  versed in English history.  But it is too simplistic for purposes of  constitutional analysis to draw conclusions about the allocation of  constitutional author-ity among the branches of the United States  Government from mere speculation about the Framers' familiarity with  English military history and the significance that they attached to it.\n",

      "Section 109(a) of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator to promulgate national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for each air pollutant for which \"air quality criteria\" have been issued under 108. Pursuant to 109(d)(1), the Administrator in 1997 revised the ozone and particulate matter NAAQS. Respondents in No. 99-1257, private parties and several States (hereinafter respondents), challenged the revised NAAQS on several grounds. The District of Columbia Circuit found that, under the Administrator's interpretation, 109(b)(1)-which instructs the EPA to set standards \"the attainment and maintenance of which ... are requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety\"-delegated legislative power to the Administrator in contravention of the Federal Constitution, and it remanded the NAAQS to the EPA. The Court of Appeals also declined to depart from its rule that the EPA may not consider implementation costs in setting the NAAQS. And it held that, although certain implementation provisions for the ozone NAAQS contained in Part D, Subpart 2, of Title I of the CAA did not prevent the EPA from revising the ozone standard and designating certain areas as \"nonattainment areas,\" those provisions, rather than more general provisions contained in Subpart 1, constrained the implementation of the new ozone NAAQS. The court rejected the EPA's argument that it lacked jurisdiction to reach the implementation question because there had been no \"final\" implementation action.\n",
      "Held:  1. Section 109(b) does not permit the Administrator to consider implementation costs in setting NAAQS. Because the CAA often expressly grants the EPA the authority to consider implementation costs, a provision for costs will not be inferred from its ambiguous provisions. Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 257, and n. 5. And since 109(b)(1) is the engine that drives nearly all of Title I of the CAA, the textual commitment of costs must be clear; Congress does not alter a regulatory scheme's fundamental details in vague terms or ancillary provisions, see MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231. Respondents' arguments founder upon this principle. It is implausible that 109(b)(1)'s modest words \"adequate margin\" and \"requisite\" give the EPA the power to determine whether implementation costs should moderate national air quality standards. Cf. ibid. And the cost factor is both so indirectly related to public health and so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would have been expressly mentioned in 108 and 109 had Congress meant it to be considered. Other CAA provisions, which do require cost data, have no bearing upon whether costs are to be taken into account in setting the NAAQS. Because the text of 109(b)(1) in its context is clear, the canon of construing texts to avoid serious constitutional problems is not applicable. See, e.g., Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341. Pp. 4-11.\n",
      "2. Section 109(b)(1) does not delegate legislative power to the EPA. When conferring decisionmaking authority upon agencies, Congress must lay down an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to act is directed to conform. J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409. An agency cannot cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute. The limits that 109(b)(1) imposes on the EPA's discretion are strikingly similar to the ones approved in, e.g., Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. 160, and the scope of discretion that 109(b)(1) allows is well within the outer limits of the Court's nondelegation precedents, see, e.g., Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388. Statutes need not provide a determinate criterion for saying how much of a regulated harm is too much to avoid delegating legislative power. Pp. 11-15.\n",
      "3. The Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the implementation issue under 307 of the CAA. The implementation policy constitutes final agency action under 307 of the CAA because it marked the consummation of the EPA's decisionmaking process, see Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154. The decision is also ripe for review. The question is purely one of statutory interpretation that would not benefit from further factual development, see Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, 523 U.S. 726, 733; review will not interfere with further administrative development; and the hardship on respondent States in developing state implementation plans satisfies the CAA's special judicial-review provision permitting preenforcement review, see id., at 737. The implementation issue was also fairly included within the challenges to the final ozone rule that were before the Court of Appeals, which all parties agree is final agency action ripe for review. Pp. 16-20.\n",
      "4. The implementation policy is unlawful. Under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, if the statute resolves the question whether Subpart 1 or Subpart 2 applies to revised ozone NAAQS, that ends the matter; but if the statute is ambiguous, the Court must defer to a reasonable agency interpretation. Here, the statute is ambiguous concerning the interaction between Subpart 1 and Subpart 2, but the Court cannot defer to the EPA's interpretation, which would render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion nugatory once a new ozone NAAQS has been promulgated. The principal distinction between the subparts is that Subpart 2 eliminates regulatory discretion allowed by Subpart 1. The EPA may not construe the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit its discretion. In addition, although Subpart 2 was obviously written to govern implementation for some time into the future, nothing in the EPA's interpretation would have prevented the agency from aborting the subpart the day after it was enacted. It is left to the EPA to develop a reasonable interpretation of the nonattainment implementation provisions insofar as they apply to revised ozone NAAQS. Pp. 20-25.\n",

EPA, 175 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1999). The court thought, however, that the EPA could perhaps avoid the unconstitutional delegation by adopting a restrictive construction of 109(b)(1), so instead of declaring the section unconstitutional the court remanded the NAAQS to the agency. Id., at 1038. (On this delegation point, Judge Tatel dissented, finding the statute constitutional as written. Id., at 1057.) On the second issue that the Court of Appeals addressed, it unanimously rejected respondents' argument that the court should depart from the rule of Lead Industries Assn., Inc. v.

The court held that although Subpart 2 constrained the agency's method of implementing the new standard, 175 F.3d, at 1050, it did not prevent the EPA from revising the standard and designating areas of the country as \"nonattainment areas,\" see 42 U.S.C.  7407(d)(1), by reference to it, 175 F.3d, at 1047-1048.

      "Section 109(b)(1) instructs the EPA to set primary ambient air quality standards \"the attainment and maintenance of which ... are requisite to protect the public health\" with \"an adequate margin of safety.\" 42 U.S.C.  7409(b)(1). Were it not for the hundreds of pages of briefing respondents have submitted on the issue, one would have thought it fairly clear that this text does not permit the EPA to consider costs in setting the standards. The language, as one scholar has noted, \"is absolute.\" D. Currie, Air Pollution: Federal Law and Analysis 4-15 (1981). The EPA, \"based on\" the information about health effects contained in the technical \"criteria\" documents compiled under 108(a)(2), 42 U.S.C.  7408(a)(2), is to identify the maximum airborne concentration of a pollutant that the public health can tolerate, decrease the concentration to provide an \"adequate\" margin of safety, and set the standard at that level. Nowhere are the costs of achieving such a standard made part of that initial calculation.\n",

      "9\n",
      "Against this most natural of readings, respondents make a lengthy, spirited, but ultimately unsuccessful attack. They begin with the object of 109(b)(1)'s focus, the \"public health.\" When the term first appeared in federal clean air legislation-in the Act of July 14, 1955 (1955 Act), 69 Stat. 322, which expressed \"recognition of the dangers to the public health\" from air pollution-its ordinary meaning was \"[t]he health of the community.\" Webster's New International Dictionary 2005 (2d ed. 1950). Respondents argue, however, that 109(b)(1), as added by the Clean Air Amendments of 1970 (1970 Act), 84 Stat. 1676, meant to use the term's secondary meaning: \"[t]he ways and means of conserving the health of the members of a community, as by preventive medicine, organized care of the sick, etc.\" Ibid. Words that can have more than one meaning are given content, however, by their surroundings, FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 132-133 (2000); Jones v. United States, 527 U.S. 373, 389 (1999), and in the context of 109(b)(1) this second definition makes no sense. Congress could not have meant to instruct the Administrator to set NAAQS at a level \"requisite to protect\" \"the art and science dealing with the protection and improvement of community health.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1836 (1981). We therefore revert to the primary definition of the term: the health of the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "Even so, respondents argue, many more factors than air pollution affect public health. In particular, the economic cost of implementing a very stringent standard might produce health losses sufficient to offset the health gains achieved in cleaning the air-for example, by closing down whole industries and thereby impoverishing the workers and consumers dependent upon those industries. That is unquestionably true, and Congress was unquestionably aware of it. Thus, Congress had commissioned in the Air Quality Act of 1967 (1967 Act) \"a detailed estimate of the cost of carrying out the provisions of this Act; a comprehensive study of the cost of program implementation by affected units of government; and a comprehensive study of the economic impact of air quality standards on the Nation's industries, communities, and other contributing sources of pollution.\" 2, 81 Stat. 505. The 1970 Congress, armed with the results of this study, see The Cost of Clean Air, S. Doc. No. 91-40 (1969) (publishing the results of the study), not only anticipated that compliance costs could injure the public health, but provided for that precise exigency. Section 110(f)(1) of the CAA permitted the Administrator to waive the compliance deadline for stationary sources if, inter alia, sufficient control measures were simply unavailable and \"the continued operation of such sources is essential ... to the public health or welfare.\" 84 Stat. 1683 (emphasis added). Other provisions explicitly permitted or required economic costs to be taken into account in implementing the air quality standards. Section 111(b)(1)(B), for example, commanded the Administrator to set \"standards of performance\" for certain new sources of emissions that as specified in 111(a)(1) were to \"reflec[t] the degree of emission limitation achievable through the application of the best system of emission reduction which (taking into account the cost of achieving such reduction) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated.\" Section 202(a)(2) prescribed that emissions standards for automobiles could take effect only \"after such period as the Administrator finds necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period.\" 84 Stat. 1690. See also 202(b)(5)(C) (similar limitation for interim standards); 211(c)(2) (similar limitation for fuel additives); 231(b) (similar limitation for implementation of aircraft emission standards). Subsequent amendments to the CAA have added many more provisions directing, in explicit language, that the Administrator consider costs in performing various duties. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C.  7545(k)(1) (reformulate gasoline to \"require the greatest reduction in emissions ... taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emissions reductions\"); 7547(a)(3) (emission reduction for nonroad vehicles to be set \"giving appropriate consideration to the cost\" of the standards). We have therefore refused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly granted. See Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 U.S. 246, 257, and n. 5 (1976). Cf. General Motors Corp. v. United States, 496 U.S. 530, 538, 541 (1990) (refusing to infer in certain provisions of the CAA deadlines and enforcement limitations that had been expressly imposed elsewhere).\n",

      "Accordingly, to prevail in their present challenge, respondents must show a textual commitment of authority to the EPA to consider costs in setting NAAQS under 109(b)(1). And because 109(b)(1) and the NAAQS for which it provides are the engine that drives nearly all of Title I of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7401-7515, that textual commitment must be a clear one. Congress, we have held, does not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions-it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes. See MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., 512 U.S. 218, 231 (1994); FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., supra, at 159-160. Respondents' textual arguments ultimately founder upon this principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "Their first claim is that 109(b)(1)'s terms \"adequate margin\" and \"requisite\" leave room to pad health effects with cost concerns. Just as we found it \"highly unlikely that Congress would leave the determination of whether an industry will be entirely, or even substantially, rate-regulated to agency discretion-and even more unlikely that it would achieve that through such a subtle device as permission to 'modify' rate-filing requirements,\" MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph Co., supra, at 231, so also we find it implausible that Congress would give to the EPA through these modest words the power to determine whether implementation costs should moderate national air quality standards. Accord Christensen v. Harris County, 529 U.S. 576, 590, n. (2000) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"The implausibility of Congress's leaving a highly significant issue unaddressed (and thus 'delegating' its resolution to the administering agency) is assuredly one of the factors to be considered in determining whether there is ambiguity\" (emphasis deleted)).1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "The same defect inheres in respondents' next two arguments: that while the Administrator's judgment about what is requisite to protect the public health must be \"based on [the] criteria\" documents developed under 108(a)(2), see 109(b)(1), it need not be based solely on those criteria; and that those criteria themselves, while they must include \"effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air,\" are not necessarily limited to those effects. Even if we were to concede those premises, we still would not conclude that one of the unenumerated factors that the agency can consider in developing and applying the criteria is cost of implementation. That factor is both so indirectly related to public health and so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would surely have been expressly mentioned in 108 and 109 had Congress meant it to be considered. Yet while those provisions describe in detail how the health effects of pollutants in the ambient air are to be calculated and given effect, see 108(a)(2), they say not a word about costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "Respondents point, finally, to a number of provisions in the CAA that do require attainment cost data to be generated. Section 108(b)(1), for example, instructs the Administrator to \"issue to the States,\" simultaneously with the criteria documents, \"information on air pollution control techniques, which information shall include data relating to the cost of installation and operation.\" 42 U.S.C.  7408(b)(l). And 109(d)(2)(C)(iv) requires the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee to \"advise the Administrator of any adverse public health, welfare, social, economic, or energy effects which may result from various strategies for attainment and maintenance\" of NAAQS.2 42 U.S.C.  7409(d)(2)(C)(iv). Respondents argue that these provisions make no sense unless costs are to be considered in setting the NAAQS. That is not so. These provisions enable the Administrator to assist the States in carrying out their statutory role as primary implementers of the NAAQS. It is to the States that the Act assigns initial and primary responsibility for deciding what emissions reductions will be required from which sources. See 42 U.S.C.  7407(a), 7410 (giving States the duty of developing implementation plans). It would be impossible to perform that task intelligently without considering which abatement technologies are most efficient, and most economically feasible-which is why we have said that \"the most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan,\" Union Elec.

      "In a delegation challenge, the constitutional question is whether the statute has delegated legislative power to the agency. Article I, 1, of the Constitution vests \"[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted ... in a Congress of the United States.\" This text permits no delegation of those powers, Loving v. United States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996); see id., at 776-777 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and so we repeatedly have said that when Congress confers decisionmaking authority upon agencies Congress must \"lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.\" J. W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). We have never suggested that an agency can cure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by adopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the statute. Both Fahey v. Mallonee, 332 U.S. 245, 252-253 (1947), and Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 783 (1948), mention agency regulations in the course of their nondelegation discussions, but Lichter did so because a subsequent Congress had incorporated the regulations into a revised version of the statute, ibid., and Fahey because the customary practices in the area, implicitly incorporated into the statute, were reflected in the regulations. 332 U.S., at 250. The idea that an agency can cure an unconstitutionally standardless delegation of power by declining to exercise some of that power seems to us internally contradictory. The very choice of which portion of the power to exercise-that is to say, the prescription of the standard that Congress had omitted-would itself be an exercise of the forbidden legislative authority. Whether the statute delegates legislative power is a question for the courts, and an agency's voluntary self-denial has no bearing upon the answer.\n",

They also resemble the Occupational Safety and Health Act provision requiring the agency to \" 'set the standard which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible, on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer any impairment of health' \"-which the Court upheld in Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980), and which even then-Justice Rehnquist, who alone in that case thought the statute violated the nondelegation doctrine, see id., at 671 (opinion concurring in judgment), would have upheld if, like the statute here, it did not permit economic costs to be considered.

In the history of the Court we have found the requisite \"intelligible principle\" lacking in only two statutes, one of which provided literally no guidance for the exercise of discretion, and the other of which conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring \"fair competition.\" See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935); A. L. A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495 (1935). We have, on the other hand, upheld the validity of 11(b)(2) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 821, which gave the Securities and Exchange Commission authority to modify the structure of holding company systems so as to ensure that they are not \"unduly or unnecessarily complicate[d]\" and do not \"unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security holders.\" American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 104 (1946).

      "It is true enough that the degree of agency discretion that is acceptable varies according to the scope of the power congressionally conferred. See Loving v. United States, supra, at 772-773; United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 556-557 (1975). While Congress need not provide any direction to the EPA regarding the manner in which it is to define \"country elevators,\" which are to be exempt from new-stationary-source regulations governing grain elevators, see 7411(i), it must provide substantial guidance on setting air standards that affect the entire national economy. But even in sweeping regulatory schemes we have never demanded, as the Court of Appeals did here, that statutes provide a \"determinate criterion\" for saying \"how much [of the regulated harm] is too much.\" 175 F.3d, at 1034. In Touby, for example, we did not require the statute to decree how \"imminent\" was too imminent, or how \"necessary\" was necessary enough, or even-most relevant here-how \"hazardous\" was too hazardous. 500 U.S., at 165-167. Similarly, the statute at issue in Lichter authorized agencies to recoup \"excess profits\" paid under wartime Government contracts, yet we did not insist that Congress specify how much profit was too much. 334 U.S., at 783-786. It is therefore not conclusive for delegation purposes that, as respondents argue, ozone and particulate matter are \"nonthreshold\" pollutants that inflict a continuum of adverse health effects at any airborne concentration greater than zero, and hence require the EPA to make judgments of degree. \"[A] certain degree of discretion, and thus of lawmaking, inheres in most executive or judicial action.\" Mistretta v. United States, supra, at 417 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted); see 488 U.S., at 378-379 (majority opinion). Section 109(b)(1) of the CAA, which to repeat we interpret as requiring the EPA to set air quality standards at the level that is \"requisite\"-that is, not lower or higher than is necessary-to protect the public health with an adequate margin of safety, fits comfortably within the scope of discretion permitted by our precedent.\n",

L. 105-178, 6103, 112 Stat. 465 (setting timeline for new ozone designations), and it exposes them to additional restrictions over and above the implementation requirements imposed generally by 110 of the CAA. These additional restrictions are found in the five substantive subparts of Part D of Title I, 42 U.S.C.  7501-7515. Subpart 1, 7501-7509a, contains general nonattainment regulations that pertain to every pollutant for which a NAAQS exists. Subparts 2 through 5, 7511-7514a, contain rules tailored to specific individual pollutants. Subpart 2, added by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, 103, 104 Stat. 2423, addresses ozone. 42 U.S.C.  7511-7511f.

      "At the same time the EPA proposed the revised ozone NAAQS in 1996, it also proposed an \"interim implementation policy\" for the NAAQS, see 61 Fed. Reg. 65752 (1996), that was to govern until the details of implementation could be put in final form through specific \"rulemaking actions.\" The preamble to this proposed policy declared that \"the interim implementation policy ... represent[s] EPA's preliminary views on these issues and, while it may include various statements that States must take certain actions, these statements are made pursuant to EPA's preliminary interpretations, and thus do not bind the States and public as a matter of law.\" Ibid. If the EPA had done no more, we perhaps could accept its current claim that its action was not final. However, after the agency had accepted comments on its proposed policy, and on the same day that the final ozone NAAQS was promulgated, the White House published in the Federal Register what it titled a \"Memorandum for the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency\" that prescribed implementation procedures for the EPA to follow. 62 Fed. Reg. 38421 (1997). (For purposes of our analysis we shall assume that this memorandum was not itself action by the EPA.) The EPA supplemented this memorandum with an explanation of the implementation procedures, which it published in the explanatory preamble to its final ozone NAAQS under the heading, \"Final decision on the primary standard.\" Id., at 38873. \"In light of comments received regarding the interpretation proposed in the Interim Implementation Policy,\" the EPA announced, it had \"reconsidered that interpretation\" and settled on a new one. Ibid. The provisions of \"subpart 1 of part D of Title I of the Act\" will immediately \"apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour [ozone] standards.\" Ibid.; see also id., at 38885 (new standard to be implemented \"simultaneously [with the old standard] ... under the provisions of ... subpart 1\"). Moreover, the provisions of subpart 2 \"will [also] continue to apply as a matter of law for so long as an area is not attaining the [old] 1-hour standard.\" Id., at 38873.

      "We have little trouble concluding that this constitutes final agency action subject to review under 307. The bite in the phrase \"final action\" (which bears the same meaning in 307(b)(1) that it does under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) 5 U.S.C.  704 see Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 586 (1980)) is not in the word \"action,\" which is meant to cover comprehensively every manner in which an agency may exercise its power. See FTC v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal., 449 U.S. 232, 238, n. 7 (1980). It is rather in the word \"final,\" which requires that the action under review \"mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process.\" Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-178 (1997). Only if the \"EPA has rendered its last word on the matter\" in question, Harrison v. PPG Industries, Inc., supra, at 586, is its action \"final\" and thus reviewable. That standard is satisfied here. The EPA's \"decisionmaking process,\" which began with the 1996 proposal and continued with the reception of public comments, concluded when the agency, \"in light of [these comments],\" and in conjunction with a corresponding directive from the White House, adopted the interpretation of Part D at issue here. Since that interpretation issued, the EPA has refused in subsequent rulemakings to reconsider it, explaining to disappointed commenters that its earlier decision was conclusive. See 63 Fed. Reg. 31014, 31018-31019 (1998).

Nor will our review \"inappropriately interfere with further administrative action,\" ibid., since the EPA has concluded its consideration of the implementation issue. Finally, as for hardship to the parties: The respondent States must-on pain of forfeiting to the EPA control over implementation of the NAAQS-promptly undertake the lengthy and expensive task of developing state implementation plans (SIP's) that will attain the new, more stringent standard within five years. See 42 U.S.C.  7410 7502. Whether or not this would suffice in an ordinary case brought under the review provisions of the APA, see 5 U.S.C.  704 we have characterized the special judicial-review provision of the CAA, 42 U.S.C.  7607(b), as one of those statutes that specifically provides for \"preenforcement\" review, see Ohio Forestry Assn., Inc. v. Sierra Club, supra, at 737. Such statutes, we have said, permit \"judicial review directly, even before the concrete effects normally required for APA review are felt.\" Lujan v.

Brief for Industry Petitioners and Intervenors in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 32-34. The EPA responded that Subpart 2 did not supplant but simply supplemented Subpart 1, so that the latter section still \"applies to all nonattainment areas for all NAAQS, ... including nonattainment areas for any revised ozone standard.\" Final Brief for EPA in No. 97-1441 (and consolidated cases) (CADC), pp. 67-68.\n",

In other words, the EPA was arguing that the revised standard could be issued, despite its apparent incompatibility with portions of Subpart 2, because it would be implemented under Subpart 1 rather than Subpart 2. The District of Columbia Circuit ultimately agreed that Subpart 2 could be harmonized with the EPA's authority to promulgate revised NAAQS, but not because Subpart 2 is entirely inapplicable-which is one of EPA's assignments of error. It is unreasonable to contend, as the EPA now does, that the Court of Appeals was obligated to reach the agency's preferred result, but forbidden to assess the reasons the EPA had given for reaching that result.

Two sections of Subpart 1, 7502(a)(1)(C) and 7502(a)(2)(D), contain switching provisions stating that if the classification of ozone nonattainment areas is \"specifically provided [for] under other provisions of [Part D],\" then those provisions will control instead of Subpart 1's. Thus it is true but incomplete to note, as the Administrator does, that the substantive language of Subpart 1 is broad enough to apply to revised ozone standards. See, e.g., 7502(a)(1)(A) (instructing the Administrator to classify nonattainment areas according to \"any revised standard, including a revision of any standard in effect on November 15, 1990\"); 7502(a)(2)(A) (setting attainment deadlines). To determine whether that language does apply one must resolve the further textual issue whether some other provision, namely Subpart 2, provides for the classification of ozone nonattainment areas.

      "So, does Subpart 2 provide for classifying nonattainment ozone areas under the revised standard? It unquestionably does. The backbone of the subpart is Table 1, printed in 7511(a)(1) and reproduced in the margin here,5 which defines five categories of ozone nonattainment areas and prescribes attainment deadlines for each. Section 7511(a)(1) funnels all nonattainment areas into the table for classification, declaring that \"[e]ach area designated nonattainment for ozone ... shall be classified at the time of such designation, under table 1, by operation of law.\" And once an area has been classified, \"the primary standard attainment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date provided in table 1.\" The EPA argues that this text is not as clear or comprehensive as it seems, because the title of 7511(a) reads \"Classification and attainment dates for 1989 nonattainment areas,\" which suggests that Subpart 2 applies only to areas that were in nonattainment in 1989, and not to areas later designated nonattainment under a revised ozone standard. The suggestion must be rejected, however, because 7511(b)(1) specifically provides for the classification of areas that were in attainment in 1989 but have subsequently slipped into nonattainment. It thus makes clear that Subpart 2 is not limited solely to 1989 nonattainment areas. This eliminates the interpretive role of the title, which may only \"she[d] light on some ambiguous word or phrase in the statute itself,\" Carter v. United States, 530 U.S. 255, 267 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections v. Yeskey, 524 U.S., at 212, in turn quoting Trainmen v. Baltimore & Ohio R.

      "It may well be, as the EPA argues-and as the concurring opinion below on denial of rehearing pointed out, see 195 F.3d, at 11-12-that some provisions of Subpart 2 are ill fitted to implementation of the revised standard. Using the old 1-hour averages of ozone levels, for example, as Subpart 2 requires, see 7511(a)(1); 44 Fed. Reg. 8202 (1979), would produce at best an inexact estimate of the new 8-hour averages, see 40 CFR  50.10 and App. I (1999). Also, to the extent that the new ozone standard is stricter than the old one, see Reply Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 17 (\"the stricter 8-hour NAAQS\"); 62 Fed. Reg. 38856, 38858 (1997) (8-hour standard of 0.09 ppm rather than 0.08 ppm would have \"generally represent[ed] the continuation of the [old] level of protection\"), the classification system of Subpart 2 contains a gap, because it fails to classify areas whose ozone levels are greater than the new standard (and thus nonattaining) but less than the approximation of the old standard codified by Table 1. And finally, Subpart 2's method for calculating attainment dates-which is simply to count forward a certain number of years from November 15, 1990 (the date the 1990 CAA Amendments took force), depending on how far out of attainment the area started-seems to make no sense for areas that are first classified under a new standard after November 15, 1990. If, for example, areas were classified in the year 2000, many of the deadlines would already have expired at the time of classification.\n",

See FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S., at 132; INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424 (1999). We cannot defer, however, to the interpretation the EPA has given.\n",

      "Whatever effect may be accorded the gaps in Subpart 2 as implying some limited applicability of Subpart 1, they cannot be thought to render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion utterly nugatory once a new standard has been promulgated, as the EPA has concluded. The principal distinction between Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 is that the latter eliminates regulatory discretion that the former allowed. While Subpart 1 permits the EPA to establish classifications for nonattainment areas, Subpart 2 classifies areas as a matter of law based on a table. Compare 7502(a)(1) with 7511(a)(1) (Table 1). Whereas the EPA has discretion under Subpart 1 to extend attainment dates for as long as 12 years, under Subpart 2 it may grant no more than 2 years' extension. Compare 7502(a)(2)(A) and (C) with 7511(a)(5). Whereas Subpart 1 gives the EPA considerable discretion to shape nonattainment programs, Subpart 2 prescribes large parts of them by law. Compare 7502(c) and (d) with 7511a. Yet according to the EPA, Subpart 2 was simply Congress's \"approach to the implementation of the [old] 1-hour\" standard, and so there was no reason that \"the new standard could not simultaneously be implemented under ... subpart 1.\" 62 Fed. Reg. 38856, 38885 (1997); see also id., at 38873 (\"the provisions of subpart 1 ... would apply to the implementation of the new 8-hour ozone standards\"). To use a few apparent gaps in Subpart 2 to render its textually explicit applicability to nonattainment areas under the new standard utterly inoperative is to go over the edge of reasonable interpretation. The EPA may not construe the statute in a way that completely nullifies textually applicable provisions meant to limit its discretion.\n",

      "The EPA's interpretation making Subpart 2 abruptly obsolete is all the more astonishing because Subpart 2 was obviously written to govern implementation for some time. Some of the elements required to be included in SIP's under Subpart 2 were not to take effect until many years after the passage of the Act. See 7511a(e)(3) (restrictions on \"electric utility and industrial and commercial boiler[s]\" to be \"effective 8 years after November 15, 1990\"); 7511a(c)(5)(A) (vehicle monitoring program to \"[b]egi[n] 6 years after November 15, 1990\"); 7511a(g)(1) (emissions milestone requirements to be applied \"6 years after November 15, 1990, and at intervals of every 3 years thereafter\"). A plan reaching so far into the future was not enacted to be abandoned the next time the EPA reviewed the ozone standard-which Congress knew could happen at any time, since the technical staff papers had already been completed in late 1989. See 58 Fed. Reg. 13008, 13010 (1993); see also 42 U.S.C.  7409(d)(1) (NAAQS must be reviewed and, if appropriate, revised at least once every five years).\n",

      "Yet nothing in the EPA's interpretation would have prevented the agency from aborting Subpart 2 the day after it was enacted. Even now, if the EPA's interpretation were correct, some areas of the country could be required to meet the new, more stringent ozone standard in at most the same time that Subpart 2 had allowed them to meet the old standard. Compare 7502(a)(2) (Subpart 1 attainment dates) with 7511(a) (Subpart 2 attainment dates). Los Angeles, for instance, \"would be required to attain the revised NAAQS under Subpart 1 no later than the same year that marks the outer time limit for attaining Subpart 2's one-hour ozone standard.\" Brief for Petitioners in No. 99-1257, p. 49.

Likewise, while \"all written comments\" must be placed in the docket, 7607(d)(4)(B)(i), the EPA need respond only to the \"significant\" ones, 7407(d)(6)(B); comments regarding cost data are not significant if cost data are irrelevant.\n",

Those provisions do not purport to limit the authority of either recipient of power to delegate authority to others. See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 752 (1986) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment) (\"Despite the statement in Article I of the Constitution that 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States,' it is far from novel to acknowledge that independent agencies do indeed exercise legislative powers\"); INS v.

Surely the authority granted to members of the Cabinet and federal law enforcement agents is properly characterized as \"Executive\" even though not exercised by the President. Cf. Morrison v.

In order better to achieve regulatory goals-for example, to allocate resources so that they save more lives or produce a cleaner environment-regulators must often take account of all of a proposed regulation's adverse effects, at least where those adverse effects clearly threaten serious and disproportionate public harm.

It means that the relevant economic costs are speculative, for they include the cost of unknown future technologies. It also means that efforts to take costs into account can breed time-consuming and potentially unresolvable arguments about the accuracy and significance of cost estimates. Congress could have thought such efforts not worth the delays and uncertainties that would accompany them. In any event, that is what the statute's history seems to say.

As the majority points out, ante, at 6-7, the Act allows regulators to take those concerns into account when they determine how to implement ambient air quality standards. Thus, States may consider economic costs when they select the particular control devices used to meet the standards, and industries experiencing difficulty in reducing their emissions can seek an exemption or variance from the state implementation plan. See Union Elec., supra, at 266 (\"[T]he most important forum for consideration of claims of economic and technological infeasibility is before the state agency formulating the implementation plan\").\n",

And Congress can change those statutory limits if necessary. Given the ambient air quality standards' substantial effects on States, cities, industries, and their suppliers and customers, Congress will hear from those whom compliance deadlines affect adversely, and Congress can consider whether legislative change is warranted.

See Industrial Union Dept., AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, 448 U.S. 607, 642 (1980) (plurality opinion) (the word \"safe\" does not mean \"risk-free\"). Nor are the words \"requisite\" and \"public health\" to be understood independent of context. We consider football equipment \"safe\" even if its use entails a level of risk that would make drinking water \"unsafe\" for consumption. And what counts as \"requisite\" to protecting the public health will similarly vary with background circumstances, such as the public's ordinary tolerance of the particular health risk in the particular context at issue. The Administrator can consider such background circumstances when \"decid[ing] what risks are acceptable in the world in which we live.\" Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v.

      "The Clean Air Act's (CAA or Act) Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) program, 42 U.S.C. § 7477, was designed to ensure that the air quality in \"attainment areas,\" i.e., areas that are already \"clean,\" will not degrade, see § 7470(1). The program bars construction of any major air pollutant emitting facility not equipped with \"the best available control technology\" (BACT). § 7475(a)(4). The Act defines BACT as \"an emission limitation based on the maximum degree of [pollutant] reduction... which the [state] permitting authority, on a case-by-case basis, taking into account energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs, determines is achievable for [the] facility.\" § 7479(3). Two provisions of the Act vest enforcement authority in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency). Section 113(a)(5) generally authorizes the EPA, when it finds that a State is not complying with a CAA \"requirement\" governing construction of a pollutant source, to pursue remedial action, including issuance of \"an order prohibiting the construction.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7413(a). Directed specifically to the PSD program, CAA § 167 instructs EPA to \"take such measures, including issuance of an order.... as necessary to prevent the construction\" of a major pollutant emitting facility that does not conform to the \"requirements\" of the program. Because EPA has classified northwest Alaska, the region here at issue, as an attainment area for nitrogen dioxide, the PSD program applies to emissions of that pollutant in the region. No \"major emitting facility,\" including any source emitting more than 250 tons of nitrogen oxides per year, § 7479(1), may be constructed or modified unless a PSD permit has been issued for the facility, § 7475(a)(1). A PSD permit may not issue unless the proposed facility is subject to BACT for each CAA-regulated pollutant emitted from the facility. § 7475(a)(4).\n",
      "In this case, \"the permitting authority\" under § 7479(3) is Alaska, acting through petitioner, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). In 1988, Teck Cominco Alaska, Inc. (Cominco), obtained authorization to operate a zinc concentrate mine in northwest Alaska. The mine is a \"major emitting facility\" under § 7475. Its initial PSD permit authorized five diesel electric generators, MG-1 through MG-5, subject to operating restrictions. Under a second PSD permit issued in 1994, Cominco added a sixth generator, MG-6. In 1996, Cominco initiated a project to expand zinc production by 40% and applied to ADEC for a PSD permit to allow, inter alia, increased electricity generation by MG-5. ADEC preliminarily proposed as BACT for MG-5 an emission control technology known as selective catalytic reduction (SCR), which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions by 90%. Amending its application, Cominco added a seventh generator, MG-17, and proposed, as BACT, an alternative control technology — Low NOx — that achieves a 30% reduction in nitrogen oxide pollutants. In May 1999, ADEC issued a first draft PSD permit and preliminary technical analysis report, concluding that Low NOx was BACT for MG-5 and MG-17. ADEC identified SCR as the most stringent technology then technically and economically feasible. ADEC nevertheless endorsed Cominco's proffered emissions-offsetting alternative of fitting MG-17 and all six existing generators with Low NOx, rather than fitting MG-5 and MG-17 with SCR. This proposal, ADEC submitted, would achieve, a maximum NOx reduction similar to the reduction SCR could achieve, and was logistically and economically less onerous for Cominco. In July 1999, EPA objected that ADEC had identified SCR as the best control technology, but failed to require it as BACT. ADEC responded with a second draft PSD permit and technical analysis report in September 1999, again finding Low NOx to be BACT for MG-17. ADEC's second draft abandoned that agency's May 1999 emissions-offsetting justification. ADEC further conceded that, lacking data from Cominco, it could make no judgment as to SCR's impact on the mine's operation, profitability, and competitiveness. It nonetheless concluded, contradicting its earlier finding that SCR was technically and economically feasible, that SCR imposed \"a disproportionate cost\" on the mine. In support of this conclusion, ADEC analogized the mine to a rural utility that would have to increase prices were it required to use SCR. Protesting that Cominco had not adequately demonstrated site-specific factors supporting the assertion of SCR's economical infeasibility, EPA suggested that ADEC include an analysis of SCR's adverse economic impacts on Cominco. Expressing confidentiality concerns, Cominco declined to submit financial data. In December 1999, ADEC issued a final permit and technical analysis report approving Low NOx as BACT for MG-17. Again conceding that it made no judgment as to SCR's impact on the mine's operation, profitability, and competitiveness, ADEC advanced, as cause for its decision, SCR's adverse effect on the mine's unique and continuing impact on the region's economic diversity and the venture's \"world competitiveness.\" ADEC reiterated its rural Alaska utility analogy, and compared SCR's cost to the costs of other, less stringent, control technologies.\n",
      "EPA then issued three orders to ADEC under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 of the Act. Those orders prohibited ADEC from issuing a PSD permit to Cominco without satisfactorily documenting why SCR was not BACT for MG-17. In addition, EPA prohibited Cominco from beginning construction or modification activities at the mine, with limited exceptions. Ruling on ADEC's and Cominco's challenges to these orders, the Ninth Circuit held that EPA had authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 to determine the reasonableness or adequacy of the State's justification for its BACT decision. The Court of Appeals emphasized that provision of a reasoned justification for a BACT determination by a permitting authority is undeniably a CAA \"requirement.\" EPA had properly exercised its discretion in issuing the three orders, the Ninth Circuit held, because (1) Cominco failed to demonstrate SCR's economical infeasibility, and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.\n",
      "Held: CAA authorizes EPA to stop construction of a major pollutant emitting facility permitted by a state authority when EPA finds that an authority's BACT determination is unreasonable in light of 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3)'s prescribed guides. Pp. 483-502.\n",
      "(a) In holding that the EPA orders constituted reviewable \"final action\" under § 7607(b)(1), the Ninth Circuit correctly applied Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154: To be \"final,\" agency action must \"mark the consummation of the agency's decisionmaking process,\" and must either determine \"rights or obligations\" or occasion \"legal consequences,\" id., at 177-178. As the Ninth Circuit noted, EPA had asserted its final position on the factual circumstances underpinning the orders. If the orders survived judicial review, Cominco could not escape the practical and legal consequences of any ADEC-permitted construction Cominco endeavored. P. 483.\n",
      "(b) EPA may issue a stop-construction order, under CAA §§ 113(a)(5) and 167, if a state permitting authority's BACT selection is not reasonable. Pp. 484-496.\n",
      "(1) EPA has rationally construed CAA's BACT definition, 42 U. S. C. § 7479(3), and the statute's listing of BACT as a \"[p]reconstruction requiremen[t]\" for the PSD program, §§ 7475(a)(1) and (4), to mandate a determination of BACT faithful to the statute's definition. EPA urges that state permitting authorities' statutory discretion is constrained by § 7479(3)'s strong, normative terms \"maximum\" and \"achievable.\" EPA accordingly reads §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 to empower the federal Agency to check a state agency's unreasonably lax BACT designation. In support of this reading, EPA notes that Congress intended the PSD program to prevent significant deterioration of air quality in clean-air areas. Without a federal Agency surveillance role that extends to BACT determinations, EPA maintains, this goal is unlikely to be realized. The Act's legislative history suggests that, absent national guidelines, a State deciding to set and enforce strict clean-air standards may lose existing industrial plants to more permissive States. The legislative history further suggests that without a federal check, new plants will play one State off against another with threats to locate in whichever State adopts the most permissive pollution controls. The Court agrees with EPA's reading of the statutory provisions. EPA's CAA construction is reflected in interpretive guides EPA has several times published. Although an interpretation presented in internal guidance memoranda does not qualify for dispositive force under Chevron U.S. A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 865-866, a cogent administrative interpretation nevertheless warrants respect, Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U.S. 371, 385. Pp. 484-488.\n",
      "(2) ADEC's several arguments do not persuade the Court to reject as impermissible EPA's longstanding, consistently maintained interpretation. ADEC argues that CAA's BACT definition, § 7479(3), unambiguously assigns to \"the permitting authority\" alone the decision of the control technology qualifying as \"best available.\" In ADEC's view, EPA's enforcement role is restricted to assuring that the permit contain a BACT limitation. CAA entrusts state authorities with initial responsibility to make BACT determinations because they are best positioned to adjust for local circumstances that might make a technology \"unavailable\" in a particular area. According state authorities initial responsibility, however, does not signify that there can be no unreasonable state agency BACT determinations. Congress vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA \"requirements\" relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT. Having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, Congress would not have implicitly precluded EPA from verifying a state authority's substantive compliance with the BACT requirement. Nor would Congress have limited EPA to determining whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words \"BACT.\" The fact that § 7475(a)(8) expressly requires EPA approval of a State's BACT determination in a limited category of cases does not mean EPA lacks supervisory authority in all other cases. Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations. Those provisions simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily. Also unavailing is ADEC's argument that any reasoned justification requirement for a BACT determination may be enforced only through state administrative and judicial processes in order to allow development of an adequate factual record, to ensure EPA carries the burdens of proof, and to promote certainty. The Court declines to read into CAA's silence the unusual requirement that a federal agency's decisions enforcing federal law must be remitted solely to state court. EPA has rationally interpreted the BACT provisions and its own §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facility's construction. Nor is the Court persuaded by ADEC's practical concerns. There is no reason to conclude that an appropriate record cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decision's reasonableness. In this very case, the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record. After EPA did so, all the parties agreed to the record's adequacy. As to the burdens of production and persuasion, the Court holds that EPA bears both burdens in a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order as well as in an EPA-initiated civil action. The underlying question a reviewing court must answer is the same in either case: Was the BACT determination unreasonable given the statutory guides and the state administrative record. Nor does the Court find compelling the suggestion that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA will be free to invalidate a BACT determination months or years after a permit issues. This case involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, not postconstruction federal directives. EPA itself regards it as imperative to act on a timely basis. Courts are also less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the further planning and construction have progressed. Pp. 488-496.\n",
      "(c) In this case, EPA properly exercised its statutory authority under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 in finding that ADEC's acceptance of Low NOx as BACT for MG-17 lacked evidentiary support. EPA's orders, therefore, were neither arbitrary nor capricious. Pp. 496-502.\n",
      "(1) The Court considers whether EPA's finding was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law\" under the applicable review standard set forth in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). While EPA's three skeletal orders were not composed with ideal clarity, they properly ground EPA's BACT determination when read together with EPA's accompanying explanatory correspondence. See Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286. As the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADEC's BACT designation did not qualify as reasonable in light of statutory guides. In the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both technically and economically feasible. That technology should have been designated BACT absent considerations justifying a conclusion that SCR was not achievable in this case. ADEC, however, selected Low NOx as BACT based on Cominco's emissions-offsetting suggestion. In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on that suggestion. Rather, ADEC candidly stated that it aimed to support Cominco's project and its contributions to the region. ADEC's selection of Low NOx thus rested squarely and solely on SCR's \"disproportionate cost.\" EPA rightly concluded that ADEC's switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record. ADEC forthrightly conceded it was disarmed from reaching a judgment on SCR's economic impact on the mine by Cominco's refusal to provide relevant financial data. No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR, would be obliged to cut personnel or raise zinc prices. Having acknowledged that it lacked information needed to judge SCR's impact on the mine's operation, profitability, or competitiveness, ADEC could not simultaneously proffer threats to the mine's operation and competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible. Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice. To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked cost figures discussed in four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production. ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCR's per-ton cost to be well within what ADEC and EPA consider economically feasible. No reasoned explanation for ADEC's retreat from this position appears in the permit ADEC issued. ADEC's basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness to support Cominco's project and its contributions to the region. This justification, however, hardly meets ADEC's own standard of a source-specific economic impact that demonstrates SCR to be inappropriate as BACT. ADEC's justification that lower aggregate emissions would result from Cominco's agreement to install Low NOx on all its generators is also unpersuasive. The final PSD permit did not offset MG-17's emissions against those of the mine's six existing generators. As ADEC recognized in September and December 1999, a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one \"bubble\" for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is part of the permit action. In December 1999, however, only MG-17 figured in the permit action. Pp. 496-501.\n",
      "(2) This decision does not impede ADEC from revisiting its BACT determination. In letters and orders throughout the permitting process and at oral argument, EPA repeatedly acknowledged that ADEC may yet prepare an appropriate record supporting its selection of Low NOx as BACT. There is no reason not to take EPA at its word. Pp. 501-502.\n",

But the fact that the relevant statutory guides — \"maximum\" pollution reduction, considerations of energy, environmental, and economic impacts — may not yield a \"single, objectively `correct' BACT determination,\" id., at 23, surely does not signify that there can be no unreasonable determinations. Nor does Congress' sensitivity to site-specific factors necessarily imply a design to preclude in this context meaningful EPA oversight under §§ 113(a)(5) and 167. EPA claims no prerogative to designate the correct BACT; the Agency asserts only the authority to guard against unreasonable designations.

Reg., at 13797. Congress, however, vested EPA with explicit and sweeping authority to enforce CAA \"requirements\" relating to the construction and modification of sources under the PSD program, including BACT. We fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agency from verifying substantive compliance with the BACT provisions and, instead, limit EPA's superintendence to the insubstantial question whether the state permitting authority had uttered the key words \"BACT.\"\n",

Reg., at 13797. Only when a state agency's BACT determination is \"not based on a reasoned analysis,\" App. 274, may EPA step in to ensure that the statutory requirements are honored.14 EPA adhered to that limited role here, explaining why ADEC's BACT determination was \"arbitrary\" and contrary to ADEC's own findings. Id., at 149-150. EPA's limited but vital role in enforcing BACT is consistent with a scheme that \"places primary responsibilities and authority with the States, backed by the Federal Government.\" S. Rep.

See Brief for Petitioner 25; Reply Brief for Petitioner 6. Had Congress intended EPA superintendence of BACT determinations, ADEC urges, Congress would have said so expressly by mandating Agency approval of all, not merely some, BACT determinations. Brief for Petitioner 25-26. ADEC's argument overlooks the obvious difference between a statutory requirement, e. g., § 7475(a)(8), and a statutory authorization. Sections 113(a)(5) and 167 sensibly do not require EPA approval of all state BACT determinations, they simply authorize EPA to act in the unusual case in which a state permitting authority has determined BACT arbitrarily. EPA recognizes that its authorization to issue a stop order may be exercised only when a state permitting authority's decision is unreasonable; in contrast, a required approval may be withheld if EPA would come to a different determination on the merits. See, e. g., 57 Fed. Reg. 28095 (1992) (\"EPA acknowledges that states have the primary role in administering and enforcing the various components of the PSD program. States have been largely successful in this effort, and EPA's involvement in interpretative and enforcement issues is limited to only a small number of cases.\").\n",

Id., at 36-37. Unless EPA review of BACT determinations is channeled into state administrative and judicial forums, ADEC suggests, \"there is nothing to prevent the EPA from invalidating a BACT determination at any time — months, even years, after a permit has been issued.\" Id., at 35.\n",

      "It would be unusual, to say the least, for Congress to remit a federal agency enforcing federal law solely to state court. We decline to read such an uncommon regime into the Act's silence. EPA, the expert federal agency charged with enforcing the Act, has interpreted the BACT provisions and its own §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 enforcement powers not to require recourse to state processes before stopping a facility's construction. See supra, at 485-488. That rational interpretation, we agree, is surely permissible.16\n",

      "\n",
      "55\n",
      "Nor are we persuaded by ADEC's practical concerns. We see no reason to conclude that an appropriate record generally cannot be developed to allow informed federal-court review when EPA disputes a BACT decision's reasonableness. ADEC contends that, in this very case, \"the State's BACT determination was reviewed by the Ninth Circuit on an incomplete record.\" Brief for Petitioner 37. ADEC, however, offers no particulars to back up its assertion that the Court of Appeals proceeded on an inadequate evidentiary record. We note again that the Ninth Circuit ordered EPA to submit a complete administrative record. 298 F. 3d, at 818. After the Agency declared that the record was complete, \"all the parties effectively agreed that the record as it stood was adequate to resolve the issues on appeal.\" Ibid.\n",

      "As to the burdens of production and persuasion, nothing in the Act suggests that EPA gains a proof-related tactical advantage by issuing a stop-construction order instead of seeking relief through a civil action. But cf. post, at 510 (EPA authority to issue stop-construction orders creates \"the anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State\"). Correspondingly, nothing in our decision today invites or permits EPA to achieve an unfair advantage through its choice of litigation forum. In granting EPA a choice between initiating a civil action and exercising its stop-construction-order authority, see supra, at 473-474, 492, n. 15, Congress nowhere suggested that the allocation of proof burdens would differ depending upon which enforcement route EPA selected. The point ought not to be left in doubt. Accordingly, we hold that in either an EPA-initiated civil action or a challenge to an EPA stop-construction order filed in state or federal court, the production and persuasion burdens remain with EPA and the underlying question a reviewing court resolves remains the same: Whether the state agency's BACT determination was reasonable, in light of the statutory guides and the state administrative record. See supra, at 485-486, 491.17\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "57\n",
      "The Ninth Circuit's review of EPA's order is in keeping with our holding that EPA may not reduce the burden it must carry by electing to invoke its stop-construction-order authority. Specifically, the Court of Appeals rested its judgment on what EPA showed from ADEC's own report: \"(1) Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating [to ADEC] that SCR was economically infeasible; and (2) ADEC failed to provide a reasoned justification for its elimination of SCR as a control option.\" 298 F. 3d, at 823. EPA's conclusions, and the basis for them, support the Court of Appeals' determination that the federal Agency's grounds for issuing the orders under review were not \"arbitrar[y] and capriciou[s].\" Ibid. Our own analysis, infra at 497-502, similarly hinges on the question whether ADEC's BACT determination was a reasonable one. Our analysis would have taken the same path had EPA initiated a civil action pursuant to § 113(a)(5)(C), or if the suit under consideration had been filed initially in state court.\n",

      "Nor do we find compelling ADEC's suggestion, reiterated by the dissent, that, if state courts are not the exclusive judicial arbiters, EPA would be free to invalidate a BACT determination \"months, even years, after a permit has been issued.\" Brief for Petitioner 35; post, at 512-514. This case threatens no such development. It involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA, see supra, at 481, not postconstruction federal Agency directives. EPA itself regards it as \"imperative\" to act on a timely basis, recognizing that courts are \"less likely to require new sources to accept more stringent permit conditions the farther planning and construction have progressed.\" App. 273 (July 15, 1988, EPA guidance memorandum). In the one instance of untimely EPA action ADEC identifies, the federal courts declined to permit enforcement to proceed. See United States v. AM General Corp., 34 F. 3d 472, 475 (CA7 1994) (affirming District Court's dismissal of an EPA-initiated enforcement action where EPA did not act until well after the facility received a PSD permit and completed plant modifications). EPA, we are confident, could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and the dissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to review EPA's actions. Cf. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.S. 664, 678-679 (1970); Panhandle Oil Co. v. Mississippi ex rel. Knox, 277 U.S. 218, 223 (1928) (Holmes, J., dissenting), overruled in part by Alabama v.

      "* We turn finally, and more particularly, to the reasons why we conclude that EPA properly exercised its statutory authority in this case. ADEC urges that, even if the Act allows the Agency to issue stop-construction orders when a state permitting authority unreasonably determines BACT, EPA acted impermissibly in this instance. See Brief for Petitioner 39-48. We note, first, EPA's threshold objection. ADEC's petition to this Court questioned whether the Act accorded EPA oversight authority with respect to a State's BACT determination. Pet. for Cert. 13-22. ADEC did not present, as a discrete issue, the question whether EPA, assuming it had authority to review the substance of a state BACT determination, nevertheless abused its authority by countermanding ADEC's permit for the Red Dog Mine expansion. See Brief for Respondents 44-45; cf. Reply Brief for Petitioner 15-16, n. 12 (\"EPA asserts authority to overturn only `arbitrary or unreasoned' state BACT determinations. . . . Thus, whether the State issued a reasoned justification is `fairly included' within the question presented[.]\"). Treating the case-specific issue as embraced within the sole question presented, we are satisfied that EPA did not act arbitrarily in finding that ADEC furnished no tenable accounting for its determination that Low NOx was BACT for MG-17.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "61\n",
      "Because the Act itself does not specify a standard for judicial review in this instance,18 we apply the familiar default standard of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), and ask whether the Agency's action was \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" Even when an agency explains its decision with \"less than ideal clarity,\" a reviewing court will not upset the decision on that account \"if the agency's path may reasonably be discerned.\" Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974). EPA's three skeletal orders to ADEC and Cominco surely are not composed with ideal clarity. These orders, however, are properly read together with accompanying explanatory correspondence from EPA; so read, the Agency's comments and orders adequately ground the determination that ADEC's acceptance of Low NOx for MG-17 was unreasonable given the facts ADEC found.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "62\n",
      "In the two draft permits and the final permit, ADEC formally followed the EPA-recommended top-down methodology to determine BACT, as Cominco had done in its application. App. 61, 109, 175; see supra, at 475-476. Employing that methodology in the May 1999 draft permit, ADEC first concluded that SCR was the most stringent emission-control technology that was both \"technically and economically feasible.\" App. 65; see supra, at 476. That technology should have been designated BACT absent \"technical considerations, or energy, environmental, or economic impacts justif[ying] a conclusion that [SCR was] not `achievable' in [this] case.\" New Source Review Manual, p. B.2; App. 61-62. ADEC nevertheless selected Low NOx as BACT; ADEC did so in May 1999 based on Cominco's suggestion that fitting all Red Dog Mine generators with Low NOx would reduce aggregate emissions. Id., at 87, 111-112; see supra, at 476-477.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "63\n",
      "In September and December 1999, ADEC again rejected SCR as BACT but no longer relied on Cominco's suggestion that it could reduce aggregate emissions by equipping all generators with Low NOx. See supra, at 478-480. ADEC candidly stated that it aimed \"[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region.\" App. 208. In these second and third rounds, ADEC rested its selection of Low NOx squarely and solely on SCR's \"disproportionate cost.\" Id., at 116; id., at 112-117, 203-208; supra, at 478-480.\n",
      "\n",

      "EPA concluded that ADEC's switch from finding SCR economically feasible in May 1999 to finding SCR economically infeasible in September 1999 had no factual basis in the record. See App. 138. In the September and December 1999 technical analyses, ADEC acknowledged that \"no judgment [could then] be made as to the impact of [SCR's] cost on the operation, profitability, and competitiveness of the Red Dog Mine.\" Id., at 116, 207. ADEC nevertheless concluded that SCR would threaten both the Red Dog Mine's \"unique and continuing impact on the economic diversity\" of northwest Alaska and the mine's \"world competitiveness.\" Id., at 208. ADEC also stressed the mine's role as employer in an area with \"historical high unemployment and limited permanent year-round job opportunities.\" Id., at 207.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "65\n",
      "We do not see how ADEC, having acknowledged that no determination \"[could] be made as to the impact of [SCR's] cost on the operation . . . and competitiveness of the [mine],\" ibid., could simultaneously proffer threats to the mine's operation or competitiveness as reasons for declaring SCR economically infeasible. ADEC, indeed, forthrightly explained why it was disarmed from reaching any judgment on whether, or to what extent, implementation of SCR would adversely affect the mine's operation or profitability: Cominco had declined to provide the relevant financial data, disputing the need for such information and citing \"confidentiality\" concerns, id., at 134; see supra, at 479-480; 298 F. 3d, at 823 (\"Cominco failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that SCR was economically infeasible.\"). No record evidence suggests that the mine, were it to use SCR for its new generator, would be obliged to cut personnel, or raise zinc prices. Absent evidence of that order, ADEC lacked cause for selecting Low NOx as BACT based on the more stringent control's impact on the mine's operation or competitiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "66\n",
      "Nor has ADEC otherwise justified its choice of Low NOx. To bolster its assertion that SCR was too expensive, ADEC invoked four BACT determinations made in regard to diesel generators used for primary power production; BACT's cost, in those instances, ranged from $0 to $936 per ton of nitrogen oxide removed. App. 205-206; supra, at 480. ADEC itself, however, had previously found SCR's per-ton cost, then estimated as $2,279, to be \"well within what ADEC and EPA considers economically feasible.\" App. 84; cf. id., at 204 (estimating SCR's per ton cost to be $2,100). No reasoned explanation for ADEC's retreat from this position appears in the final permit. See id., at 138 (\"[SCR's cost falls] well within the range of costs EPA has seen permitting authorities nationwide accept as economically feasible for NOx control except where there are compelling site specific factors that indicate otherwise.\"). Tellingly, as to examples of low-cost BACT urged by Cominco, ADEC acknowledged: \"The cited examples of engines permitted in Alaska without requiring SCR are not valid examples as they either took place over 18 months ago or were not used for similar purposes.\" Id., at 233-234 (footnote omitted). ADEC added that it has indeed \"permitted [Alaska] projects requiring SCR.\" Id., at 234. Further, EPA rejected ADEC's comparison between the mine and a rural utility, see supra, at 479, because \"no facts exist to suggest that the `economic impact' of the incrementally higher cost of SCR on the world's largest producer of zinc concentrates would be anything like its impact on a rural, non-profit utility that must pass costs on to a small base of individual consumers,\" Brief for Respondents 49; App. 138-139 (similar observation in Nov. 10, 1999, EPA letter).\n",

      "ADEC's basis for selecting Low NOx thus reduces to a readiness \"[t]o support Cominco's Red Dog Mine Production Rate Increase Project, and its contributions to the region.\" Id., at 208. This justification, however, hardly meets ADEC's own standard of a \"source-specific . . . economic impac[t] which demonstrate[s] [SCR] to be inappropriate as BACT.\" Id., at 177. In short, as the Ninth Circuit determined, EPA validly issued stop orders because ADEC's BACT designation simply did not qualify as reasonable in light of the statutory guides.\n",

      "In its briefs to this Court, ADEC nonetheless justifies its selection of Low NOx as BACT for MG-17 on the ground that lower aggregate emissions would result from Cominco's \"agree[ment] to install Low NOx on all its generators.\" Brief for Petitioner 42, and n. 12 (emphasis added); id., at 29; Reply Brief for Petitioner 19, n. 16. We need not dwell on ADEC's attempt to resurrect Cominco's emissions-offsetting suggestion, see supra, at 477, adopted in the initial May 1999 draft permit, but thereafter dropped. As ADEC acknowledges, the final PSD permit did not offset MG-17's emissions against those of the mine's six existing generators, installations that were not subject to BACT. Brief for Petitioner 42, n. 12; App. 149. ADEC recognized in September and December 1999 that a State may treat emissions from several pollutant sources as falling under one \"bubble\"19 for PSD permit purposes only if every pollutant source so aggregated is \"part of the permit action.\" Id., at 111, 199. Offsetting new emissions against those from any of the mine's other generators, ADEC agreed, \"[was] not a consideration of the BACT review provided for by the applicable law or guidelines,\" for those generators remained outside the permit's compass. Id., at 112, 199. ADEC plainly did not, and could not, base its December 10, 1999, permit and technical analysis on an emissions-offsetting rationale drawing in generators not subject to BACT.

The State of Alaska had in place procedures that were in full compliance with the governing statute and accompanying regulations promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As I understand the opinion of the Court and the parties' submissions, there is no disagreement on this point. Alaska followed these procedures to determine the best available control technology (BACT). EPA, however, sought to overturn the State's decision, not by the process of judicial review, but by administrative flat.

The meaning of the word \"requiremen[t],\" though, is not defined in these provisions. Other provisions of the Act must be consulted. All parties agree that the requirement in this case is the \"preconstruction requiremen[t]\" that a \"major emitting facility\" be \"subject to the best available control technology [BACT] for each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter emitted from, or which results from, such facility.\" § 7475(a)(4).

The statute, however, contemplates no such arrangement. It directs the \"permitting authority\" — here, the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC) — to \"determine\" what constitutes BACT. To \"determine\" is not simply to make an initial recommendation that can later be overturned. It is \"[t]o decide or settle . . . conclusively and authoritatively.\" American Heritage Dictionary 495 (4th ed. 2000).

Ante, at 485 (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, for a State to do so without regard to the other mandatory criteria would be to ignore the words of the statute. The Act requires a more comprehensive judgment. It provides that the permitting authority must \"tak[e] into account\" a set of contextual considerations — \"energy, environmental, and economic impacts and other costs\" — to identify the best control technology \"on a case-by-case basis.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7479(3). The majority reaches its narrow view of the scope of the State's discretion only by wresting two adjectives, \"maximum\" and \"achievable,\" out of context.

      "To be sure, §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 authorize EPA to enforce requirements of the Act. These provisions, however, do not limit the States' latitude and responsibility to balance all the statutory factors in making their discretionary judgments. If a State has complied with the Act's requirements, §§ 113(a)(5) and 167 are not implicated and can supply no separate basis for EPA to exercise a supervisory role over a State's discretionary decision. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had it altogether backwards when it reasoned that, \"because neither Section 113(a)(5) nor Section 167 contains any exemption for requirements that involve the state's exercise of discretion,\" EPA had the authority to issue orders countermanding the State's BACT determination. 298 F. 3d 814, 820 (2002). The question is not whether the two sections contain any exemption. Rather, it is about the nature of the Act's requirements and whether EPA has the authority to set aside a BACT determination when no requirement of the Act was violated in the first place. In affirming the judgment of the Court of Appeals, the majority repeats the same analytical error. See ante, at 490 (\"We fail to see why Congress, having expressly endorsed an expansive surveillance role for EPA in two independent CAA provisions, would then implicitly preclude the Agency from verifying substantive compliance with [BACT] . . .\"). When the statute is read as a whole, it is clear that the CAA commits BACT determinations to the discretion of the relevant permitting authorities.

As even EPA acknowledged, ADEC \"provid[ed] a detailed accounting of the process.\" App. 286. This is not a case, then, where the state agency failed to have a BACT review procedure in place or altogether refused to apply the statute's formal requirements. EPA's only quarrel is with ADEC's substantive conclusion. In disagreeing with ADEC, EPA's sole contention, in the section of its order titled \"Findings of Fact,\" is that \"[selective catalytic reduction] is BACT.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 30a, 34a (emphasis added). In addition, EPA does not allege that using Low NOx would violate other CAA requirements, such as the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, Alaska's Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) increments, or other applicable emission standards, see 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(3).

Outside the context of the CAA, Congress likewise knows how to establish federal oversight in unambiguous language. See, e. g., 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A) (1994 ed.)

No. 95-294, p. 146 (1977), Congress made the overriding judgment that States are more responsive to local conditions and can strike the right balance between preserving environmental quality and advancing competing objectives. By assigning certain functions to the States, Congress assumed they would have a stake in implementing the environmental objectives of the Act.

Counsel for respondents were unable to identify, either in their briefs or at oral argument, a single State that \"does not have in its law the requirement that its own agencies . . . act rationally.\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 30. Although it remains an open question whether EPA can bypass the state judiciary and go directly into federal district court under 28 U.S.C. § 1345, the availability of state judicial review defeats the Government's argument that, absent EPA's oversight, there is a legal vacuum where BACT decisions are not subject to review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "89\n",
      "Requiring EPA to seek administrative and judicial review of a State's BACT determination, instead of allowing it to be overturned by fiat, avoids the anomaly of shifting the burden of pleading and of initiating litigation from EPA to the State. Whether the BACT decision is reviewed in state court, or in federal district court if that option is available, see supra, at 509 and this page, EPA, as petitioner, bears the initial burden and costs of filing a petition for review alleging that the State acted arbitrarily. Under the scheme endorsed by the majority today, the tables are turned. Once EPA has issued an enforcement order, and the State seeks to invalidate that order, the State bears the burden of alleging that EPA acted arbitrarily. EPA and the majority concede that, because States enjoy substantial discretion in making BACT determinations, courts reviewing EPA's order must ask not simply whether EPA acted arbitrarily but the convoluted question whether EPA acted arbitrarily in finding the State acted arbitrarily. Even under this unwieldy standard of review, and even if the burdens of persuasion and production remain with EPA, see ante, at 493-494, the initial burden of pleading and litigation now belongs to the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "90\n",
      "To make its decision more palatable, the majority holds that EPA still bears the burdens of production and persuasion, but there is little authority for this. The Court purports to rely on McCormick on Evidence for the proposition that \"`looking for the burden of pleading is not a foolproof guide to the allocation of the burdens of proof.'\" Ante, at 494, n. 17 (quoting 2 J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence § 337, pp. 411-412 (5th ed. 1999)). The example — affirmative defense — discussed in that passage of the treatise, however, is far afield from the issues raised in this case. In fact, the treatise instructs that \"[i]n most cases, the party who has the burden of pleading a fact will have the burdens of producing evidence and of persuading the jury of its existence as well.\" Id., at 411. This is because \"[t]he burdens of pleading and proof with regard to most facts have been and should be assigned to the plaintiff who generally seeks to change the present state of affairs and who therefore naturally should be expected to bear the risk of failure of proof or persuasion.\" Id., at 412. In this case, EPA changed the status quo ante by issuing an order invalidating ADEC's decision. Without upsetting accepted evidentiary principles, the majority cannot explain why EPA, as respondent in federal court — as opposed to the State, as petitioner alleging that EPA's fait accompli was arbitrary — should bear the burdens of persuasion and production, or how this unusual reallocation of burdens should work in practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "91\n",
      "In any event, even the majority accepts that, under its reading of the statute, the State now bears the burden of pleading. With this burden-shifting benefit alone, EPA is most unlikely to follow the procedure, prescribed by federal law, of participating in the State's administrative process and seeking judicial review in state courts. Instead, EPA can simply issue a unilateral order invalidating the State's BACT determination and put the burden on the State to challenge EPA's order. This end run around the State's process is sure to undermine it. Unless Congress was on a fool's errand, the loophole the majority finds goes only to demonstrate the inconsistency between its approach and the statutory scheme.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "92\n",
      "There is a further, and serious, flaw in the Court's ruling. Suppose, before EPA issued its orders setting aside the State's BACT determination, an Alaska state court had reviewed the matter and found no error of law or abuse of discretion in ADEC's determination. The majority's interpretation of the statute would allow EPA to intervene at this point for the first time, announce that ADEC's determination is unreasoned under the CAA, and issue its own orders nullifying the state court's ruling. This reworking of the balance between State and Federal Governments, not to mention the reallocation of authority between the Executive and Judicial Branches, shows the implausibility of the majority's reasoning.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "93\n",
      "If a federal agency were to exercise an analogous power to review the decisions of federal courts, the arrangement would violate the well-established rule that the judgments of Article III courts cannot be revised by the Executive or Legislative Branches. See Hayburn's Case, 2 Dall. 409, 410, n. (1792) (\"`[B]y the Constitution, neither the Secretary [of] War, nor any other Executive officer, nor even the Legislature, are authorized to sit as a court of errors on . . . judicial acts or opinions . . .'\"); see also Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211 (1995). The principle that judicial decisions cannot be reopened at the whim of the Executive or the Legislature is essential to preserving separation of powers and judicial independence. Judges cannot, without sacrificing the autonomy of their office, put onto the scales of justice some predictive judgment about the probability that an administrator might reverse their rulings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "94\n",
      "The Court today denies state judicial systems the same judicial independence it has long guarded for itself — only that the injury here is worse. Under the majority's holding, decisions by state courts would be subject to being overturned, not just by any agency, but by an agency established by a different sovereign. We should be reluctant to interpret a congressional statute to deny to States the judicial independence guaranteed by their own constitutions. See Buckalew v. Holloway, 604 P. 2d 240, 245 (Alaska 1979) (\"There is no doubt that judicial independence was a paramount concern of the delegates [to the Alaska Constitutional Convention]\"); see also, e.g., Cal. Const., Art. 3, § 3 (\"The powers of state government are legislative, executive, and judicial. Persons charged with the exercise of one power may not exercise either of the others except as permitted by this Constitution\"); see also 7 B. Witkin, Summary of California Law § 107, pp. 159-160 (9th ed. 1988) (\"[Under] the principle of separation of powers . . ., one [department] cannot exercise or interfere with the functions of either of the others\"). The Federal Government is free, within its vast legislative authority, to impose federal standards. For States to have a role, however, their own governing processes must be respected. New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144 (1992). If, by some course of reasoning, state courts must live with the insult that their judgments can be revised by a federal agency, the Court should at least insist upon a clear instruction from Congress. That directive cannot be found here. Cf. Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991) (\"[I]f Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n",

      "There is a final deficiency in the scheme the majority finds in the statute. Nothing in the Court's analysis prevents EPA from issuing an order setting aside a BACT determination months, or even years, later. Congress cannot have intended this result. After all, when Congress provides for EPA's involvement, it directs the agency to act sooner rather than later by establishing a preauthorization procedure. 42 U.S.C. § 7475(a)(8). The majority misses the point when it faults ADEC for \"overlook[ing] the obvious difference between a statutory requirement . . . and a statutory authorization.\" Ante, at 491 (emphasis deleted). ADEC does not overlook the difference between approval before the fact and oversight after the fact. Rather, ADEC, unlike the majority, recognizes that the Act's explicit provision for a preauthorization process underscores the need for finality in state permitting decisions, making implausible an interpretation of the statute that would allow a post hoc veto procedure that upsets the same reliance and expectation interests.\n",

      "The majority's initial response that \"[t]his case threatens no such development [because] [i]t involves preconstruction orders issued by EPA . . ., not postconstruction federal Agency directives,\" ante, at 495, provides no assurance that the logic of its reasoning would not in the future allow EPA's belated interventions. When the majority confronts the problem, it concludes that \"EPA, we are confident, could not indulge in the inequitable conduct ADEC and the dissent hypothesize while the federal courts sit to review EPA's actions.\" Ibid. The authority it cites for this proposition, however, consists of nothing more than a religious exemption case that is far removed from the issues presented here and a dissent from a case that has been overruled in part. Ibid. State agencies rely on this dictum at their own risk.\n",

      "The majority's reassurance to the States will likely be to no avail. \"The principle that the United States are not bound by any statute of limitations, nor barred by any laches of their officers, however gross, in a suit brought by them as a sovereign Government to enforce a public right, or to assert a public interest, is established past all controversy or doubt.\" United States v. Beebe, 127 U.S. 338, 344 (1888); see also United States v. Summerlin, 310 U.S. 414, 416 (1940) (\"It is well settled that the United States is not bound by state statutes of limitation or subject to the defense of laches in enforcing its rights\"); Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389, 409 (1917) (\"[L]aches or neglect of duty on the part of officers of the Government is no defense to a suit by it to enforce a public right or protect a public interest. . . . A suit by the United States to enforce and maintain its policy . . . stands upon a different plane in this and some other respects from the ordinary private suit. . .\"). Section 167, moreover, is mandatory. Once a violation of a statutory \"requirement\" is found, \"[t]he Administrator shall . . . take such measures, including issuance of an order, or seeking injunctive relief, as necessary to prevent the construction or modification of a major emitting facility which does not conform to the requirements of this part. . . .\" 42 U.S.C. § 7477. In short, EPA's enforcement authority can — indeed, must — be exercised at any point. In light of our precedents a court would be hard pressed to hold otherwise.\n",

In the proper discharge of their responsibilities to implement the CAA in different conditions and localities nationwide, the States maintain permanent staffs within special agencies. These state employees, who no doubt take pride in their own resourcefulness, expertise, and commitment to the law, are the officials directed by Congress to make case-by-case, site-specific, determinations under the Act. Regulated persons and entities should be able to consult an agency staff with certainty and confidence, giving due consideration to agency recommendations and guidance. After today's decision, however, a state agency can no longer represent itself as the real governing body. No matter how much time was spent in consultation and negotiation, a single federal administrator can in the end set all aside by a unilateral order. This is a great step backward in Congress' design to grant States a significant stake in developing and enforcing national environmental objectives.\n",

In practical terms, however, the majority displaces state agencies, and degrades their role, in much the same way. In the case before us the applicant made elaborate submissions to ADEC. For over a year and a half, there ensued the constructive discourse that is the very object of the agency process, with both the ADEC staff and the applicant believing the State's decision would be dispositive. EPA did not participate in the administrative process, but waited until after the record was closed to intervene by issuing an order setting aside the BACT determination.\n",

To its credit, the majority holds Chevron deference inapplicable.

So deficient are its statutory arguments that the majority must hide behind Chevron's vocabulary, despite its explicit holding that Chevron does not apply.

Under the majority's reasoning, these other statutes, too, could be said to confer on federal agencies ultimate decisionmaking authority, relegating States to the role of mere provinces or political corporations, instead of coequal sovereigns entitled to the same dignity and respect. Cf. Alden v. Maine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999). If cooperative federalism, Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.S. 264, 289 (1981), is to achieve Congress' goal of allowing state governments to be accountable to the democratic process in implementing environmental policies, federal agencies cannot consign States to the ministerial tasks of information gathering and making initial recommendations, while reserving to themselves the authority to make final judgments under the guise of surveillance and oversight.\n",

      "In 1997, the EPA revised the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone from a 1-hour standard to an 8-hour standard. These consolidated petitions for review challenge aspects of the Final Rule To Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard  Phase 2, 70 Fed.Reg. 71,612 (2005) (Phase 2 Rule), and Phase 2 of the Final Rule To Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard  Notice of Reconsideration, 72 Fed.Reg. 31,727 (2007) (Reconsideration Notice). We hold the Phase 2 Rule is inconsistent with the Clean Air Act (CAA or Act) in allowing participation in a regional cap-and-trade program to satisfy an area-specific statutory mandate. We further hold the EPA arbitrarily eliminated one safeguard and violated the anti-backsliding provision of the Act insofar as it eliminated another from its regulations governing review of new sources of pollution. We therefore grant the petitions with respect to those aspects of the Phase 2 Rule. In view of our decision in North Carolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896 (2008), in which we granted a petition for review of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), we defer consideration of the Phase 2 Rule and Reconsideration Notice insofar as they relate to the CAIR program. We deny the petitions in all other respects.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. Background\n",
      "The Act requires the EPA to designate areas as attainment, nonattainment, or unclassifiable for each NAAQS. CAA § 107(d)(1)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(1)(B). States have primary responsibility for implementing those standards, and must submit a state implementation plan (SIP) that specifies how the state will achieve and maintain compliance with the NAAQS. Id. § 7407(a). Part D of the Act provides the SIP for a nonattainment area must include certain control measures. Id. § 7501 et seq. Subpart 1 applies to all nonattainment areas, id. §§ 7501-7509a, whereas Subpart 2 specifies additional requirements for ozone nonattainment areas, id. § § 7511-7511 f. Section 181 of the Act classifies ozone nonattainment areas from \"marginal\" to \"extreme\" based upon the degree to which the ozone level in the area exceeds the NAAQS. Id. § 7511. An area that exceeds the NAAQS by a greater margin is given more time to meet the standard but is subjected to progressively more stringent emissions controls for ozone precursors, namely, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). See CAA § 182, 42 U.S.C. § 7511a.\n",
      "In 1997, the EPA determined the NAAQS for ozone, expressed as the amount of ozone in the ambient air averaged over one hour, was inadequate to protect public health. The EPA therefore promulgated a new NAAQS of .08 ppm of ozone averaged over eight hours. Under the 8-hour standard, some ozone nonattainment areas are subject only to the more flexible requirements of Subpart 1, while areas with higher levels of ozone are subject to the additional requirements of Subpart 2. See S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. *1251 Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882, 893-95 (D.C.Cir.2006).\n",
      "The EPA implemented the 8-hour NAAQS in two phases; the Phase 2 Rule and Reconsideration Notice here under review implement the requirements of Subpart 1 and Subpart 2 for areas not attaining the 8-hour NAAQS. The consolidated petitions challenge those rules as follows. The Natural Resources Defense Council, the States of New Jersey, Connecticut, and New York, and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association challenge provisions implementing the statutory requirement that each nonattainment area provide for such emissions reductions as may be obtained by the adoption of reasonably available control technology (RACT). The NRDC and New Jersey challenge provisions governing review of new sources of pollution. The NRDC also challenges two provisions implementing the statutory requirements that a SIP for a nonattainment area provide for specific percentage reductions in emissions and for contingency measures. Finally, the Chamber of Greater Baton Rouge and affiliated petitioners[1] challenge the imposition of reformulated gasoline requirements in the Baton Rouge area.\n",
      "We review the EPA's interpretation of the Act pursuant to Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984): We ask first whether the Congress has \"directly spoken to the precise question at issue.\" Id. at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If so, then we must \"give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\" Id. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If, however, the \"statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,\" then we defer to the EPA's interpretation as long as it is \"based on a permissible construction of the statute.\" Id. The Act requires us to review the Phase 2 Rule deferentially to determine only whether it is \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\" CAA § 307(d)(9)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(9)(A); see Bluewater Network v. EPA, 372 F.3d 404, 410 (D.C.Cir.2004) (\"We give particular deference to the EPA when it acts under unwieldy and science-driven statutory schemes like the Clean Air Act\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",

      "II. Reasonably Available Control Technology\n",
      "Section 172(c)(1) of the Act requires that the SIPs for nonattainment areas \"provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology).\" 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(1) (emphasis added). Ozone nonattainment areas that are subject to Subpart 2 of Part D are subject to more specific reasonably available control technology requirements. E.g., id. § 7511a(b)(2)(C); id. § 7511a(f). Petitioners challenge three aspects of the implementation of the RACT requirement in the Phase 2 Rule. First, the NRDC challenges the rule providing that RACT is satisfied for Subpart 1 areas by SIPs \"demonstrating that the area has adopted all control measures necessary to demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as possible,\" Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,701 (codified at 40 C.F.R. § 51.912(c)(1)). Second, the State of New Jersey challenges the EPA's decision to allow states to meet the RACT *1252 requirement under the 8-hour NAAQS by certifying that RACT is met under the 1-hour NAAQS, see id. at 71,652-53. Third, the NRDC, New Jersey, the States of Connecticut and New York, and the National Petrochemical and Refiners Association challenge the EPA's conclusion that states may satisfy the RACT requirement by participating in two cap-and-trade programs, the NOx SIP Call and CAIR, see id. The court has stayed consideration of the CAIR-RACT determination.[2]\n",

      "The NRDC challenges the Phase 2 Rule's treatment of the \"reasonably available control technology\" requirement of CAA § 172(c)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(1). Under the Phase 2 Rule, nonattainment areas governed by Subpart 1 that request an attainment deadline within five years of their designation \"shall meet the RACT requirement by submitting an attainment demonstration SIP demonstrating that the area has adopted all control measures necessary to demonstrate attainment as expeditiously as practicable.\" Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,701/3 (codified at 40 C.F.R. § 51.912(c)(1)). The NRDC contends that this provision is an unlawful waiver of the RACT requirement of § 172(c)(1) because, under the Phase 2 Rule, a state need not require RACT at all in such areas. It views the statutory phrase \"at a minimum\" as imposing an unambiguous requirement for all nonattainment areas. The NRDC thus contends the Phase 2 Rule violates the plain text of § 172(c)(1) by doing away with this requirement in some nonattainment areas. However, we conclude that the term \"reasonably available control technology\" is ambiguous in context and that the EPA's interpretation is reasonable.\n",
      "The court has previously concluded that the term \"reasonably available\" in the analogous phrase \"reasonably available control measure\" (RACM) in § 172(c)(1) is ambiguous and \"clearly bespeaks [the Congress's] intention that the EPA exercise discretion in determining which control measures must be implemented....\" Sierra Club v. EPA, 294 F.3d 155, 162-63 (D.C.Cir.2002). The court explained that the statute did not specify which control measures would be deemed \"reasonably available\" and did not \"compel[ ] a state to consider whether any measure is `reasonably available' without regard to whether it would expedite attainment in the relevant area.\" Id. at 162. Thus, the EPA had discretion to conclude that a measure was not \"reasonably available\" if it would not expedite attainment. Id. Because the same is true of the phrase \"reasonably available control technology,\" the term \"reasonably available\" within RACT is also ambiguous. Moreover, even if the phrase \"at a minimum\" requires that at least RACT-level reductions be achieved in all nonattainment areas, the phrase does not specify the content of the RACT requirement. Given this ambiguity, the EPA has discretion reasonably to define the controls that will demonstrate compliance.\n",
      "*1253 The EPA's interpretation, construing \"reasonably available\" as meaning only control technologies that advance attainment, is reasonable in light of the statute's accompanying text and structure. Section 172(c)(1) requires all nonattainment areas to achieve RACM \"as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions . . . as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology)....\" 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(1). To the extent an area is already achieving attainment as expeditiously as possible, imposition of additional control technologies would not hasten achievement of the NAAQS. In such a situation, the EPA may reasonably conclude that no control technologies are reasonably available and the area need not implement further technologies to satisfy the RACT requirement. Sierra Club v. EPA, 294 F.3d 155 (D.C.Cir.2002), supports the reasonableness of the EPA's interpretation. In Sierra Club, the court held reasonable the EPA's interpretation of RACM as requiring only those control measures that would contribute to timely and expeditious attainment. 294 F.3d at 162; see also Sierra Club v. EPA, 314 F.3d 735, 743-45 (5th Cir.2002). The court explained, in part, that the \"Act `use[s] the same terminology in conjunction with the RACM requirement' as it does in requiring timely attainment.\" Sierra Club, 294 F.3d at 162. The § 172(c)(1) RACM requirement, like the timely attainment requirement of CAA § 181(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7511(a)(1), requires implementation of RACM \"as expeditiously as practicable.\" Thus, the court concluded, the RACM requirement could reasonably be understood as a means of meeting the attainment deadline. 294 F.3d at 162. Because the RACT requirement is located in a parenthetical modifying RACM and because the RACM requirement is described as \"including\" the RACT requirement, the RACT requirement is likewise linked to the timely attainment terminology. Given this textual linkage, the EPA may reasonably extend to the RACT requirement its interpretation of RACM as requiring only those control measures that would facilitate expeditious attainment of the NAAQS.\n",
      "Contrary to the NRDC's arguments, the RACT requirement does not lose all meaning under the EPA's definition. When control technology is necessary to advance attainment, it is \"reasonably available\" under the definition and would be required under the rule. The fact that the RACT requirement was previously located in a separate section and not in a parenthetical modifying the RACM requirement does not support the NRDC's position. Compare CAA § 172(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(b)(2), (3) (1977), with CAA § 172(c)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(1) (1990). Rather, the fact that the Congress moved the requirement to a parenthetical modifying the RACM requirement supports the EPA's conclusion that the RACT requirement could be interpreted in the same manner as the RACM requirement. Although both the NRDC and the EPA point to legislative history purportedly supporting their positions, neither points to legislative history bearing on the meaning of \"reasonably available.\" See H.R. REP. NO. 101-490, reprinted in 2 LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF THE CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1990, at 223. The term \"reasonably available\" is ambiguous, and the EPA's interpretation is a permissible construction of the statute.\n",

      "B. Certifying 8-Hour RACT Based Upon 1-Hour RACT\n",
      "The Phase 2 Rule provides that a control measure approved as RACT under the 1-hour standard will be approved as RACT under the 8-hour standard absent information indicating it should not be approved. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at *1254 71,652/3. Rather than reassessing what constitutes RACT, a state can certify that controls that previously satisfied the RACT requirement also satisfy the requirement under the 8-hour standard. New Jersey contends this provision is contrary to the Act and arbitrary and capricious. In New Jersey's view the EPA should require a re-analysis for all sources, not just those for which no controls had been considered RACT under the 1-hour standard, see id. at 71,655, because what is \"reasonably available\" changes over time. Without a re-analysis, New Jersey maintains there is no basis for states to certify that the initial RACT analysis meets the RACT requirement under the 8-hour NAAQS and states may apply outdated RACT controls. New Jersey thus claims that the EPA should have either updated its RACT guidance documents or at least provided uniform criteria for states to use in making RACT certifications.\n",
      "The EPA promulgates two types of guidance that assist states in determining what control techniques meet the RACT requirement, control techniques guidelines (CTGs) and alternative control techniques (ACTs). Section 183 of the Act requires the EPA to issue CTGs for certain categories of sources that emit VOCs. See 42 U.S.C. § 7511b. Where CTGs exist, they establish the presumptive level of control meeting RACT. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,654/3. Still, states can opt to require alternative controls rather than following the guidance in the CTGs. Notice of Final Determination and Availability of Final Control Techniques Guidelines, 71 Fed. Reg. 58,745, 58,747 (Oct. 5, 2006). Section 183(c) of the Act requires the EPA to issue ACTs for major sources of VOCs and NOx. 42 U.S.C. § 7511b(c). The ACTs \"describe available control techniques and their cost effectiveness\" but do not establish presumptive RACT. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,654/3. Thus, neither the CTGs nor ACTs set firm RACT requirements.\n",
      "Despite New Jersey's concerns, the EPA's certification provision does not conflict with the Act and is not arbitrary and capricious. Although the EPA did not revise the guidance documents, the EPA's case-by-case approach adequately ensures that RACT determinations will take into account advances in technology. First, the EPA has directed states to consider available information in addition to the CTG and ACT documents when making RACT determinations. Id. at 71,655/1. If a state is presented with information indicating that a previous RACT determination is inappropriate, the state must consider that information and modify its RACT determinations accordingly. Id. Second, when submitting RACT certifications to the EPA as part of their RACT SIP submissions, states must provide supporting information. Id. at 71,655/2. Third, if additional information is presented during notice-and-comment rulemaking, both the state and the EPA are required to consider that information as part of the rulemaking; this includes information presented during notice-and-comment rulemaking for RACT SIP submissions for previously controlled sources. Id. Because the EPA could reasonably conclude that these mechanisms will ensure the case-by-case determinations will take into account advances in technology, the EPA could also reasonably conclude \"that the best way to address the possibility that CTGs or ACTs might not reflect all currently available technologies was by requiring each State to consider any new available information in making its certification, which will then be reviewed by the EPA as part of the SIP submission process,\" EPA Br. at 67; see also Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,655/1. See Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. EPA, 286 F.3d 554, 566-67 (D.C.Cir.2002). Likewise, given the assurances *1255 that RACT determinations will reflect advances in technology, the EPA's approach is consistent with the statutory goal of timely attainment of the NAAQS, see CAA §§ 172, 182, 42 U.S.C. §§ 7502, 7511a.\n",
      "Additionally, even if the EPA had revised the national guidelines and provided uniform criteria as New Jersey preferred, such actions would not have eliminated case-by-case inquiries by the states and the EPA. Both the CTGs and ACTs are guidance documents, see Conn. Fund for the Env't v. EPA, 672 F.2d 998, 1003 (2d Cir.1982); United States v. Ford Motor Co., 736 F.Supp. 1539, 1543 (W.D.Mo. 1990), and neither sets firm RACT requirements. Thus, despite the existence of the CTGs, the EPA makes case-specific determinations as part of its SIP approval process. Notice of Final Determination and Availability of Final Control Techniques Guidelines, 71 Fed.Reg. at 58,747. ACTs are also merely guidelines and do not create presumptive RACT levels. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,654/3. As case-by-case determinations would be necessary even if the EPA had revised the guidance documents, the EPA could reasonably determine that the costs entailed in revising the guidance documents outweighed the benefits. The EPA has discretion to consider the costs of regulation unless the relevant statute precludes such a consideration. See, e.g., Sierra Club, 294 F.3d at 162-63.\n",
      "The EPA's approach also addresses New Jersey's concern that allowing states to make RACT determinations by relying on 15-year-old CTGs plus new information, if any, provided by the public in comments is \"an inadequate substitute\" for requiring each state to undertake a new RACT determination for each source category. As noted, the EPA has directed states to submit supporting documentation along with RACT certifications. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,655/2. Thus, the EPA will have available the information needed to verify states' determinations that the previous controls are still appropriate under the 8-hour standard. Additionally, persons disagreeing with a particular RACT certification can seek judicial review of a particular SIP approval. A state may also complete an entirely new RACT analysis if it so chooses. Id. at 71,652/3.\n",
      "In sum, we hold that the EPA's decision to forego a revision of the nationwide guidelines in favor of case-by-case RACT certifications was reasonable and not inconsistent with the statutory goal of expeditious attainment. Because the Phase 2 Rule requires each state to verify that previously-required RACT controls still satisfy the RACT requirement, we need not address the EPA's assertion that a new RACT determination will likely \"result in the same or similar control technology as the initial RACT determination under the 1-hour standard because the fundamental control techniques ... are still applicable.\" Id. at 71,654/1. The EPA did not rest the rule upon this ground; each state must \"consider new information\"  information that may prove the EPA wrong  when the state determines whether previously-required controls \"still represent[ ] an appropriate RACT level of control.\" Id. at 71,655/1.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Meeting RACT via NOx SIP Call\n",
      "The NOx SIP Call is a cap-and-trade program that regulates NOx emissions. The program covers 22 states in the Northeast and the District of Columbia, and was intended to address the interstate transport of ozone. See generally Final Rule, Finding of Significant Contribution and Rulemaking for Certain States in the Ozone Transport Assessment Group Region for Purposes of Reducing Regional *1256 Transport of Ozone, 63 Fed.Reg. 57,356 (Oct. 27, 1998); Michigan v. EPA, 213 F.3d 663, 675, 685-86 (D.C.Cir.2000). The NOx SIP Call established for each state a \"NOx emissions budget,\" which limits total emissions during the ozone season. Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,656/3. The EPA also adopted a rule allowing interstate trading of emissions allowances, and all states covered by the NOx SIP Call elected to participate in the interstate program. Thus, a source within a state could meet its emissions target either by installing controls or by purchasing allowances from other sources located anywhere in the region covered by the NOx SIP Call. See id.\n",
      "The Phase 2 Rule provides that to meet the NOx RACT requirement, \"the State need not perform (or submit) a NOx RACT analysis for sources subject to the state's emission cap-and-trade program\" where that program meets the NOx SIP Call requirements or, in states achieving CAIR reductions solely from Electricity Generating Units, CAIR requirements. Id. at 71,652/3. Petitioners and intervenors persuasively challenge this provision as being contrary to the express terms of the statute.\n",
      "Section 172(c)(1) of the Act requires that nonattainment areas achieve \"such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area\" as can be achieved by the adoption of RACT. 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(1). Thus, the RACT requirement calls for reductions in emissions from sources in the area; reductions from sources outside the nonattainment area do not satisfy the requirement. See id.; see also CAA § 182(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(2) (requiring implementation of RACT with respect to certain VOC sources \"in the area\" for moderate and above nonattainment areas). Accordingly, participation in the NOx SIP Call could constitute RACT only if participation entailed at least RACT-level reductions in emissions from sources within the nonattainment area. In the preamble to the proposed rule the EPA stated that \"the overall emission reductions from sources in the NOx SIP Call cap-and-trade program will achieve more emissions reductions in the nonattainment area than would application of RACT to each of those units,\" Proposed Rule to Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, 68 Fed. Reg. 32,802, 32,839 (June 2, 2003) (Proposed Rule). The preamble to the final rule does not go as far. Rather, the final preamble states only that the \"NOx SIP Call is estimated to achieve a beyond-RACT degree of control regionally,\" Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,657. Such regionwide RACT-level reductions in emissions do not meet the statutory requirement that the reductions be from sources in the nonattainment area. Because the EPA has not shown that NOx SIP Call compliance will result in at least RACT-level reductions in emissions from sources within each nonattainment area, the EPA's determination that compliance with the NOx SIP Call satisfies the RACT requirement is inconsistent with the \"in the area\" requirement and thus violates the plain text of § 172(c)(1).\n",
      "In an analogous situation, the court invalidated the CAIR trading program because the EPA's regionwide approach made it impossible to tell whether the rule achieved a specific statutory objective. See North Carolina v. EPA, 531 F.3d 896, 906-08 (D.C.Cir.2008). In developing CAIR, the court explained, the EPA \"did not purport to measure each state's significant contribution to specific downwind nonattainment areas and eliminate them in an isolated state-by-state manner.\" Id. at 907. Despite a statutory provision prohibiting sources \"within the State\" from contributing significantly to nonattainment in \"any other State,\" CAA § 1 10(a)(2)(D), 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(D), the EPA adopted a *1257 regionwide approach to the problem. The court therefore held that the EPA was not exercising its statutory duty, reasoning that \"[i]t is unclear how EPA can assure that the trading programs ... will achieve section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I)'s goals if we do not know what each upwind state's `significant contribution' is to another state.\" 531 F.3d at 908. Similar reasoning applies to the NOx SIP Call. The EPA has not provided assurance that the NOx SIP Call will achieve the Act's goal of \"reductions from existing sources in the area,\" because it has not evaluated the effect of the program on each nonattainment area.\n",
      "The EPA responds that its approach \"gives meaning to the statute's `in the area' language\" because its technical analysis shows that the cap-and-trade programs achieve greater reductions than would the application of RACT-level controls at each source. EPA Br. at 73. However, the EPA's cited support for this proposition is the statement from the preamble to the proposed rule stating the EPA \"believes\" participation would \"achieve more emissions reductions in the nonattainment area than would application of RACT\" to all sources in the area. Proposed Rule, 68 Fed.Reg. at 32,839/2. That statement is unsupported by any record evidence and it does not appear in the preamble to the final rule. The EPA's further response that its technical analysis supports the conclusion that NOx SIP Call participation meets the RACT requirement is no more persuasive. The EPA explains that its analysis showed that sources subject to the NOx SIP Call \"collectively\" would achieve beyond-RACT reductions in emissions. EPA Br. at 83. But regionwide reductions do not satisfy the \"in the area\" requirement. The EPA explains further that it found that purchasing allowances was more costly than installing RACT-level control technology and thus \"most\" sources meeting the NOx SIP call, \"assuming rational economic behavior,\" id., would opt to install controls rather than purchase allowances. This bare assertion is insufficient to demonstrate that NOx SIP Call compliance would lead to RACT-level reductions from sources in the area. Even if most sources in a nonattainment area installed controls rather than purchasing allowances, a small number of sources purchasing allowances and increasing emissions could mean that overall emissions from sources in the area remained unchanged or even increased.\n",
      "The EPA's attempt to show ambiguity in the Act is likewise unavailing. The EPA maintains the statute is ambiguous as to whether RACT must be installed at each source in an area, noting that it has previously approved the concept of averaging emissions within a nonattainment area. The EPA reads the statutory phrase \"as may be obtained\" to indicate that the RACT requirement does not necessarily call for implementation of controls at each and every source, but rather requires an area to achieve at least RACT-level reductions in emissions. Even if the RACT requirement could be met through an emissions-averaging approach within a nonattainment area, averaging emissions across a region does not ensure that any reductions in emissions derive from reductions at sources within a particular area. Even if the EPA were correct that \"nothing in the statute precludes consideration of the air quality impact that controls under a region-wide cap-and-trade program may have on NOx within the nonattainment area,\" EPA Br. at 72, the EPA has not considered the impact of the NOx SIP Call on the air quality within specific nonattainment areas. Therefore the EPA has failed to demonstrate that NOx SIP Call compliance can be equated to RACT compliance.\n",
      "The EPA's reliance on § 172(c)(6) is misplaced. That section provides that *1258 SIPs must include \"enforceable emission limitations, and such other control measures... including economic incentives such as ... auctions of emission rights ... as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(6). The EPA offers that its approach to RACT is consistent with this express authorization of auctions. However, § 172(c)(6) merely authorizes the EPA to approve market-based measures in addition to those controls that are required by CAA § 172(c), including the RACT requirement; it does not authorize the EPA to replace the RACT requirement with a cap-and-trade program as is promulgated in the Phase 2 Rule.\n",
      "The EPA also offers that to the extent individual sources emitting high levels of NOx are in compliance with the NOx SIP Call through the purchase of allowances, the states can define RACT to require greater reductions than are required by the EPA, and they must require beyond-RACT reductions as necessary to achieve timely attainment. The EPA's determination that NOx SIP Call compliance satisfies the RACT requirement is not based on a state choosing to so exercise its discretion. A state's decision to require stricter controls cannot eliminate the defect in the EPA's approach  failing to implement the requirement of at least RACT-level reductions in emissions from sources in the nonattainment area. This part of the Phase 2 Rule must therefore be remanded without vacatur because the EPA may be able to reinstate the provision for most nonattainment areas if, upon conducting a technical analysis, it finds the NOx SIP Call results in greater emissions reductions in a nonattainment area than would be achieved if RACT-level controls were installed in that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Clean Data Policy\n",
      "Under the Act, each nonattainment area must attain the NAAQS by a deadline, known as the \"attainment date,\" which is established by the statute itself for areas subject to Subparts 1 and 2, see CAA § 181, 42 U.S.C. § 7511, and by the EPA for areas subject only to Subpart 1, see CAA § 172, 42 U.S.C. § 7502(a)(2). The Act also provides that the SIP for a nonattainment area subject only to Subpart 1 must \"require reasonable further progress\" (RFP), id. § 7502(c)(2); the SIP for an area in moderate or a greater degree of nonattainment must provide for fixed percentage reductions of VOCs on a specified schedule. CAA §§ 182(b)(1)(A), (c)(2)(B), 42 U.S.C. §§ 7511a(b)(1)(A), (c)(2)(B).[3]\n",
      "In order to ensure these requirements are met, the SIP for any nonattainment area must include \"contingency measures\" to be implemented \"if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the [NAAQS] by the attainment date,\" CAA § 172(c)(9), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(9), and the SIP for a serious, severe, or extreme nonattainment area must also include \"contingency measures\" that will take effect automatically \"if the area fails to meet any applicable milestone,\" CAA § 182(c)(9), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(c)(9).\n",
      "In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA suspended the planning requirements for specified percentage reductions and contingency *1259 measures for each nonattainment area that has attained the 8-hour NAAQS but has not yet been designated an attainment area. 40 C.F.R. § 51.918. The suspension lasts \"until ... the area is redesignated to attainment, at which time the requirements no longer apply; or [until the] EPA determines that the area has violated the 8-hour ozone NAAQS.\" Id. The EPA terms this suspension the \"Clean Data Policy,\" 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,644, because it applies when a nonattainment area produces \"clean\" air quality data. See Memorandum from John S. Seitz, Dir., Office of Air Quality Planning & Standards, RFP, Attainment Demonstration, and Related Requirements for Ozone Nonattainment Areas Meeting the Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, at 5 (May 10, 1995), www.epa.gov/ttn/oarpg/t1/ memoranda/clean15.pdf. It adopted the current version of the policy in 1995 and applied it in rulemakings specific to individual areas under the 1-hour NAAQS; it will similarly determine whether individual areas qualify for the suspension in area-specific rulemakings. 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,-644-45.\n",
      "The NRDC contends the Clean Data Policy conflicts with both the letter and the purpose of the Act. More specifically, the NRDC argues the statutory provisions requiring a SIP to include contingency measures and percentage reductions allow no waivers for an area that has achieved the NAAQS; the only way for an area to be absolved of those requirements is to be redesignated an attainment area. See CAA § 175A(c), 42 U.S.C. § 7505a(c) (\"Until [a maintenance] plan revision is approved and an area is redesignated as attainment ... the requirements of [Part D] shall continue in force and effect\"). Further, the NRDC argues only its reading of the text is consistent with the intent of the Congress that, in order to ensure the air stays clean, no mandatory control requirement be lifted until a maintenance plan is in place.\n",
      "The EPA responds first that the NRDC did not raise before the agency and therefore forfeited its objection to the suspension of the planning requirement for contingency measures. See CAA § 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B) (\"Only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment... may be raised during judicial review\"). We agree. We \"enforce[ ] this provision strictly,\" Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass'n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 462 (D.C.Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted), and although we allow commenters \"some leeway in developing their argument before this court,\" the comment must have provided \"adequate notification of the general substance of the complaint,\" S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882, 891 (D.C.Cir.2006).\n",
      "The NRDC's comments did not provide the EPA adequate notice that it objected to the suspension of the contingency measures. The NRDC did object to the Clean Data Policy, but only to the suspension of the requirements for an attainment demonstration and percentage reductions. The NRDC now contends it objected to the suspension of all Subpart 2 requirements, pointing to its comment that the \"EPA cannot authorize states to simply drop subpart 2 measures when the area is meeting either standard. The Act allows states to move mandated controls to a maintenance contingency plan, but only after the area has been redesignated to attainment.\" Comments of Clean Air Task Force et al., at 48 (Aug. 1, 2003). That comment, however, was made in the context of an objection to a different provision of the proposed rule, namely the EPA's determination that an area not attaining the 1-hour standard but meeting the 8-hour *1260 standard need not submit a maintenance plan meeting the requirements of CAA § 175A. The EPA cannot be expected to take the NRDC's argument, raised in support of one specific objection, and apply it sua sponte to another provision. Because the NRDC did not raise its objection with \"reasonable specificity,\" the Act bars us from considering it. CAA § 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B).\n",
      "On the merits, the EPA maintains the Clean Data Policy does not waive the planning requirements for percentage reductions; instead, it contends, those requirements are by their terms inapplicable when an area meets the applicable NAAQS. See Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,645/1-2, 71,646/1-2.\n",
      "The two planning requirements for percentage reductions are CAA § 182(b)(1), which requires an initial reduction of 15% of VOC emissions in the first six years for an area in moderate or greater nonattainment, and § 182(c)(2)(B), which requires subsequent reductions in VOC emissions averaging 3% per year for an area in serious or greater nonattainment unless an exception applies. See 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(1), (c)(2)(B). As the EPA interprets these provisions, specific percentage reductions are required only as necessary to achieve attainment.\n",
      "We think the statute unclear as to whether those sections apply to an area that is already attaining the NAAQS. For the reasons below, we join the Tenth Circuit in holding the EPA's interpretation is reasonable. See Sierra Club v. EPA, 99 F.3d 1551 (10th Cir.1996).\n",
      "Section 182(b)(1)(A)(i) initially requires the SIP for an area in moderate or greater nonattainment to plan a total reduction in VOC emissions of 15% over six years. 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(1)(A)(i). In the very next sentence, however, it elaborates that a plan should mandate \"such specific annual reductions ... as necessary to attain the [NAAQS] for ozone by the attainment date.\" Id. Moreover, each percentage reduction is linked to the requirement that an area make \"reasonable further progress\" toward attainment. See id. § 7511a(b)(1) (entitled \"Plan provisions for reasonable further progress\"); id. § 7511a(c)(2)(B) (entitled \"Reasonable further progress demonstration\"). \"Reasonable further progress,\" in turn, means \"such annual incremental reductions in emissions ... as are required ... for the purpose of ensuring attainment.\" CAA § 171(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7501(1). The Act is therefore ambiguous as to what reductions are required when no further progress toward attainment is necessary  or, for that matter, possible. The EPA reasonably resolved this ambiguity by concluding the specific percentage reductions are simply inapplicable in that circumstance. As the Tenth Circuit put the matter, \"If a moderate ozone nonattainment area has in fact already attained the ozone standard, it would make little sense to require a state to demonstrate the area will make reasonable progress toward attainment.\" Sierra Club, 99 F.3d at 1557.\n",
      "The EPA's reasoning disposes as well of the NRDC's contentions that the Clean Data Policy unlawfully circumvents the redesignation requirements, CAA § 107(d)(3)(E), 42 U.S.C. § 7407(d)(3)(E), violates the mandate that all Part D requirements remain in force until an area has an approved maintenance plan in place, CAA § 175A(c), 42 U.S.C. § 7505a(c), and disregards the Supreme Court's admonition that the EPA cannot \"render Subpart 2's carefully designed restrictions on EPA discretion utterly nugatory,\" Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 484, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). The Clean Data Policy does not effect a redesignation; an area must still comply with the statutory requirements before it can be redesignated to attainment. Furthermore, Part D  including *1261 Subpart 2  remains in force insofar as it applies but, as we have just seen, the EPA has reasonably concluded the provisions of the Act requiring percentage reductions do not apply to an area that has attained the NAAQS.\n",

      "IV. 15% VOC Reduction\n",
      "CAA section 182(b)(1) requires that, for a moderate nonattainment area, \"no later than 3 years after November 15, 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to provide for volatile organic compound emission reductions, within 6 years after November 15, 1990, of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions, accounting for any growth in emissions after 1990.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7511 a(b)(1)(A)(i). CAA section 182(c), (d) and (e) incorporate the 15% VOC reduction requirement for, respectively, \"serious,\" \"severe\" and \"extreme\" nonattainment areas. Id. § 7511 a(c)-(e). After the initial six-year period, CAA section 182(c), (d) and (e) impose on the same areas an additional RFP requirement that the SIP be revised so that it \"will result in VOC emissions reductions from the baseline emissions ... [of] at least 3 percent of baseline emissions each year,\" \"averaged over each consecutive 3-year period beginning 6 years after November 15, 1990, until the attainment date.\" Id. § 7511 a(c)(2)(B)(i) (imposing requirement on \"serious\" areas); see id. § 7511a(d), (e) (incorporating 3% reduction requirement for \"severe\" and \"extreme\" areas).[4] As used in the cited provisions, \"the term `baseline emissions' means the total amount of actual VOC or NOx emissions from all anthropogenic sources in the area during the calendar year 1990.\" CAA § 182(b)(1)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(1)(B); see also CAA § 182(c)(2)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(c)(2)(B).[5]\n",
      "In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA determined that for all moderate and above areas \"that had not met the 15 percent VOC emission reduction requirement for the 1-hour standard,\" the RFP 15% reduction requirement \"would apply\" under the 8-hour standard. 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,632-33. Conversely, the EPA determined, 8-hour moderate and above areas that had already satisfied the 15% VOC emission reduction for the 1-hour standard will not be subjected a second time to the 15% requirement under the 8-hour standard. Id. at 71,633. Thus, \"[a]reas classified under subpart 2 as moderate that had met the 15 percent VOC emission reduction requirement for the 1-hour standard are treated in the final rule like areas covered under subpart 1,\" while \"[a]reas classified under subpart 2 as serious and above that had met the 15 percent VOC emission reduction requirement for the 1-hour standard would be subject to the RFP requirement in section 172(e) [sic[6]] and the final rule would require them to obtain an average of 3 percent annual reductions of VOC and/or NOx emissions reductions for the first 6 years after the baseline year and every subsequent 3 years out to their attainment *1262 date.\" Id. For both the 15% and the 3% reductions RFP requirements, the Phase 2 Rule provides that the RFP periods \"would be equivalent to the periods Congress established in subpart 2,\" id. at 71,633, running from a new baseline year, i.e., 2002 \"for areas designated nonattainment for the 8-hour ozone NAAQS with an effective date of June 15, 2004,\" id. at 71,637.\n",
      "First, the NRDC argues that the EPA \"illegally waived\" Subpart 2's RFP requirement that each SIP be revised three years after the statute's effective date to provide for a 15% VOC reduction within 6 years after enactment for all areas classified as \"moderate\" and above for ozone.[7]\n",
      "As an initial matter, the EPA did not \"waive\" the 15% requirement but simply determined that, if a State had made the required revision for an area classified as moderate or greater when the one-hour NAAQS took effect, the State did not have to do so a second time after the 8-hour standard took effect. In so doing, the EPA reasonably resolved a statutory ambiguity under step 2 of the framework set out in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). See Natural Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 489 F.3d 1250, 1257 (D.C.Cir.2007) (\"Under Chevron: We first ask `whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue,' in which case we `must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.' If the `statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,' however, we move to the second step and defer to the agency's interpretation as long as it is `based on a permissible construction of the statute.'\" (quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778) (internal quotation marks omitted)). Accordingly, we reject the NRDC's challenge to the VOC reduction provision.\n",
      "The NRDC contends that the EPA's reading of the statute is \"untenable\" because the statute requires that the SIP provide for a 15% reduction from \"baseline emissions\"  which the \"EPA itself defines ... for purposes of the 8-hour ozone standard as emissions in 2002, not 1990\"  and that the reduction be effected \"`within 6 years after' the baseline year  that is, between 2002 and 2008 for the 8-hour standard.\" NRDC Br. at 29. This argument, however, sidesteps the EPA's rationale for its interpretation. The EPA identified a \"gap in the statutory scheme\" because \"[t]he CAA is silent regarding whether a nonattainment area that implements the 15-percent VOC emission reduction of 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(1)(A) must implement that provision a second time if the NAAQS is revised, or instead must implement other RFP provisions that expressly would have applied had there been no revision of the NAAQS.\" EPA Br. at 29. The EPA filled this gap by selecting the latter resolution. As the EPA explained in the Phase 2 Rule, while it \"believes that the CAA is quite clear that the SIP must provide for a 15 percent reduction in baseline VOC emissions for some period after 1990 in an area subject to section 182(b)(1)(A),\" it \"disagrees that the CAA plainly requires that the SIP for an area must require a second 15 percent reduction in VOC baseline emissions under a revised ozone standard.\" 70 Fed. Reg. at 71,635-36 (first emphasis added); see also id. at 71,634 (\"For those areas that have an approved 15 percent plan for their 1-hour ozone SIPs, an additional 15 percent VOC reduction is not necessary.\"). *1263 Because the EPA ended its statutory analysis with the threshold inquiry whether section 182(b)(1)(A)(i) must be applied a second time under its revised standards (concluding it need not), the Agency did not need to decide how to interpret the term \"baseline emissions\" or to identify a baseline year for the purpose of so applying the provision. Further, because it had no need to reach these issues, it did not resolve them arbitrarily or capriciously, as the NRDC asserts, by \"allowing a select group of nonattainment areas to rely on a different baseline from the distant past.\" NRDC Br. at 30-31. Had the EPA required a nonattainment area to undertake a second 15% VOC reduction, it might have been arbitrary to use a different baseline or baseline year from that applicable to areas undertaking the first 15% VOC reduction under the 8-hour standard. But the Agency did not do so and we will not speculate whether it could lawfully have done so.\n",
      "The NRDC also argues that the EPA's 15% approach is inconsistent with its treatment of section 182(c)(2)(B)(i)'s 3% reduction requirement for serious and above areas in that the \"EPA does not read the Act as excusing such 3% continuing emission cuts for serious and above 8-hour nonattainment areas merely because they may have had plans under the 1-hour standard to achieve continuing (i.e. post-1996) cuts of 3%/yr from a 1990 baseline.\" NRDC Br. at 30 n. 8. The 3% provision, however, is fundamentally different from the 15% provision in that the former does not (as does the latter) establish a one-time reduction requirement but instead imposes a continuing obligation that applies to \"each consecutive 3-year period beginning 6 years after November 15, 1990, until the attainment date.\" CAA § 182(c)(2)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(c)(2)(B).\n",
      "Finally, the NRDC asserts that the \"EPA cannot override an express statutory command `simply by asserting that its preferred approach would be better policy,'\" NRDC Br. at 30 (quoting Engine Mfrs. Ass'n v. EPA, 88 F.3d 1075, 1089 (D.C.Cir.1996)), referring to the EPA's observation that its approach \"provides flexibility to States to use a mix of NOx and VOC reductions\" under CAA section 172, 42 U.S.C. § 7502, rather than the required VOC-only reductions mandated by CAA section 182(b)(1)(A)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(b)(1)(A)(1). 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,634. As already explained, however, the EPA's interpretation does not override an express command but rather resolves an ambiguity. Id. at 71,635-36. In commending the flexibility afforded, the EPA merely offered one more reason why its interpretation of the ambiguous statutory language is reasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "V. New Source \"Offset\" Credit for Past Emission Reductions\n",
      "CAA section 172(b) requires that each State containing a nonattainment area submit a nonattainment SIP meeting the requirements of section 172(c) pursuant to a schedule set by the EPA but not later than three years after a nonattainment area is so designated. 42 U.S.C. § 7502(b), (c). Section 172(c)(5) of the Act requires that each nonattainment area SIP \"shall require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area, in accordance with section 7503 of [Title 42].\" Id. § 7502(c)(5). Section 173 sets out the permitting process, known as \"New Source Review\" (NSR), in greater detail, providing that a permit may be issued only if, inter alia, (1) the permitting agency has determined that by the time the source begins operation, sufficient offsetting emissions reductions are obtained that the emission levels from the offsets and the plan provisions represent RFP from the pre-permit levels, id. *1264 § 7503(a)(1)(A),[8] and (2) the proposed source will \"comply with the lowest achievable emission rate\" (LAER), id. § 7503(a)(2).[9] Section 173 further requires that \"[s]uch emission reductions shall be, by the time a new or modified source commences operation, in effect and enforceable and shall assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions of the air pollutant from the new or modified source shall be offset by an equal or greater reduction, as applicable, in the actual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.\" Id. § 7503(c)(1). Subpart 2 specifically applies the NSR requirement to ozone nonattainment areas, CAA § 182(a)(2)(C)(i), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(a)(2)(C)(i), and mandates increasingly stringent offset ratios as the ozone classification increases, CAA § 182(a)(4), (b)(5), (d)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 7511a(a)(4), (b)(5), (d)(2).[10]\n",
      "The Phase 2 Rule allows proposed new and modified sources to meet this offset requirement using credits from sources that shut down or curtailed operations as long ago as 1977. 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,699 (to be codified at 40 C.F.R. § 51.165). The EPA has long allowed emissions reductions occurring before a permit application to qualify as offset credits under specified circumstances. Before 1989, such pre-application emissions reductions could be offset only if the proposed source was \"a replacement for the productive capacity represented by the proposed offset credit.\" Requirements for Implementation Plans; Air Quality New Source Review, 54 Fed. Reg. 27,286, 27,290 (June 28, 1989).[11] The *1265 1989 Rule eliminated this restriction for an area with an approved attainment demonstration. Id. at 27,292. In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA \"lift[ed] the requirement to have an approved attainment plan before using preapplication credits from shutdowns or curtailments as offsets.\" 70 Fed. Reg. at 71,676. The NRDC challenges both the EPA's longstanding policy allowing pre-application reductions as NSR offsets and the EPA's elimination in the Phase 2 Rulemaking of the approved attainment demonstration requirement. We reject as untimely the NRDC's challenge to the general policy of allowing pre-application offset credits but we agree that eliminating the attainment demonstration requirement was arbitrary and capricious and therefore in violation of the APA.\n",
      "CAA section 307(b), which governs judicial review of a rulemaking under the Act, requires that \"[a]ny petition for review ... shall be filed within sixty days from the date notice of such promulgation ... appears in the Federal Register.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1). As already noted, the EPA has allowed emission reductions from pre-application source shutdowns and curtailments to qualify as NSR offset credits since at least 1989. See 54 Fed.Reg. at 27,292. Thus, the deadline for filing a petition for review of section 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C) insofar as it authorizes offset credits for pre-permit emission reductions is long since past and the court lacks jurisdiction to review it. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass'n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 460 (D.C.Cir.1998) (section 7607(b)(1) \"filing period is jurisdictional in nature, and may not be enlarged or altered by the courts\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). Nonetheless, the NRDC contends that the EPA \"reopened\" the 1989 offset policy so as to make its challenge timely. We disagree.\n",
      "\"The reopening doctrine allows an otherwise stale challenge to proceed because `the agency opened the issue up anew,' and then `reexamined ... and reaffirmed its [prior] decision.'\" P & V Enters. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 516 F.3d 1021, 1023-24 (D.C.Cir.2008) (quoting Pub. Citizen v. Nuclear Reg. Comm'n, 901 F.2d 147, 150-51 (D.C.Cir.1990)) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the EPA did not expressly reopen the issue of offsets for pre-application emission reductions. In its proposed rule, the EPA offered two alternative amendments to section 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C), each of which eliminated the attainment demonstration requirement under certain circumstances. See Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) and Nonattainment New Source Review (NSR), 61 Fed.Reg. 38,250, 38,311-14 (July 23, 1996) (Proposed Rules). In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA selected the less restrictive of the two alternatives.[12] Neither alternative proposed changing the regulation insofar as it permits offset of pre-application emission reductions generally or even mentioned the matter. Further, other than eliminating the approved attainment demonstration requirement, the language of amended section 51.165(a)(3)(C) remains substantively identical to the 1989 regulation. Compare 54 Fed.Reg. at 27,299 (§ 51.165(a)(3)(C) as effective June 29, 1989), with 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,699 (§ 51.165(a)(3)(C) as effective Jan. 30, 2006). Accordingly, the subject of allowing offsets in general was not expressly reopened. See Nat'l Ass'n of Reversionary Prop. Owners v. Surface Transp. Bd., 158 F.3d 135, 142 (D.C.Cir. *1266 1998) (\"When an agency invites debate on some aspects of a broad subject, ... it does not automatically reopen all related aspects including those already decided.\")\n",
      "Nor did the EPA constructively reopen the issue, as the NRDC contends. Under some circumstances an issue may be \"deemed to have been constructively reopened even though it was not actually reopened\" in a literal sense. Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. U.S. Dep't of Interior, 88 F.3d 1191, 1214 (D.C.Cir.1996). \"A constructive reopening occurs if the revision of accompanying regulations `significantly alters the stakes of judicial review' as the result of a change that `could have not been reasonably anticipated.'\" Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d 1019, 1025 (D.C.Cir. 2008) (quoting Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1227; Envtl. Def. v. EPA 467 F.3d 1329, 1334 (D.C.Cir.2006)). The EPA's elimination of the attainment determination requirement did not work such a sea change. The basic regulatory scheme remains unchanged: pre-application offsets are permitted if certain requirements are met. The only change is the elimination of the attainment demonstration requirement  which was itself added in 1989 to replace the more stringent requirement that \"the proposed new source [be] a replacement for the shutdown or curtailment.\" 40 C.F.R. § 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C) (1988) (alteration added); see supra note 11. That the NRDC's challenge to the change may have merit, as indeed we conclude infra, does not provide a ground to conclude that the broader issue of allowing any pre-application offsets at all has been reopened. It simply means the particular change it challenges is unlawful. The \"stakes\" here are not quantitatively different from what they were in 1989 when a coalition of environmental groups argued to the EPA that the attainment demonstration requirement itself was inadequate to ensure RFP. See 54 Fed.Reg. at 27,291-92. Yet no one then challenged the general policy allowing pre-application offsets. Further, it could have been \"reasonably anticipated\" at that time that the EPA might subsequently eliminate the attainment demonstration requirement itself in favor of an alternative safeguard which would likewise allow more liberal use of pre-application offset credits, as in fact happened here. In sum, the EPA has done nothing since 1989 to reopen the general issue of allowing pre-application offsets either expressly or constructively.\n",
      "We next address the NRDC's objection to the specific NSR revision that is subject to review in this proceeding  that the EPA erred in eliminating the attainment demonstration requirement. We agree with the NRDC that the EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it did so.\n",
      "In the 1989 rulemaking, the EPA imposed the approved attainment demonstration requirement in order to comply with CAA section 173(a)(1), which allows an NSR permit to issue only if\n",
      "the permitting agency determines that \n",
      "(A) by the time the source is to commence operation, sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been obtained, such that total allowable emissions from existing sources in the region, from new or modified sources which are not major emitting facilities, and from the proposed source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from existing sources allowed under the applicable implementation plan prior to the application for such permit to construct or modify so as to represent (when considered together with the plan provisions required under section 7502 of this title) reasonable further progress (as defined in section 7501 of this title);....\n",
      "42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A) (1989). The EPA concluded that the \"essence of [this] provision is that a new source may be *1267 allowed in a nonattainment area only where its presence would be consistent with RFP toward attainment of the NAAQS\" and that this policy is satisfied if there is in place for the area a \"fully approved SIP\" since, \"[b]y definition, any fully approved SIP has independently assured RFP and attainment.\" 54 Fed.Reg. at 27,292. \"[W]here an attainment demonstration is lacking,\" however, the EPA concluded that \"retention of the current shutdown credit restriction on offset transactions\"  that is, for a pre-permit shutdown, \"the proposed source is a replacement for the productive capacity represented by the proposed offset,\" id. at 27,290  \"is necessary both to assure RFP and to guarantee that a new source does not cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS.\" Id. at 27,292. Nonetheless, when the EPA amended section 51.165(a)(3)(C) in the Phase 2 Rule, it eliminated the fully-approved SIP requirement without adding any other safeguard to ensure that issuing a particular permit is consistent with CAA section 173's mandate that total reductions \"represent ... reasonable further progress.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A). The EPA justified eliminating the requirement on the ground that the 1990 amendments to the Act \"changed the considerations involved\" in that they \"emphasized the emission inventory requirement in section 172(c)(3) as a fundamental tool in air quality planning\" and \"added new provisions keyed to the inventory requirement, including specific reduction strategies and [milestones] that measure progress toward attainment from the base year emissions inventory or subsequent revised inventories\" along with \"several adverse consequences where States fail to meet the planning or emissions reductions requirements.\" 70 Fed. Reg. at 71,677; see also Reconsideration Notice, 72 Fed.Reg. at 31,739. But imposing post hoc sanctions for failing to achieve RFP milestones does not accomplish what CAA section 173 requires, namely, that the EPA ensure that \"by the time the source is to commence operation, sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been obtained\" to produce RFP, 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Because the EPA has not explained how the amended rule, stripped of the approved attainment demonstration requirement, ensures that emission reductions are achieved \"by the time\" the new source begins operation rather than sometime down the road after milestones have been missed, we conclude that eliminating the requirement is arbitrary and capricious. See N. Baja Pipeline, LLC v. FERC, 483 F.3d 819, 821 (D.C.Cir.2007) (under arbitrary and capricious standard, agency conclusions \"must be reasonable and reasonably explained\" (citing Nat'l Fuel Gas Supply Corp. v. FERC, 468 F.3d 831, 839 (D.C.Cir.2006))); Transactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C.Cir. 1996) (\"In order to ensure that an agency's decision has not been arbitrary, we require the agency to have identified and explained the reasoned basis for its decision.\" (citing F.J.

      "VI. NSR Limits on Pollution from New and Modified Major Sources\n",
      "Pursuant to the SIP NSR requirements of CAA Part D, supra pp. 1263-64, the Phase 2 Rule accords a State three years to develop and submit an approvable nonattainment major NSR program for the 8-hour NAAQS. 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,672. In *1268 addition to the Part D requirements for nonattainment areas, however, CAA section 110(a)(2)(c) imposes on States a \"general duty\" to implement a NSR program in their SIPs for all areas, see supra note 10, which \"exists during all periods, including before a State has an approved part D NSR permit program.\" Id. at 71,677-78. Although section 110(a)(2)(c) requires that the SIP contain NSR provisions, it does not specify what NSR requirements apply during the period after an area is designated nonattainment but before the NSR SIP is effective. To fill this gap, the EPA decided in the Phase 2 Rule to retain an interim NSR regime it has used for this purpose since 1979, namely, Appendix S to 40 C.F.R. Part 51, which both establishes interim NSR permitting requirements paralleling the Act's (in section IV.A) and provides for an exemption from the same requirements under certain circumstances (in section VI). The EPA further decided in the Phase 2 Rule, however, to eliminate an existing 18-month time limit on the applicability of Appendix S (including section VI's exemption provision) to a given nonattaiment area. Petitioners NRDC and New Jersey challenge both the EPA's general authority to exempt new sources from permitting requirements under section VI and, more specifically, its decision to eliminate the 18-month limit on such exemptions. We reject the petitioners' objection to the EPA's general exemption authority as untimely but agree that eliminating the 18-month limit violates the \"anti-backsliding\" provision in CAA section 172(e), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(e).\n",
      "In 1979, the EPA codified in its regulations a three year-old \"Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling\" as Appendix S to 40 C.F.R. Part 51 and directed that Appendix S was to \"govern[] permits to construct and operate applied for before the deadline for having a revised SIP in effect that satisfies Part D.\" Approval and Promulgation of Implementation Plans; Statutory Restriction on New Sources Under Certain Circumstances for Nonattainment Areas, 44 Fed.Reg. 38,471, 38,473 (July 2, 1979) (codified at 40 C.F.R. § 52.24(c) (1979) (now § 52.24(k))); see Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling, 44 Fed.Reg. 3274 (Jan. 16, 1979) (codifying interpretive ruling in regulations). In so applying the interpretive rule, the EPA allowed a nonattainment area to avoid, during the period before the SIP was due, the statutory ban on all major source construction or modification in any nonattainment area not subject to a SIP that \"me[t] the requirements of Part D (relating to nonattainment areas).\" See Clean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub.L. No. 95-95, § 108(b), 91 Stat. 685, 694 (Aug. 7, 1977) (establishing construction ban) (1977 CAA Amendments). The EPA noted at the time that the Congress had similarly adopted the rule (\"as may be modified by rule of the Administrator\") to govern NSR during the interim period from enactment of the 1977 CAA amendments until July 1, 1979, when the statutory ban was to take effect. 44 Fed. Reg. at 38,472; 1977 CAA Amendments § 129(a)(1), 91 Stat. at 745 (adopting interpretive rule for interim before ban) (Aug. 7, 1977). The Congress eliminated the construction ban in 1990.

Since that time the EPA has continued to apply Appendix S's NSR requirements in the interim after an area's nonattainment designation and before implementation of a revised SIP. Thus, after the Congress amended the Act in 1990  *1269 adding, inter alia, Subpart 2's ozone-specific requirements  the EPA again affirmed its policy that Appendix S govern during the period between nonattainment designation and SIP approval and implementation.

In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA added a third condition so that the reformulated provision now exempts new sources from the permitting requirements in section IV.A \"if the conditions in paragraphs VI.A through C are met,\" namely:\n",
      "A. The new source meets the applicable SIP emission limitations.\n",
      "B. The new source will not interfere with the attainment date specified in the SIP under section 110 of the Act.\n",
      "C. The Administrator has determined that conditions A and B of this section are satisfied and such determination is published in the Federal Register.\n",
      "70 Fed.Reg. at 71,704 (codified at 40 C.F.R. pt 51, app. S., § VI (2009)). The EPA further eliminated the 18-month limit on the applicability of Appendix S (including section VI) to a pre-SIP nonattainment area. 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,677; see 40 C.F.R. § 52.24(k) (2009).\n",
      "As noted above, petitioners NRDC and New Jersey challenge the EPA's authority generally to exempt an area from Appendix S's permitting requirements and specifically the EPA's removal of the 18-month limit. We address each in turn.\n",
      "First, we consider the general challenge to the EPA's exemption authority and conclude that it is time-barred. Under CAA section 307(b), any objection to the exemption policy was required to be raised in a petition for review \"filed within sixty days from the date notice of [its] promulgation ... appears in the Federal Register,\" 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1). In this case the triggering date was July 2, 1979, when the EPA published its final rule promulgating 40 C.F.R. § 52.24(c) (1979) (now 52.24(k)), which directed that \"[t]he Emission Offset Interpretative Ruling, 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix S\"  which, as then codified, contained the exemption provision in section VI, 44 Fed.Reg. at 3285  \"governs permits to construct and operate applied for before the deadline for having a revised SIP in effect that satisfies Part D.\" 44 Fed.Reg. at 38,473 (codified at 40 C.F.R. § 52.24(c) (1979) (now 52.24(k))). It was on that date that the EPA unequivocally asserted its authority to exempt new sources from permitting requirements under section VI. Thus, the petitioners' challenge to such authority in this case comes almost thirty years late and we are precluded from considering it. See Motor & Equip. Mfrs. Ass'n, 142 F.3d at 460. Nonetheless, the petitioners again (as with the emission offset authority issue treated supra) seek to circumvent the statutory time limit by invoking the reopening doctrine. Once again their attempt is unavailing.\n",
      "The petitioners contend the EPA implicitly reopened the question of its exemption authority because during the rulemaking, *1270 the Agency sought comment on an alternative exemption proposal which it subsequently declined to adopt. See Edison Elec. Inst. v. EPA, 996 F.2d 326, 332 (D.C.Cir.1993) (\"By soliciting comments on the existing ... regulations and advancing a possible `alternative approach' ..., the EPA clearly provided the type of `opportunity for renewed comment and objection' that suffices to restart the statutory period for seeking review.\") (quoting Ohio v. EPA, 838 F.2d 1325, 1328 (D.C.Cir.1988)). Specifically, the petitioners argue that the EPA reopened the question of its exemption authority when it \"proposed to remove the general waiver language from Appendix S entirely, and replace it with a `transitional' program that would only allow relief from NSR in a limited group of areas that, among other things, submitted plans by 2004 adequate to attain standards by 2007\"  a proposal the EPA subsequently declined to adopt. NRDC Br. at 41 (citing 68 Fed.Reg. at 32,846-48) (emphases in brief). As the petitioners' characterization demonstrates, however, the EPA reopened only the question of how broadly it should exercise its exemption authority and not whether it had such authority in the first place. The abandoned proposal would have replaced section VI's exemption provisions with a \"transitional\" program, which would, like section VI, provide exemptions from section IV.A's NSR requirements but would allow the exemptions for a narrower class of \"eligible\" areas. See Proposed Rule To Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, 68 Fed. Reg. 32,802, 32,846-47 (June 2, 2003) (setting out eligibility requirements for transitional program). Thus, the EPA's alternative proposal did not implicitly reopen the question of its statutory authority vel non to grant any NSR exemptions but only whether section VI as previously applied might violate the Act by making exemptions too broadly available. Because the EPA did not seek comment on its general authority to exempt areas from the permitting requirements, this case is plainly distinguishable from Edison Electric Institute, in which the EPA \"explicitly invited comments on the precise question for which petitioners [there sought] review.\" Edison Elec. Inst., 996 F.2d at 332. Accordingly, we conclude that the issue of the EPA's general exemption authority is foreclosed under CAA section 307(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(b)(1).\n",
      "The petitioners also argue that the EPA constructively reopened the entire exemption provision \"by dramatically expanding its scope and effect\" when it eliminated the 18-month limit on Section VI exemptions. NRDC Br. at 41(citing Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1226-27); see also NRDC Reply Br. at 18. The extension of the exemption term, however, did not \" `significantly alter[ ] the stakes of judicial review' as the result of a change that `could have not been reasonably anticipated.'\" Sierra Club v. EPA, 551 F.3d at 1025 (quoting Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1227; Envtl. Def., 467 F.3d at 1334). In fact, when first codified in 1979, the interpretive ruling lacked such a limit  yet its general exemption authority went unchallenged. Further, an exemption from NSR for even 18 months, if unlawful, seems worth challenging in its own right  as it could have been when the 18-month limit was added in 1980. To the extent that the EPA's removal of the limit extends the exemption period, the extension is subject to direct challenge in this proceeding and we next address the petitioners' challenge thereto.\n",
      "The petitioners contend that the EPA's elimination of the 18-month limit on NSR exemptions violates CAA section 172(e), the Act's \"anti-backsliding\" provision. Section 172(e) provides that if the EPA \"relaxes a national primary ambient air quality standard,\" it must \"promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which *1271 have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation\" which \"shall provide for controls which are not less stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7502(e). Although section 172(e) expressly applies only when the EPA \"relaxes\" a NAAQS, the EPA has interpreted the language to also apply when it strengthens a NAAQS  as it did when it adopted the 8-hour ozone standard  reasoning that \"if Congress intended areas to remain subject to the same level of control where a NAAQS was relaxed, they also intended that such controls not be weakened where the NAAQS is made more stringent.\" Final Rule To Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard  Phase 1, 69 Fed.Reg. 23,951, 23,972 (Apr. 30, 2004) (Phase 1 Rule). In South Coast Air Quality Management District v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882 (D.C.Cir.2006), we upheld this interpretation, id. at 900, and also concluded that NSR is a \"control\" subject to section 172(e)'s backsliding prohibition, id. at 902. Accordingly, the EPA's elimination of the 18-month exemption limit violates section 172(e) if the resulting NSR requirement is \"less stringent\" than the existing requirement. Insofar as Appendix S now provides for waiver of NSR for an unlimited time pending SIP approval, it is plainly \"less stringent\" than the previous version which limited an NSR waiver to an 18-month term. As the petitioners argue, the EPA's revision could delay implementing NSR controls in eligible nonattainment areas for years beyond the previous 18-month limit. Accordingly, we conclude that the revision constitutes backsliding in violation of section 172(e).\n",
      "The EPA offers three defenses of its revision. First, because the EPA established the time limit to allow a newly-designated nonattainment area a reasonable time to develop a SIP before the statutory construction ban applied, see 45 Fed.Reg. at 65,209, the EPA contends that it reasonably removed the 18-month limitation after the Congress repealed the new source construction ban in 1990. The EPA might have done so but for section 172(e)'s unequivocal backsliding constraint, which plainly prohibits a \"less stringent\" NSR control  precisely what the revision produced. Second, the EPA asserts \"there is no basis to speculate\" that it will grant waivers for the entire period before SIP approval because \"it `would be highly disinclined to grant a waiver where the SIP submission deadline has passed and EPA had not received the required submission.'\" EPA Br. at 102-03 (quoting 72 Fed.Reg. at 31,745-46). We do not speculate, however, in concluding that, notwithstanding the EPA's promised discretionary restraint, the revised section VI will produce some waivers lasting beyond the previously prescribed 18-month period and thus impose a control less stringent than before. This result contravenes section 172(e). Nor are we persuaded by the EPA's third argument, that the revision's new, third \"pre-condition\"  that the EPA determine that the existing two pre-conditions (satisfaction of applicable SIP emission limitations and non-interference with SIP's attainment date) have been met and publish the determination in the Federal Register  \"tightened\" Part VI's requirements. EPA Br. at 103. The new pre-condition simply formalized and made explicit what was already implicitly required  that the EPA find the existing two pre-conditions satisfied. Thus, the additional pre-condition produced no \"tightening\" effect; on the contrary, it did nothing to counteract the indisputably relaxing effect of removing the 18-month limit.\n",

      "VII. Baton Rouge's Reformulated Gasoline Requirement\n",
      "The Chamber of Greater Baton Rouge and affiliated petitioners (Chamber) contend the EPA arbitrarily and capriciously *1272 concluded that the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area (Baton Rouge) is a \"covered area\" under CAA section 211(k), 42 U.S.C. § 7545(k), and therefore subject to a statutory ban on the sale to consumers of conventional gasoline.[14] We conclude that the EPA correctly determined the statutory definition of \"covered area\" is ambiguous as to Baton Rouge under Chevron step 1 and that it reasonably resolved the ambiguity under Chevron step 2.\n",
      "CAA section 211(k)(1) authorizes the EPA to \"promulgate regulations ... establishing requirements for reformulated gasoline to be used in gasoline-fueled vehicles in specified nonattainment areas.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7545(k)(1). Section 211(k)(5) makes unlawful \"[t]he sale or dispensing by any person of conventional gasoline to ultimate consumers in any covered area\"  necessitating the use of reformulated gasoline instead. Id. § 7545(k)(5)(A). Section 211(k)(10), in turn, designates as a \"covered area\" each of nine specific, high ozone areas and further provides: \"Effective one year after the reclassification of any ozone nonattainment area as a Severe ozone nonattainment area under section 7511(b) of this title, such Severe area shall also be a `covered area' for purposes of this subsection.\" Id. § 7545(k)(10)(D).\n",
      "In 1991, the EPA classified Baton Rouge as a \"serious\" ozone nonattainment area under the 1-hour standard. On April 24, 2003, the EPA reclassified Baton Rouge as \"severe,\" effective June 23, 2003, pursuant to the bump-up provision, CAA § 181(b)(2), 42 U.S.C. § 7511(b)(2), because Baton Rouge failed to reach attainment by its November 15, 1999 attainment date. Notice of Withdrawal of October 2, 2002, Attainment Date Extension, Determination of Nonattainment as of November 15, 1999, and Reclassification of the Baton Rouge Ozone Nonattainment Area, 68 Fed.Reg. 20,077 (Apr. 24, 2003) (effective June 23, 2003). At that time, the EPA advised that \"under Section 211(k) of the Act the use of reformulated gasoline (RFG) will be required in the Baton Rouge area beginning one year from the effective date of this rule,\" that is, as of June 23, 2004. Id. at 20,080. On April 30, 2004, the EPA designated Baton Rouge as nonattainment under the 8-hour standard and classified it as \"marginal,\" effective June 15, 2004. Air Quality Designations and Classifications for the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards; Early Action Compact Areas With Deferred Effective Dates, 69 Fed.Reg. 23,858, 23,907 (Apr. 30, 2004).\n",
      "The Chamber filed a request for extension of the deadline to commence using RFG or waiver of the RFG requirement, which the EPA denied in a letter dated May 5, 2004. The Chamber then petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for review of the denial and the Fifth Circuit stayed the RFG deadline on June 18, 2004. On August 2, 2004 the Fifth Circuit granted a joint motion to stay its proceedings \"pending the outcome of the administrative decision making process,\" with the RFG deadline stay to remain in effect during remand. City of Baton Rouge v. EPA, No. 04-60408 (5th Cir. Aug. 2, 2004).\n",
      "In the Phase 2 Rule, the EPA concluded that an area such as Baton Rouge, which automatically became a \"covered area\" (subject to the RFG requirement) on the one-year anniversary of its bump-up to \"severe,\" should remain subject to the RFG requirement notwithstanding its classification to a less-than-severe status under the 8-hour standard and the subsequent revocation of the 1-hour standard: *1273 \"EPA has determined that bump-up areas that lose their severe classification based solely on revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS should remain RFG covered areas at least until they are redesignated to attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS.\" 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,686.[15] The EPA concluded that \"section 211(k)(10)(D) is ambiguous on the issue of whether a bump-up area continues to be a covered area when it is no longer classified as severe\" and that therefore \"EPA has discretion to determine whether section 211(k)(10)(D) authorizes removal of a bump-up area from the RFG program when it is no longer classified as severe, and to set appropriate criteria for such removal.\" Id. The EPA explained that it \"d[id] not believe that Congress would have intended that removal of the severe classification based solely on revocation of the less protective 1-hour NAAQS should result in backsliding of the RFG requirement.\" Id. The Agency further found it \"instructive\" that \"if EPA had never revised the 1-hour NAAQS[,] ... the area would continue to be a covered area at least until it was redesignated to attainment for the 1-hour NAAQS.\" Id. Accordingly, because \"[h]ere, the removal of the severe classification is through revocation of the 1-hour NAAQS, not through redesignation to 1-hour attainment,\" the EPA determined that \"the removal of the severe classification for these areas as a result of revocation of the 1-hour standard should not lead to removal of the RFG requirement.\" Id. The Chamber offers three arguments against the EPA's interpretation. We address and reject each argument in turn.\n",
      "First, the Chamber contends that at Chevron step 1 Baton Rouge never became a \"covered area\" because the plain and unambiguous language of the statutory definition requires that a \"covered area\" be \"a `Severe area' that remains severe `one year after the reclassification,'\" Chamber Br. at 15 (quoting CAA § 211(k)(10)(D), 42 U.S.C. § 7545(k)(10)(D)), that is, on June 23, 2004, on which date Baton Rouge was no longer a severe area as it had become a marginal area on June 15, 2004. The EPA does not quibble with the Chamber's interpretation of the statutory language to require that the area remain classified as \"severe\" on the one-year anniversary of the reclassification. See EPA Br. at 111 (\"[O]nce an area is reclassified as `severe,' the only other precondition to becoming `covered' is that the area remain in severe nonattainment status for one year.\") (emphasis in original). The EPA points out, however, that as of the one-year anniversary of the bump-up  June 23, 20004  Baton Rouge was not only a marginal area under the 8-hour standard but was also a severe area under the 1-hour standard, which was not revoked until June 15, 2005, almost a year later. See Phase 1 Rule, 69 Fed.Reg. at 23,954 (\"We will revoke the 1-hour standard in full, including the associated designations and classifications, 1 year following the effective date of the designations for the 8-hour NAAQS.\"). Thus, the EPA reasonably determined that under the plain language of the statute, Baton Rouge was a severe area as of June 23, 2004 and became a \"covered area\" on that date.[16]\n",
      "*1274 Second, the Chamber asserts at Chevron step 2 that even if the definition of \"covered area\" is ambiguous, the EPA resolved the ambiguity unreasonably in two respects. The Chamber first argues the EPA improperly relied on the Supreme Court's decision in Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass'ns, 531 U.S. 457, 121 S.Ct. 903, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001). In support of its interpretation, the EPA cited Whitman's \"caution[ ] ... against EPA making subpart 2 `abruptly obsolete,'\" 70 Fed. Reg. at 71,686 (quoting Whitman, 531 U.S. at 485, 121 S.Ct. 903), observing that, \"[a]lthough the RFG requirement itself is not set forth in subpart 2, the requirement to use it in severe bump-up areas is tied directly to the classifications that arise by operation of subpart 2\" and therefore \"it would appear that the Supreme Court's caution should be as relevant for RFG bump-up areas as it is for the subpart 2 control obligations.\" Id. Notwithstanding the Chamber's contrary assertions, the EPA reasonably determined that \"the inclusion of a bump-up area in the RFG program is integrally tied to the subpart 2 provisions that establish the original classification and attainment date for an area and its later reclassification,\" id., which provisions cause an area to become a \"covered\" RFG area by operation of law. Accordingly, the EPA reasonably relied on Whitman's general admonition to preserve Subpart 2 to support the Agency's particular determination that the effects of the integrally connected provisions should remain intact following conversion to the 8-hour standard.\n",
      "The Chamber also asserts the EPA's interpretation falters at Chevron step 2 because the Agency unreasonably relied on \"the very same provisions it referred to in the Phase 1 Rule at 69 Fed.Reg. 23972,\" which provisions, the Chamber maintains, \"did not support the Phase 1 Rule, nor do they support the imposition of RFG.\" Chamber Br. at 22-23 (citing 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,686). The Chamber examines each of the statutes cited in the Phase 1 Rule and asserts, correctly, that none of them directly relates to the RFG requirement. See id. at 23-24. The Chamber makes too much, however, of the EPA's citation to the Phase 1 Rule. The EPA was simply referring readers \"[f]or further discussion of the reasoning behind anti-backsliding provisions in the Phase 1 Rule\" because the Agency also relied on the anti-backsliding rationale for its interpretation of the \"covered area\" definition in the Phase 2 Rule.[17]See 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,686.\n",
      "*1275 Having rejected the Chamber's contrary arguments, we conclude that the EPA's statutory interpretation readily satisfies Chevron step 2. In upholding the EPA's interpretation as reasonable, we, like the Agency, find it \"instructive\" that but for the happenstance of the EPA's adoption of 8-hour standards, the Chamber would have no statutory basis to dispute that Baton Rouge is a covered RFG area under the mandatory bump-up and RFG provisions because Baton Rouge remained a severe one-hour area for one year following its classification as such. See 70 Fed. Reg. at 71,686 (quoted supra pp. 1272-73).\n",
      "Finally, the Chamber contends the EPA was arbitrary and capricious in not making a specific determination that RFG would \"protect the public health\" in Baton Rouge and asserts that in fact RFG will interfere with the area's progress toward attainment, thereby harming the public health. The Chamber first asserts that the EPA was required by CAA section 109(b)(1) to make a specific finding that requiring RFG \"protects the public health\" of Baton Rouge, citing 42 U.S.C. § 7409(b)(1) (\"National primary ambient air quality standards, prescribed under subsection (a) of this section shall be ambient air quality standards the attainment and maintenance of which in the judgment of the Administrator, based on such criteria and allowing an adequate margin of safety, are requisite to protect the public health.\"). The Chamber further argues that requiring RFG in Baton Rouge will interfere with the area's attainment because studies have shown RFG increases NOx levels and Baton Rouge's SIP strategy for reducing ozone relies largely on reducing NOx (and not VOCs). By interfering with attainment, the Chamber contends, RFG in fact endangers the public health. As an initial matter, the Chamber's objections based on harm to public health and interference with RFP and attainment are forfeited because they were not raised before the Agency. See CAA § 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B) (\"Only an objection to a rule or procedure which was raised with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment (including any public hearing) may be raised during judicial review.\"). To the extent Baton Rouge argues that RFG will not improve the public health, the EPA adequately addressed these objections and reasonably determined they may best be resolved through individual waiver requests.[18]\n",
      "In the Phase 2 Rulemaking, the Baton Rouge Clean Air Coalition asserted that RFG use in Baton Rouge would \"provide no measurable benefits for NOx,\" less than 2 tons per day of VOC reductions, and \"an ozone benefit ... of around 0.26 ppb,\" and asked whether these data \"qualify as an `absurd result' and [would] be subject to consideration for waiver.\" Letter from Mike D. McDaniel, Executor Director, Baton Rouge Clean Air Coalition to U.S. EPA at 4 (July 30, 2003); see Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,687-88. In response, the EPA noted that Baton Rouge had \"submitted requests for an RFG waiver and for a waiver of the RFG oxygen content requirement, which are currently before the Agency.\" 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,688. Based on its determination that \"the transition to the more protective 8-hour standard should [not] result in less restrictive requirements for RFG than would apply if the EPA had never revised the 1-hour standard,\" the EPA advised that \"[t]he appropriate mechanism to address Baton Rouge's concerns is ... in the context of Baton Rouge's petitions for relief *1276 under the RFG program, and not by establishing different, less restrictive RFG requirements as part of the transition to the 8-hour standard.\" Id. Baton Rouge's waiver request is ongoing before the Agency with judicial review available in the Fifth Circuit. The EPA's decision to address site-specific data and concerns in an individual waiver proceeding, rather than in the general rulemaking, is reasonable. Cf. Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. EPA, 286 F.3d 554, 566 (D.C.Cir.2002) (upholding as reasonable EPA's decision to address \"color pollution\" \"on a case-by-case basis through individual [National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System] permits or, when appropriate, through local limits\" rather than \"to establish nationwide standards for discharge of `color'\").\n",
      "\n",
      "VIII. Conclusion\n",
      "In sum, we hold (1) the Phase 2 Rule violates the Act by allowing participation in the NOx SIP Call to satisfy the requirement that a nonattainment area mandate such reductions as can be achieved by the application of RACT, (2) the EPA acted arbitrarily when it eliminated the requirement that an attainment demonstration be approved for an area before a new source would be allowed to use a past emission reduction to offset new emissions, and (3) the elimination of the 18-month time limit for NSR waivers under Appendix S violates the anti-backsliding provision of the Act. In light of the likelihood the EPA will be unable to cure the backsliding inherent in the removal of the 18-month time limit, we vacate that provision of the Phase 2 Rule and remand it to the EPA. See Ill. Pub. Telecomms. Ass'n v. FCC, 123 F.3d 693, 693 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\"When this court remands a rule ... with little or no prospect of the rule's being readopted upon the basis of a more adequate explanation of the agency's reasoning, the practice of the court is ordinarily to vacate the rule\"). We remand to the EPA without vacatur the other two provisions of the Phase 2 Rule we hold invalid. We defer consideration of the Phase 2 Rule and Reconsideration Notice insofar as they relate to the CAIR program, and we deny the petitions in all other respects.\n",
      "So ordered.\n",
      "ROGERS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n",
      "I join the court's opinion regarding challenges to the Phase 2 Rule[1] except in three respects. The petitioners met their burden to show reopening of both the general policies allowing new and modified sources to use offset credits from past emission reductions to meet the requirements of section 173 of the Clean Air Act (\"CAA\"), 42 U.S.C. § 7503, and EPA's authority to waive interim new source review (\"NSR\") Appendix S permitting requirements, 40 C.F.R. pt. 51, app. S, § VI. Additionally, the challenge to the contingency measure element of the Clean Data Policy was not forfeited because comments submitted by the NRDC and other environmental groups put EPA on notice of the challenge, which EPA, in fact, addressed.\n",

      "The principles underlying the reopening doctrine are well-established. It is only their application that may obfuscate the reality of what an agency regulatory action entails. This is the situation here.\n",
      "*1277 Under the reopening doctrine, which is an exception to the statutory limits on the period for seeking judicial review of agency action, see Env. Defense v. EPA, 467 F.3d 1329, 1333 (D.C.Cir.2006), an issue is reopened when an agency implicitly or explicitly, see West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 872 (D.C.Cir.2004), solicits comment on a preexisting regulation or \"otherwise indicates its willingness to reconsider such a regulation by inviting and responding to comments,\" Kennecott Utah Copper Corp. v. Dep't of Interior, 88 F.3d 1191, 1213 (D.C.Cir.1996). The \"entire context\" must \"demonstrate[ ] that the agency has undertaken a serious, substantive reconsideration of the [existing] rule.\" P & V Enters. v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, 516 F.3d 1021, 1024 (D.C.Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original). Also, when a new rule \"increase[s] the significance\" of preexisting regulations, Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1216, and thus \"significantly alters the stakes of judicial review,\" the new rule \"constructively reopens\" the previously settled issue, id. at 1227. Applying these principles demonstrates EPA reopened consideration of two subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "A.\n",
      "Offset credits. The Phase 2 Rule allows new and modified sources to meet emissions offset requirements under CAA § 173(c), 42 U.S.C. § 7503(c), by using credits from sources that shut down or curtailed operations as long ago as August 7, 1977. See 40 C.F.R. § 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C)(1)(ii); Op. at 1264-65. Contrary to the court's suggestion, this court's opinion in Kennecott makes clear that the fact that the \"basic regulatory scheme remains unchanged,\" Op. at 1266, is not dispositive of whether an issue has been constructively reopened. See Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1219. Analyzing the reopening doctrine at that level of generality begs the question. If \"adding new terms to [an] old rule\" can result in reopening, see id., then so can removing old terms from an old rule, at least where those old terms were an important part of the underlying regulatory scheme. Furthermore, Kennecott also makes clear that the question whether the stakes are \"quantitatively different,\" Op. at 1266-67, does not turn on whether the petitioner or another failed to object to a different change earlier. See Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1226-27. Although a 1989 Rule made it easier to use pre-application offset credits, see Requirements for Implementation Plans, Air Quality New Source Review, Final Rule, 54 Fed.Reg. 27,286, 27,292 (June 28, 1989) (\"1989 Rule\"), the concomitant addition of the attainment demonstration requirement mitigated the impact of the change and may well have meant it was not \"worth challenging,\" Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1227, the regime as a whole. However, once EPA eliminated the attainment demonstration requirement and failed to replace it with a comparable substitute, the need for a challenge by environmental groups such as the NRDC arose because EPA had \"dramatically expanded authority to use [pre-application offset] credits,\" NRDC Br. at 44. This change meant that \"a major new pollution source [may] add substantial new emissions to a nonattainment area without any contemporaneous offsets, even when the state has no plan for meeting standards and no idea of what total reductions are needed to attain standards.\" Id. at 45.\n",
      "Both EPA's and the court's analysis show that a constructive reopening occurred. See Op. at 1266-67. In announcing the 1989 Rule, EPA stated that to comply with the reasonable further progress (\"RFP\") requirement of CAA § 173(a)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A), the restriction on pre-application offset credit was \"necessary both to assure RFP and to guarantee that a new source does *1278 not cause or contribute to a violation of the NAAQS,\" 1989 Rule, 54 Fed.Reg. at 27,292. This evaluation by EPA supports the conclusion that environmental groups would have determined in 1989 that it was not worth challenging the regulatory scheme as significant limits remained in place. Once EPA removed this \"necessary,\" id., limitation \"without adding any other safeguard to ensure that issuing a particular permit is consistent with section 173's mandate that total reductions `represent... reasonable further progress,'\" Op. at 1267 (quoting CAA § 173(a)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A)), the stakes of judicial review were significantly altered. The court's speculation today  that it \"could have been `reasonably anticipated' in 1989 that EPA might eliminate the attainment demonstration requirement,\" Op. at 1266  proves too much. Given EPA's evaluation in the 1989 Rule of the importance of restricting the availability of pre-application offset credits, environmental groups had no reason then to lodge a challenge based on the possibility that EPA might, perhaps, at some point in the future reverse course. Cf. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882, 898 (D.C.Cir.2006). Although the reopening doctrine may not apply if the change could have been \"reasonably anticipated,\" see Env. Defense, 467 F.3d at 1333, such a limit on the doctrine does not go so far as preventing review because a petitioner might have guessed EPA could later change its evaluation of what was necessary. Such an approach would render the constructive reopening precedents nugatory.\n",
      "On the merits, the NRDC persuasively contends that \"EPA's final rule ... unlawfully permits total allowable emissions after the new source starts operating to be higher than emissions from existing sources before the new source applied for its permit.\" NRDC Br. at 42-43. The Phase 2 Rule's allowance of offset credit for pre-application shutdowns and curtailments is contrary to the plain text of the CAA and fails under Chevron step one. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Section 173(a)(1)(A) requires that \"sufficient offsetting reductions\" shall be obtained \"such that total allowable emissions from existing sources in the region, from new or modified sources which are not major emitting facilities, and from the proposed source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from existing sources ... prior to the application for such permit to construct or modify so as to represent ... reasonable further progress.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A). Section 173(c)(1) requires that offsets come from \"an equal or greater reduction, as applicable, in actual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.\" Id. § 7503(c)(1) (emphasis added); see also H.R.Rep. No. 101-490, pt. 1 (1990) (referring to reductions in \"actual emissions\"). Under the Phase 2 Rule, new and modified major sources may claim offset credit from reductions in emissions resulting from the shutdown or curtailment of operations from more than three decades ago. The absence of any meaningful time limit means the Rule is inconsistent with CAA § 173(c)(1)'s requirement that new sources' emissions \"shall be offset\" by an equal or greater reduction in \"actual emissions,\" 42 U.S.C. § 7503(c)(1). Congress is presumed, absent any indication to the contrary, to have intended the ordinary meaning of the word \"actual,\" as \"existing or occurring at the time,\" MERRIAM WEBSTER'S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY (10th ed.1993) (emphasis added); accord WEBSTER'S THIRD NEW INT'L DICTIONARY (1993). See Engine Mfrs. Ass'n v. S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist., 541 U.S. 246, 252, 124 S.Ct. 1756, 158 L.Ed.2d 529 (2004). Congress has given no indication in the *1279 surrounding text, or elsewhere, that it intended to depart from the common meaning of \"actual.\" Hence, allowing an offset for no-longer-existing emissions from sources closed decades ago is inconsistent with the statutory text.\n",
      "EPA offers that because the Phase 2 Rule requires the old offsets to be included in the area's emissions inventory, allowance of pre-application offset credits is consistent with the requirement in CAA § 173(a)(1)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(A), that offsets ensure reasonable further progress toward attainment. See Phase 2 of the Final Rule to Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, Final Notice of Reconsideration, 72 Fed.Reg. 31,727, 31,742/3 (June 8, 2007) (\"Final Notice of Reconsideration\"). But using decades-old emissions in an accounting exercise cannot render those emissions \"actual\" as that word is commonly understood. Likewise, EPA offers that because \"[f]rom an air quality planning perspective\" emissions from the previously shutdown or curtailed sources had impacted the area's designations as nonattainment, they are \"actual emissions reductions.\" Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,677; see also Final Notice of Reconsideration, 72 Fed.Reg. at 31,742/3. But that emissions were \"actual\" as long ago as the 1970s does not mean they continue to meet the common understanding of \"actual\" years later when a source applies for a construction or modification permit.\n",
      "Because the flaws in this part of the Phase 2 Rule, see 40 C.F.R. § 51.165(a)(3)(ii)(C)(1)(ii), cannot be remedied by further explanation by EPA, it must be vacated. See Allied-Signal, Inc. v. U.S. Nuclear Reg. Comm'n, 988 F.2d 146, 150-51 (D.C.Cir.1993). To what extent the court's holding that elimination of the requirement of an approved attainment demonstration is arbitrary and capricious under CAA § 307(d)(9)(A), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(9)(A), Op. at 1266-67, will result in a different outcome than vacatur remains to be seen upon remand.\n",
      "\n",
      "B.\n",
      "NSR waiver authority. Section 110(a)(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(C), does not specify what NSR requirements apply in the period between an area's designation as nonattainment and approval of its NSR state implementation plan (\"SIP\"). Prior to promulgating the Phase 2 Rule, EPA had filled this statutory gap by retaining Appendix S's interim NSR regime, which by its terms could apply for only 18 months. Given the limited duration of its effect, the previous regulation \"may not have been worth challenging,\" Kennecott, 88 F.3d at 1227. However, EPA's decision to eliminate the 18-month limitation \"alter[ed] the stakes of judicial review,\" id. By parity of reasoning, if there was a reopening in Kennecott where industry petitioners faced a new requirement creating the possibility of the imposition of additional penalties, then there was a constructive reopening where EPA's change meant NSR controls could be postponed indefinitely, thereby dramatically changing the scope and effect of the waiver provision.\n",
      "Additionally, EPA constructively reopened the issue of its NSR waiver authority when it proposed to remove the general waiver provision in Appendix S and replace it with a \"transitional\" program in which waivers would be available in only a limited set of nonattainment areas. See Proposed Rule to Implement the 8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard, 68 Fed.Reg. 32,802, 32,846-48 (June 2, 2003) (\"NPRM\"). EPA has described the proposal as a \"major rewrite of [A]ppendix S.\" Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,674. In explaining the 2003 proposal, EPA stated \"we do not believe that areas *1280 not meeting the transitional approach would be able to ensure that they were implementing an NSR program `as necessary' to ensure the attainment of NAAQS....\" NPRM, 68 Fed.Reg. at 32,848 (quoting CAA § 110(a)(2)(C), 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(C)). In other words, EPA expressed doubt about a broad waiver's consistency with statutory mandates in certain circumstances. Although it ultimately rejected the proposed alternative, EPA reopened the issue of its authority to waive interim NSR requirements by raising the question whether a broad waiver would be inconsistent with the CAA. See Edison Elec. Inst. v. EPA, 996 F.2d 326, 332 (D.C.Cir.1993).\n",
      "On the merits, the challenge by the NRDC and the State of New Jersey to EPA's authority to exempt new sources from the interim NSR permitting requirements is unpersuasive. They contend that \"[w]here Congress has intended to allow exceptions to NSR requirements, it has expressly said so,\" NRDC Br. at 38 (citing, inter alia, CAA § 173(a)(1)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7503(a)(1)(B), excepting economic development zones). However, EPA persuasively responds that the waivers are the product of EPA's gap-filling authority. See Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843-45, 104 S.Ct. 2778. In exercising that authority, EPA established requirements \"substantially similar to the requirements of part D,\" CAA § 171 et seq., 42 U.S.C. § 7501 et seq., although not identical to the \"major NSR\" program under Part D. See Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,678/1. The \"minor NSR\" program under CAA § 110(a)(2)(C) calls for \"regulation of the modification and construction of any stationary source within the areas covered by the plan as necessary to assure that [NAAQS] are achieved.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7410(a)(2)(C) (emphasis added). EPA thus could reasonably conclude that the interim NSR requirements are inapplicable when the exemption conditions are met. In those instances, a waiver would be available only if the new source's emissions would not interfere with timely attainment, see 40 C.F.R. pt. 51, app. S, § VI, making additional NSR requirements unnecessary.\n",
      "Although EPA had authority to provide waivers on a case-by-case basis where a waiver would not interfere with timely attainment, I concur in holding that EPA's elimination of the 18-month limitation violates the anti-backsliding provision in CAA § 172(e), 42 U.S.C. § 7502(e), see Op. at 1270-71.\n",
      "\n",
      "II.\n",
      "The Clean Data Policy, originally published in 1992 and revised in 1995, excuses state planning requirements relating to RFP, attainment demonstrations, and contingency measures for areas attaining the NAAQS but not yet redesignated as attainment areas. In commenting in 2003 on the proposed codification of this statutory interpretation, environmental groups, including the NRDC, stated that the \"EPA cannot authorize states to simply drop subpart 2 measures when the area is meeting either [the 1-hour or 8-hour] standard.\" Clean Air Task Force, et al., Comments at 48. By arguing that \"[t]he [CAA] allows states to move mandated controls to a maintenance contingency plan, [CAA § 175A, 42 U.S.C. § 7505a], but only after the area has been redesignated to attainment,\" id. (emphasis added), environmental groups put EPA on notice of its view that until an area is designated as being in attainment, a state plan must continue to contain the antecedent requirements, such as contingency measures, applicable in nonattainment areas.\n",
      "Contrary to the court's holding that the NRDC's challenge to the contingency plan aspect of EPA's Clean Data Policy is forfeited, Op. at 1272-73, the rulemaking record *1281 evidences that comments put EPA on notice of that objection. First, these comments raised the objection to the Clean Data Policy with respect to the contingency measures requirement of Subpart 2 \"with reasonable specificity during the period for public comment,\" CAA § 307(d)(7)(B), 42 U.S.C. § 7607(d)(7)(B), and sufficiently put EPA on notice of the objection. Second, the comment did not make a mere \"general [challenge] to EPA's approach,\" Mossville Envt'l Action Now v. EPA, 370 F.3d 1232, 1238 (D.C.Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted) (alteration in original), but instead challenged application of a specific EPA policy  the Clean Data Policy  to a specific set of statutory requirements  those in Subpart 2 of the CAA, CAA § 181 et seq., 42 U.S.C. § 7511 et seq. The comment therefore constituted \"adequate notification of the general substance of the complaint,\" S. Coast Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. v. EPA, 472 F.3d 882, 891 (D.C.Cir.2006), including an objection regarding antecedent contingency measures in particular. Third, that other objections to the Clean Data Policy addressed only the requirements for RFP and attainment demonstrations does not render the broader objection insufficient to preserve for judicial review the objection to elimination of the antecedent contingency measures. Fourth, the comment that the \"EPA's `clean data policy,' 68 Fed.Reg. at 32,835/3, is unlawful with respect to both the 1-hour and 8-hour NAAQS for the reasons set forth ... above [regarding RFP and the attainment demonstration],\" Clean Air Task Force, et al., Comments at 100, shows that the objection was not limited to any particular aspect of the Clean Data Policy. Fifth, EPA's response to the comments addressed contingency measures, among other requirements, further indicating the comments were sufficient to put EPA on notice of the objection. See Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,645/1, 71,646/1; cf. Appalachian Power Co. v. EPA, 135 F.3d 791, 817-18 (D.C.Cir.1998).\n",
      "Nonetheless, although the NRDC's challenge is properly before the court, it fails on the merits. Section 172(c)(9) provides that SIPs in nonattainment areas \"shall provide for implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the [NAAQS] by the attainment date applicable under this part.\" 42 U.S.C. § 7502(c)(9) (emphasis added). The NRDC contends that \"[t]he [Clean Data] [P]olicy waives mandatory pollution control requirements based solely on an area's current air quality, without requiring the area to also show  as mandated by Congress  that it has met all of the [CAA]'s applicable requirements....\" NRDC Br. at 34. However, EPA's view that CAA §§ 172(c)(9) and 182(c)(9), 42 U.S.C. §§ 7502(c)(9), 7511a(c)(9), are written in a manner that ties the antecedent contingency measures to the requirements for RFP and an attainment demonstration, such that all are inapplicable upon attainment, see Phase 2 Rule, 70 Fed.Reg. at 71,645, is consistent with the plain text and to the extent there may be ambiguity, it is a reasonable interpretation. The Clean Data Policy requires that areas have \"three consecutive years of clean air quality monitoring data demonstrating attainment of the ozone standard\" before EPA can determine areas have attained. Memorandum from John S. Seitz, Director, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, EPA, to Various EPA Directors 5 (May 10, 1995). Also, if EPA determines an area covered by the Clean Data Policy has violated the NAAQS prior to formal designation of attainment, the Clean Data Policy no longer applies to that area. See 40 C.F.R. § 51.918.\n",

The EPA further noted its determination did \"not change or affect any discretion EPA may otherwise have under the RFG provisions to modify or remove RFG requirements.\" Id. at 71,686.\n",
      "[16]  The Chamber argues that this reasoning is foreclosed because the EPA itself \"stated that the 8-hour NAAQS is the `relevant' standard.\" Chamber Br. at 18 (quoting Phase 1 Rule, 69 Fed.Reg. at 23,983). The EPA used the term \"relevant,\" however, in explaining why it had decided that \"control obligations an area is required to retain in the approved SIP for an area's 1-hour classification must continue to be implemented under the SIP until the area attains and is redesignated to attainment for the 8-hour NAAQS.\" 69 Fed.Reg. at 23,983; see id. (\"Since the relevant NAAQS is now the 8-hour NAAQS, we believe it is appropriate to require these mandated controls to remain as part of the implemented SIP until an area attains the 8-hour NAAQS and is redesignated to attainment.\"). Thus, the cited language in fact supports retaining the RFG control based on the one-hour standard bump-up until Baton Rouge reaches 8-hour attainment.\n",
      "[17]  The Chamber also objects in particular to the EPA's reliance on CAA section 172(e), the anti-backsliding provision. See Chamber Br. at 23-24; Chamber Reply Br. at 2-3. The Chamber argues section 172(e) applies only when the EPA \"relaxes\" a standard and that, in promulgating the 8-hour standard, the EPA in fact strengthened, rather than relaxed, the standard. The EPA's reliance on section 172(e) in the Phase 1 Rule, however, supported its specific policy against backsliding in converting to the 8-hour standard notwithstanding the 8-hour standard is stricter (not more relaxed) than the one-hour standard. We have already upheld this policy as reasonable. See S. Coast, 472 F.3d at 900.\n",

Additionally, defendants included Lanham Act claims for unfair competition and trademark dilution. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a), (c) (West 1998 & Supp.2003).

      "Before we recount the facts of this case, a brief discussion of the legal context in which the facts arise is helpful. Trademarks \"identify and distinguish\" goods produced by one person \"from those manufactured or sold by others and ... indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127 (West Supp.2003). To the purchasing public, a trademark \"signif[ies] that all goods bearing the trademark\" originated from the same source and \"that all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of quality.\" 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 3.2 (4th ed.2003) [hereinafter McCarthy]. Because of its role in assuring consumers of the origin and quality of the associated goods, a trademark is also \"a prime instrument in advertising and selling the goods.\" Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Thus, a proposed mark cannot acquire trademark protection unless the mark is distinctive, that is, unless it serves the traditional trademark functions of \"distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of others\" and identifying the source of the goods. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052 (West 1997). The antithesis of a distinctive mark is a \"generic\" mark which merely employs \"the common name of a product or service,\" Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 464 (4th Cir.1996), or \"refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species,\" Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). Because a generic mark, by definition, neither signifies the source of goods nor distinguishes the particular product from other products on the market, a generic term cannot be protected as a trademark nor registered as one. See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753; Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464; Larsen v. Terk Techs. Corp., 151 F.3d 140, 148 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that \"`generic marks' are accorded no protection at all....\"). \"The concepts of `generic name' and `trademark' are mutually exclusive\" because a generic term \"can never function as a mark to identify and distinguish the products of only one seller.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:1. From a policy standpoint, of course, if a business were permitted to appropriate a generic word as its trademark, it would be \"difficult for competitors to market their own brands of the same product. Imagine being forbidden to describe a Chevrolet as a `car' or an `automobile' because Ford or Chrysler or Volvo had trademarked these generic words.\" Blau Plumbing, Inc. v. S.O.S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F.2d 604, 609 (7th Cir.1986).\n",

      "8\n",
      "Whether trademark protection extends to a proposed mark is tied to the mark's distinctiveness. See Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464. In determining the distinctiveness of a given mark, courts use a categorical approach, placing the mark in one of four classifications that increase in distinctiveness as follows: generic, descriptive, suggestive, and arbitrary or fanciful. See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984). On the opposite end of the spectrum from the generic category are marks that are fanciful or arbitrary — inherently distinctive marks. Fanciful marks are, for the most part, nonsense \"words expressly coined for serving as a trademark.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (offering \"Clorox®, Kodak®, Polaroid®, and Exxon®\" as examples). Arbitrary marks consist of recognizable words used in connection with products for which \"they do not suggest or describe any quality, ingredient, or characteristic,\" as if the trademark was \"arbitrarily assigned.\" Id. (citing \"Camel® cigarettes\" and \"Apple® computers\" as examples).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "Between the generic and the arbitrary or fanciful categories are descriptive marks and suggestive marks, which are often difficult to distinguish from each other. Descriptive marks \"merely describe a function, use, characteristic, size, or intended purpose of the product.\" Id. (mentioning \"After Tan post-tanning lotion\" and \"5 Minute Glue\"). Descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive; the Lanham Act \"accord[s] protection only if they have acquired a `secondary meaning.'\" Larsen, 151 F.3d at 148; see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052(e)(1) (registration may be refused if the proposed mark, \"when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant[,] is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them\"). Saying that a trademark has acquired \"secondary meaning\" is shorthand for saying that a descriptive mark has become sufficiently distinctive to establish \"a mental association in buyers' minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product.\" 2 McCarthy at § 15:5; see Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753 (\"This acquired distinctiveness\" necessary for a descriptive mark to be protected \"is generally called `secondary meaning.'\"); Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (explaining that \"secondary meaning\" exists when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n",

      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "In contrast to descriptive marks, suggestive marks are inherently distinctive and, like arbitrary or fanciful marks, qualify for registration without any showing of \"secondary meaning.\" See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. A mark is suggestive if it \"connote[s], without describing, some quality, ingredient, or characteristic of the product.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (providing the following examples: \"Coppertone®, Orange Crush®, and Playboy®\"). A helpful rule of thumb is that \"`if the mark imparts information directly, it is descriptive,'\" but \"`[i]f it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods, it is suggestive.'\" Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1528 (quoting Union Carbide Corp. v.

The Zannons also acquired ownership rights to the stylized trademark FREEBIES, which the previous publisher registered in 1978 to use as a logo for the magazine. Apparently, the Zannons abandoned this particular mark for a period of time beginning in June 1985; however, in March 1992, the Zannons filed an application, on behalf of Freebies Publishing, with the PTO for a new certificate of registration for a different rendition of the stylized FREEBIES mark. Although the PTO eventually issued a certificate of registration for the mark, the application process was not without difficulty. The PTO's examining attorney initially refused the application because, among other reasons, \"the proposed mark merely describes the goods ... [t]he mark describes the subject matter of applicant's publication.\" J.A. 145.

RSI refused to do so, believing the word \"freebies\" to be generic in nature, not entitled to trademark protection, and free for public use. Defendants initiated an arbitration proceeding against RSI pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\"UDRP\"), which is incorporated into all domain-name registration agreements pursuant to which a second-level domain name is issued to a member of the public. The UDRP requires the registrant to submit disputes concerning the domain name to an approved dispute resolution provider — in this case the National Arbitration Forum — for the purpose of what is essentially non-binding arbitration. See Dluhos v. Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 372-73 (3d Cir.2003) (\"UDRP proceedings do not fall under the Federal Arbitration Act... [and] judicial review of those decisions is not restricted to a motion to vacate arbitration award under § 10 of the FAA, which applies only to binding proceedings likely to `realistically settle the dispute.'\"). The arbitrator concluded that <freebie.com> was confusingly similar to defendants' registered trademark and that RSI had no trademark rights in the name freebie. Additionally, the arbitrator determined that RSI registered the domain name in bad faith because it used the plural term \"freebies\" as a metatag for its website, which directed an Internet search for \"freebies\" to RSI's site.1 The arbitrator was persuaded that this evidence demonstrated RSI's awareness of defendants' FREEBIES trademark and, therefore, bad faith in acquiring its domain name.

The court rejected the same argument defendants now offer on appeal — that summary judgment was inappropriate because an issue of fact existed by virtue of the PTO's registration of the FREEBIES mark, which is prima facie evidence that the mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection. Defendants also argued unsuccessfully that, even though use of the word \"freebie\" is now widespread, the FREEBIES mark was entitled to protection because the defendants did not use the word in the generic sense.

Summary judgment is to be entered when, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 522.

      "Under the Lanham Act, the issuance of a certificate of registration arms the registrant with \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1057(b) (West 1997). Because the PTO may not register a generic mark, the fact that a mark is registered is strong evidence that the mark satisfies the statutory requirements for the distinctiveness necessary for trademark protection. See 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1052(e), 1057(b); 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3) (West 1997). The certificate of registration supplies \"the registrant [with] ... prima facie evidence that its mark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public ... and that its mark ... at a minimum is descriptive and has obtained secondary meaning.\" America Online, Inc. v. AT & T Corp., 243 F.3d 812, 816 (4th Cir.2001); see U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 524. This is a significant procedural advantage for the registrant. Without a certificate of registration, the owner would be required to establish that the disputed mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection in the first place. See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. The effect of the presumption is to satisfy that burden in the absence of rebutting evidence. See America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; see also Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d 778, 783 (9th Cir.2002) (\"In trademark terms, the registration is not absolute but subject to rebuttal\" and \"discharges the plaintiff's original common law burden of proving validity in an infringement action.\").\n",

See Fed.R.Evid. 301 (\"In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.\"). If sufficient evidence of genericness is produced to rebut the presumption, the presumption is \"neutralize[d]\" and essentially drops from the case, although the evidence giving rise to the presumption remains. America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (\"[A]lthough the presumption of discrimination `drops out of the picture' once the defendant meets its burden of production ... the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's prima facie case....\").\n",

      "In America Online, we considered the question of whether, in a federal trademark infringement action, a district court should afford Chevron-type deference to the PTO's determination that a given mark is registrable (and, by definition, not generic). In rejecting the application of Chevron deference, we explained that the PTO's \"decision to register a mark, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, [is] powerful evidence that the registered mark is suggestive\" and that a district court should \"receiv[e] the certificate of registration ... into evidence and treat [it] as prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark.\" 243 F.3d at 817-18. Although we concluded that \"the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration was in this case sufficient to establish a question of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment,\" id. at 818, we nowhere suggested that registration created a per se issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The panel in America Online carefully noted that the registration was sufficient \"in this case\" to preclude summary judgment, and that, in addition to the certificate of registration, there was \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. Id. at 818 (first emphasis added).2 The latter observation, of course, would be pointless if, as defendants argue, America Online held that a certificate of registration alone settles the matter of summary judgment. At most, America Online suggests that, as a general rule, the introduction of a certificate of registration will create enough of an factual dispute to render summary judgment inappropriate on the basis that the mark is generic.

The district court highlighted the contents of defendants' own <freebies.com> website, which undercut their position that \"freebies\" is not a generic term. See Retail Servs. Inc., 247 F.Supp.2d at 827. For example, the < freebies.com> home page included a banner announcing that the website was \"BRINGING YOU THE BEST FREE AND ALMOST FREE OFFERS SINCE 1977\" and stating that \"Freebies.com is the best place on the web for free and almost free offers that you won't find anywhere else.\" J.A. 1382. The stylized freebies logo at the top of the home page appeared above the same slogan that had been emblazoned on the printed version of Freebies Magazine: \"The Magazine with Something for Nothing.\" J.A. 238; 1382.\n",

      "The actual offers included on <freebies.com> or in Freebies Magazine used the term \"freebies\" in this same sense — items that the reader would ordinarily expect to pay for but could obtain for free with the information provided by the magazine or website. For example, the September-October 1983 edition of Freebies Magazine included a section entitled \"Football Freebies\" which explained how to obtain \"fabulous freebies offered by your own special team.\" J.A. 267. The section was divided into two columns. One column, under the heading TEAM, listed addresses for various National Football League franchises, and the other column, under the heading FREEBIE, listed items that could be obtained for no cost (such as bumper stickers or posters) upon request. Likewise, on the website, typical items might include American flag lapel pins or tie tacks, like those offered on January 9, 2003, which could be obtained by sending the specified postage and handling costs to the address provided by <freebies.comm>. Gail and Eugene Zannon, moreover, both gave deposition testimony confirming that their use of the term \"freebies\" was consistent with the commonly understood meaning of the word, referring to free goods and services, and that their primary business is \"the distribution of [information about] free or almost free goods and services.\" J.A. 447; 537.\n",

If it's freebies you want, then it's freebies you got.... so put away your wallet and grab some Freebies!\" J.A. 1258; and < freebiedirectory.com>, the domain name for a website describing itself as \"Your searchable source for FREEBIES\" and providing information about a wide variety of free products and services.

      "Defendants' website, and those listed above, are but a few of the 1,600-plus websites (or more) that incorporate the word \"freebie\" or \"freebies\" into their domain names. These websites are now so common that the term \"freebie site\" is often used by these sites to refer to other sites that, like defendants, offer information about free products or services.3 In addition to this voluminous information pulled directly from these websites, the record contains declarations from competitor sites. Glenda McGarity, the owner of a website called \"Killer Freebies & Deals,\" <killerfreebies.com>, understands \"the word `freebies' to refer to free or almost free goods and services,\" supplies \"information about freebies offered by other individuals or companies,\" and is aware of many such Internet businesses that offer freebies. J.A. 626. Likewise, Lee Seats, who operates About.com's section on the topic of freebies, <freebies.about.com>, uses \"freebies\" on his website \"to refer to free or almost free goods and services\" and is \"in the business of providing information, tips and advice about how to obtain free or almost free goods and services (i.e., freebies) offered by other companies or individuals.\" J.A. 629.

      "1. Additional Evidence that \"Freebies\" Is Not Generic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "Defendants contend that the district court failed to take into consideration any of their evidence, in addition to the certificate of registration, that created an issue of fact by demonstrating the distinctive, non-generic nature of the mark. First, defendants point out that in reviewing defendants' application for trademark registration, the PTO's examining attorney considered one of the same dictionary definitions of \"freebie\" that the district court found persuasive on the issue of genericness. Defendants argue the fact that the PTO ultimately issued the certificate of registration seriously undercuts the value of the dictionary definition. This is not additional evidence; it is part and parcel of the certificate of registration which, as we explained at length, is itself evidence the word or phrase in question is not generic. We fail to see how this part of the registration process offers anything that the whole does not. The district court, of course, took the registration into account and acknowledged its presumptive effect, but simply concluded it was not enough to prevent summary judgment for RSI. See Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 826.4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "Defendants also contend that the district court all but ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the registered term was not only not generic, but was a strong, commercially successful mark with a well-established secondary meaning. In particular, defendants high-light that <freebies.com> receives an average of \"100,000 visits per month from consumers around the world,\" J.A. 712; that Freebies Magazine in print form had millions of paying subscribers; and that defendants sold more than 385,000 books offering information similar to that provided in Freebies Magazine. Evidence of an acquired secondary meaning, however, has no relevance unless the mark in question has been found not to be generic. See, e.g., Home Builders Ass'n of Greater St. Louis v. L & L Exhibition Mgmt., Inc., 226 F.3d 944, 949 (8th Cir.2000) (\"A `generic' mark is the common name of a product or service.... It may not be registered nor used exclusively by one competitor, even if it has acquired secondary meaning.\"); A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198, 222 (3rd Cir.2000) (same).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "For these same reasons, we also discount defendants' reliance on the evidence of actual and potential confusion — according to defendants, for example, there were several hundred complaints from consumers who were seeking defendants' website but ended up in RSI's site, or vice-versa. Evidence establishing a likelihood of confusion simply \"do[es] not bear upon the question of whether [a] trademark ... [is] generic.\" Ale House Mgmt., Inc. v. Raleigh Ale House, Inc., 205 F.3d 137, 144-45 (4th Cir.2000). In sum, defendant has failed to highlight any significant evidence, outside of the certificate of trademark registration, that would create a genuine issue of fact on genericness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41\n",
      "2. Non-Generic Use of \"Freebies\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42\n",
      "Defendants contend that, even if the word \"freebies\" is generic, they were not using this term generically in connection with their business, which defendants carefully describe as the provision of \"information about no-cost or low cost promotional offers.\" J.A. 412. Defendants emphasize that they do not actually distribute or offer the free products or samples, which they concede would constitute a generic use of \"freebies,\" but simply tell consumers how to obtain such items from others, which they claim does not. In essence, defendants argue that this distinction transforms their use of FREEBIES from generic to descriptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "In our view, this razor-thin distinction is not significant. Of course, it is certainly possible for a term to serve as a generic description for one category of products but function as a distinctive mark for unrelated products in a different context. See, e.g., In re Seats, Inc., 757 F.2d 274, 277 (Fed.Cir.1985) (holding that the word \"SEATS\" was not generic for ticket reservations services even though it could not be registered in connection with chairs or couches). Even though defendants do not directly distribute free products or \"freebies,\" their business nonetheless revolves around \"freebies\" in the generic sense of the word. As defendants' website proclaims, they are \"BRINGING YOU THE BEST FREE AND ALMOST FREE OFFERS SINCE 1977!\"5 J.A. 1382. Accordingly, we reject defendants' contention that they were not using the term in its generic sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Incontestable Status of FREEBIES\n",
      "\n",
      "44\n",
      "Defendants suggest that, even if we do not agree that FREEBIES is, at the very least, a descriptive mark that has acquired secondary meaning, it is beyond dispute that FREEBIES has become incontestable, and therefore is not subject to challenge with regard to its secondary meaning. This argument misses the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45\n",
      "If a registered trademark becomes incontestable, the rebuttable presumption that a registered mark has acquired secondary meaning becomes \"conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark\" subject to a number of affirmative defenses enumerated in the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C.A § 1115(b) (West 1998 & Supp.2003). This list, however, does not include a defense based upon a mark's lack of secondary meaning — a merely descriptive mark, then, is subject to challenge based on its lack of distinctiveness until it acquires incontestable status. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. Thus, a presumption arises from the registration of a trademark that the mark is entitled to trademark protection because of either the mark's inherently distinctive nature or its secondary meaning, but the mark is subject to challenge on the basis that it is merely descriptive. See id.; America Online, 243 F.3d at 817-18. The validity of the same registered mark, after qualifying for incontestable status, is conclusively presumed and may not be challenged as merely descriptive. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. The Supreme Court provided this concise summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "A mark that is merely descriptive of an applicant's goods or services is not registrable unless the mark has secondary meaning. Before a mark achieves incontestable status, registration provides prima facie evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark in commerce. The Lanham Act expressly provides that before a mark becomes incontestable an opposing party may prove any ... defense which might have been asserted if the mark had not been registered ... [including a] challenge [to the] mark as merely descriptive.... With respect to incontestable marks, ... registration is conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark.... Mere descriptiveness is not recognized by [the relevant provisions of the Lanham Act] as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark.\n",

      "Id. (internal citations omitted).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "Here, however, the issue is not whether the mark is merely descriptive, but whether it is generic. And incontestability is never a shield for a mark that is generic. Although § 1115(b) does not enumerate the generic nature of a trademark as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark, a registration is subject to cancellation at any time \"if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services ... for which it is registered.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3). As we observed before, a generic word can never function as a trademark or receive a certificate of registration as one. Even an incontestable mark, therefore, comes within the reach of § 1064(3) and may be canceled if it becomes generic. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 658.\n",

      "4. Stylized Lettering in the FREEBIES Trademark\n",
      "\n",
      "49\n",
      "Finally, defendants contend that, separate and apart from their rights in the word FREEBIES, the stylized rendering of the letters is sufficiently distinctive to merit registration. Assuming the registered display of FREEBIES is distinctive (which is far from clear), that fact does not aid defendants — \"such a registration does not give any exclusive right to use the generic word per se\" — \"[t]he only exclusive right from such a `picture' registration is the use of that exact `picture' which happens to spell out a generic name.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:40 (citing Time, Inc. v. Petersen Pub. Co., 173 F.3d 113 (2nd Cir.1999)). We have no difficulty concluding that the modest stylized lettering of the FREEBIES mark in no way affords defendants ownership rights in the generic word \"freebies.\" And, defendants do not guide us to anything in the record to suggest that the stylized rendition of the word is \"so distinctive as to create a commercial impression separate and apart from the [generic] term.\" In re Northland Aluminum Prods., Inc., 777 F.2d 1556, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court properly rejected this argument.\n",

      "Under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), the owner of a protected mark has a cause of action \"against anyone who registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to [the owner's] trademark with the bad faith intent to profit from the good will associated with the trademark.\" Hawes v. Network Solutions, Inc., 337 F.3d 377, 383 (4th Cir.2003); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1). The district court concluded that because it \"found defendants' trademark ineligible for protection, there can be no ACPA violation.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 827. Nevertheless, the court also analyzed whether RSI had violated the ACPA as if the FREEBIES mark were not generic, concluding that \"there was insufficient evidence... in this record to sustain a finding that [RSI] registered the domain name in bad faith.\" Id. at 828. We need go no farther than the district court's initial conclusion that defendants cannot state a claim under the ACPA without a valid trademark. This conclusion is compelled from the statutory language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "51\n",
      "In pertinent part, the ACPA provides that \"[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark,... if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person ... (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark ... and (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that ... is identical or confusingly similar to that mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Under the statute, the term \"mark\" includes \"trademark,\" which is defined as \"identify[ing] and distinguish[ing] [the owner's] goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127. As we noted before, a generic term cannot function as a trademark; in fact, to say \"generic mark\" is to utter an oxymoron. \"By definition, something that is generic cannot serve as a trademark because it cannot function as an indication of source.\" Sunrise Jewelry Mfg. Corp. v. Fred S.A., 175 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1999). Thus, a prerequisite for bringing a claim under the ACPA is establishing the existence of a valid trademark and ownership of that mark. As we have already determined that \"freebies\" is generic and not entitled to trademark protection, defendants cannot surmount this threshold barrier. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment against defendants on their cybersquatting counterclaim, and its declaration that RSI's \"use of the domain name www.freebie.com does not violate the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.\n",

      "RSI cross-appeals the district court's sua sponte dismissal of its request for costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. RSI asserted this claim in its complaint for declaratory relief; it has not yet filed a separate motion for fees and did not seek a ruling on costs and fees as part of its summary judgment motion. Nevertheless, the district court disposed of this question sua sponte, without the benefit of briefing or oral argument. The court held that the case did not satisfy the \"exceptional\" requirement for an award of fees, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a), and that an award of costs was inappropriate as well because \"no violation of a registered trademark has been established.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.

The statute does not define what qualifies as an \"exceptional case.\" Like many, if not most, of our sister circuits, we define the \"exceptional case\" as one in which \"the defendant's conduct was malicious, fraudulent, willful or deliberate in nature.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 370 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Horphag Research, Ltd. v. Pellegrini, 337 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir.2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1111, 124 S.Ct. 1090, 157 L.Ed.2d 900 (2004); Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., 294 F.3d 227, 229 (1st Cir.2002); Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc., 261 F.3d 1188, 1205 (11th Cir.2001); United Phosphorus Ltd. v.

We depart from a number of other courts, however, once the analysis moves beyond the general definition of an \"exceptional case.\" This circuit imposes a dual standard of proof upon prevailing plaintiffs and defendants. A prevailing plaintiff seeking attorney fees must demonstrate \"that the defendant acted in bad faith.\" Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 958 F.2d 594, 599 (4th Cir.1992); PETA, 263 F.3d at 370.6 However, when an alleged infringer is the prevailing party, he can qualify for an award of attorney fees upon a showing of \"something less than bad faith\" by the plaintiff. Scotch Whisky, 958 F.2d at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que Restaurant, 771 F.2d 521, 526 (1985).7 Some pertinent considerations for judging a plaintiff's (or counterclaim plaintiff's) conduct when the defendant prevails include \"economic coercion, groundless arguments, and failure to cite controlling law.\" Ale House Mgmt., 205 F.3d at 144 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).

      "The district court cited two factors in support of its conclusion that RSI, having won on the trademark counterclaims, could not satisfy the lesser showing required of a prevailing defendant: (1) the favor-able arbitration decision by the UDRP panelist, tending to show defendants' good faith in filing its counterclaims; and (2) the certificate of registration, also tending to support a good faith belief in the propriety of the counterclaims.

      "The question, however, is not whether snippets of the record or isolated arguments clearly lack merit.

We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that this is not an \"exceptional case\" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a). Moreover, we see nothing in the district court's order to indicate that it ignored the objective aspect of the positions taken by defendants during this case. Furthermore, although it may have been preferable for the district court to solicit input from the parties at a separate hearing on this issue, RSI could have sought to alter or amend the judgment on the question of attorney fees under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which also may have resulted in a more detailed analysis from the district court. RSI chose not to do so, an understandable tactical choice in light of the fact it had just achieved an unqualified victory on the merits. In this case, we will not disturb the district court's decision, which is also the correct one, solely because it was entered sua sponte when RSI opted not to seize its opportunity to raise its concerns below via Rule 59(e).

      "Appellee was convicted of first-degree murder following a trial in which one Shaw testified, over objection, concerning a statement Williams (an alleged accomplice) had made in the prison where both were incarcerated, after Williams' return there from his arraignment, that had it not been for appellee 'we wouldn't be in this now.' There were 19 other prosecution witnesses, one of whom (another alleged accomplice) gave detailed eyewitness testimony of the crime and the participation of the appellee and Williams therein. Shaw's testimony was admitted under a Georgia statute which, as construed by the Georgia Supreme Court, Evans v. State, 222 Ga. 392, 150 S.E.2d 240, allows into evidence a coconspirator's out-of-court statement made during the concealment phase of the conspiracy. Following affirmance of the conviction by the Georgia Supreme Court, appellee brought this habeas corpus proceeding in federal court. The District Court denied the writ but the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Georgia statute violated appellee's right to confrontation secured by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Appellee contends that the Georgia hearsay exception is unconstitutional since it differs from the hearsay exception applicable to conspiracy trials in the federal courts, which applies only if the out-of-court statement of a coconspirator was made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Held: The judgment is reversed. Pp. 80-90; 93-100.\n",

      "Early on an April morning in 1964, three police officers were brutally murdered in Gwinnett County, Georgia. Their bodies were found a few hours later, handcuffed together in a pine thicket, each with multiple gunshot wounds in the back of the head. After many months of investigation, Georgia authorities charged the appellee, Evans, and two other men, Wade Truett and Venson Williams, with the officers' murders. Evans and Williams were indicted by a grand jury; Truett was granted immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony.\n",

      "Evans pleaded not guilty and exercised his right under Georgia law to be tried separately. After a jury trial, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death.1 The judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia,2 and this Court denied certiorari.3 Evans then brought the present habeas corpus proceeding in a federal district court, alleging, among other things, that he had been denied the constitutional right of confrontation at his trial. The District Court denied the writ,4 but the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that Georgia had, indeed, denied Evans the right, guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments, 'to be confronted by the witnesses against him.'5 From that judgment an appeal was brought to this Court, and we noted probable jurisdiction.6 The case was originally argued last Term, but was set for reargument. 397 U.S. 1060, 90 S.Ct. 1494, 25 L.Ed.2d 682.\n",

      "In order to understand the context of the constitutional question before us, a brief review of the proceedings at Evans' trial is necessary. The principal prosecution witness at the trial was Truett, the alleged accomplice who has been granted immunity. Truett described at length and in detail the circumstances surrounding the murder of the police officers. He testified that he, along with Evans and Williams, had been engaged in switching the license plates on a stolen car parked on a back road in Gwinnett County when they were accosted by the three police officers. As the youngest of the officers leaned in front of Evans to inspect the ignition switch on the car, Evans grabbed the officer's gun from its holster. Evans and Williams then disarmed the other officers at gunpoint, and handcuffed the three of them together. They then took the officers into the woods and killed them by firing several bullets into their bodies at extremely close range. In addition to Truett, 19 other witnesses testified for the prosecution.7 Defense counsel was given full opportunity to cross-examine each witness, and he exercised that opportunity with respect to most of them.\n",

      "One of the 20 prosecution witnesses was a man named Shaw. He testified that he and Williams had been fellow prisoners in the federal penitentiary in Atlanta, Georgia, at the time Williams was brought to Gwinnett County to be arraigned on the charges of murdering the police officers. Shaw said that when Williams was returned to the penitentiary from the arraignment, he had asked Williams: 'How did you make out in court?' and that Williams had responded, 'If it hadn't been for that dirty son-of-a-bitch Alex Evans, we wouldn't be in this now.' Defense counsel objected to the introduction of this testimony upon the ground that it was hearsay and thus violative of Evans' right of confrontation. After the objection was overruled, counsel cross-examined Shaw at length.\n",

      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "The testimony of Shaw relating what he said Williams had told him was admitted by the Georgia trial court, and its admission upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court, upon the basis of a Georgia statute that provides: 'After the fact of conspiracy shall be proved, the declarations by any one of the conspirators during the pendency of the criminal project shall be admissible against all.'8 As the appellate court put it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "\"The rule is that so long as the conspiracy to conceal the  fact that a crime has been committed or the identity of the  perpetrators of the offense continues the parties to such  conspiracy are to be considered so much a unit that the  declarations of either are admissible against the other.' The  defendant, and his co-conspirator, Williams, at the time this  statement was made, were still concealing their identity,  keeping secret the fact that they had killed the deceased, if  they had, and denying their guilt. There was evidence  sufficient to establish a prima facie case of conspiracy to  steal the automobile and the killing of the deceased by the  conspirators while carrying out the conspiracy, and the  statement by Williams made after the actual commission of the  crime, but while the conspiracy continued was admissible.'9  (Citations omitted.)\n",

      "It was the admission of this testimony of the witness Shaw that formed the basis for the appellee's claim in the present habeas corpus proceeding that he had been denied the constitutional right of confrontation in the Georgia trial court. In upholding that claim, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit regarded its duty to be 'not only to interpret the framers' original concept in light of historical developments, but also to translate into due-process terms the constitutional boundaries of the hearsay rule.'10 (Footnotes omitted.) The court upheld the appellee's constitutional claim because it could find no 'salient and cogent reasons' for the exception to the hearsay rule Georgia applied in the present case, an exception that the court pointed out was broader than that applicable to conspiracy trials in the federal courts.11\n",

      "The question before us, then, is whether in the circumstances of this case the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that Evans' murder conviction had to be set aside because of the admission of Shaw's testimony.

      "The argument seems to be, rather, that in any given case the Constitution requires a reappraisal of every exception to the hearsay rule, no matter how long established, in order to determine whether, in the words of the Court of Appeals, it is supported by 'salient and cogent reasons.' The logic of that position would seem to require a constitutional reassessment of every established hearsay exception, federal or state, but in the present case it is argued only that the hearsay exception applied by Georgia is constitutionally invalid because it does not identically conform to the hearsay exception applicable to conspiracy trials in the federal courts. Appellee does not challenge and we do not question the validity of the coconspirator exception applied in the federal courts.\n",
      "\n",

      "That the two evidentiary rules are not identical must be readily conceded. It is settled that in federal conspiracy trials the hearsay exception that allows evidence of an out-of-court statement of one conspirator to be admitted against his fellow conspirators applies only if the statement was made in the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy, and not during a subsequent period when the conspirators were engaged in nothing more than concealment of the criminal enterprise. Lutwak v. United States, 344 U.S. 604, 73 S.Ct. 481, 97 L.Ed. 593; Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440, 69 S.Ct. 716, 93 L.Ed. 790.

      "But it does not follow that because the federal courts have declined to extend the hearsay exception to include out-of-court statements made during the concealment phase of a conspiracy, such an extension automatically violates the Confrontation Clause.

The issue before us is the considerably narrower one  of whether a defendant's constitutional right 'to be  confronted with the witnesses against him' is necessarily  inconsistent with a State's decision to change its hearsay  rules * * *. While it may readily be conceded that hearsay  rules and the Confrontation Clause are generally designed to  protect similar values, it is quite a different thing to  suggest that the overlap is complete and that the  Confrontation Clause is nothing more or less than a  codification of the rules of hearsay and their exceptions as  they existed historically at common law. Our decisions have  never established such a congruence; indeed, we have more than once found a  violation of confrontation values even though the statements  in issue were admitted under an arguably recognized hearsay  exception. The converse is equally true: merely because  evidence is admitted in violation of a long-established  hearsay rule does not lead to the automatic conclusion that  confrontation rights have been denied.'

      "These observations have particular force in the present case. For this Court has never indicated that the limited contours of the hearsay exception in federal conspiracy trials are required by the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause. To the contrary, the limits of this hearsay exception have simply been defined by the Court in the exercise of its rule-making power in the area of the federal law of evidence.13 It is clear that the limited scope of the hearsay exception in federal conspiracy trials is a product, not of the Sixth Amendment, but of the Court's 'disfavor' of 'attempts to broaden the already pervasive and wide-sweeping nets of conspiracy prosecutions.' Grunewald v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 404, 77 S.Ct. 963, 974, 1 L.Ed.2d 931. As Grunewald, Krulewitch, and other cases in this Court make clear, the evidentiary rule is intertwined, not only with the federal substantive law of conspiracy, but also with such related issues as the impact of the statute of limitations upon conspiracy prosecutions.\n",

      "In the Pointer case it appeared that a man named Phillips had been the victim of a robbery in Texas. At a preliminary hearing, Phillips 'as chief witness for the State gave his version of the alleged robbery in detail, identifying petitioner as the man who had robbed him at gunpoint.' 380 U.S., at 401, 85 S.Ct., at 1066. Pointer had no lawyer at this hearing and did not try to cross-examine Phillips. At Pointer's subsequent trial the prosecution was permitted to introduce the transcript of Phillips' testimony given at the preliminary hearing. Thus, as this Court held, the State's 'use of the transcript of that statement at the trial denied petitioner any opportunity to have the benefit of counsel's cross-examination of the principal witness against him.' 380 U.S., at 403, 85 S.Ct., at 1067. The Douglas case, decided the same day as Pointer, involved an even more flagrant violation of the defendant's right of confrontation. For at Douglas' trial the prosecutor himself was permitted to read an 'entire document' purporting to be an accomplice's written confession after the accomplice had refused to testify in reliance upon his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. 'The statements from the document as read by the Solicitor recited in considerable detail the circumstances leading to and surrounding the alleged crime; of crucial importance, they named the petitioner as the person who fired the shotgun blast which wounded the victim.' 380 U.S., at 417, 85 S.Ct., at 1076. In reversing Douglas' conviction, this Court pointed out that the accomplice's reliance upon the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination 'created a situation in which the jury might improperly infer both that the statement had been made and that it was true.' 380 U.S., at 419, 85 S.Ct., at 1077. Yet, since the prosecutor was 'not a witness, the inference from his reading that (the accomplice) made the statement could not be tested by cross-examination. Similarly, (the accomplice) could not be cross-examined on a statement imputed to but not admitted by him.' Ibid.\n",

      "Brookhart v. Janis and Barber v. Page are even further afield. In Brookhart it appeared that the petitioner had been 'denied the right to cross-examine at all any witnesses who testified against him,' and that, additionally, 'there was introduced as evidence against him an alleged confession, made out of court by one of his co-defendants * * * who did not testify in court.' 384 U.S., at 4, 86 S.Ct., at 1247. The only issue in the case was one of waiver, since the State properly conceded that such a wholesale and complete 'denial of cross-examination without waiver * * * would be constitutional error of the first magniture * * *.' 384 U.S., at 3, 86 S.Ct., at 1246. In Barber the 'principal evidence' against the petitioner was a transcript of preliminary hearing testimony admitted by the trial judge under an exception to the hearsay rule that, by its terms, was applicable only if the witness was 'unavailable.' This hearsay exception 'has been explained as arising from necessity * * *.' 390 U.S., at 722, 88 S.Ct., at 1320, and we decided only that Oklahoma could not invoke that concept to use the preliminary hearing transcript in that case without showing 'a good-faith effort' to obtain the witness' presence at the trial.

      "In Roberts v. Russell we held that the doctrine of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476, was applicable to the States and was to be given retroactive effect. But Bruton was a case far different from the one now before us. In that case there was a joint trial of the petitioner and a co-defendant, coincidentally named Evans, upon a charge of armed postal robbery. A postal inspector testified that Evans had confessed to him that Evans and the petitioner had committed the robbery. This evidence was, concedeedly, wholly inadmissible against the petitioner. Evans did not testify. Although the trial judge instructed the jury to disregard the evidence of Evans' confession in considering the question of the petitioner's guilt, we reversed the petitioner's conviction. The primary focus of the Court's opinion in Bruton was upon the issue of whether the jury in the circumstances presented could reasonably be expected to have followed the trial judge's instructions. The Court found that '(t)he risk of prejudice in petitioner's case was even more serious than in Douglas,' because 'the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.' 391 U.S., at 127, 135—136, 88 S.Ct., at 1628. Accordingly, we held that 'in the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner's constitutional right of cross-examination.' 391 U.S., at 137, 88 S.Ct., at 1628. There was not before us in Bruton 'any recognized exception to the hearsay rule,' and the Court was careful to emphasize that 'we intimate no view whatever that such exceptions necessarily raise questions under the Confrontation Clause.' 391 U.S., at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct., at 1624.\n",

The most important witness, by far, was the eyewitness who described all the details of the triple murder and who was cross-examined at great length. Of the 19 other witnesses, the testimony of but a single one is at issue here. That one witness testified to a brief conversation about Evans he had had with a fellow prisoner in the Atlanta Penitentiary. The witness was vigorously and effectively cross-examined by defense counsel.18 His testimony, which was of peripheral signficance at most, was admitted in evidence under a co-conspirator exception to the hearsay rule long established under state statutory law. The Georgia statute can obviously have many applications consistent with the Confrontation Clause, and we conclude that its application in the circumstances of this case did not violate the Constitution.\n",

      "Evans was not deprived of any right of confrontation on the issue of whether Williams actually made the statement related by Shaw. Neither a hearsay nor a confrontation question would arise had Shaw's testimony been used to prove merely that the statement had been made. The hearsay rule does not prevent a witness from testifying as to what he has heard; it is rather a restriction on the proof of fact through extrajudicial statements. From the viewpoint of the Confrontation Clause, a witness under oath, subject to cross-examination, and whose demeanor can be observed by the trier of fact, is a reliable informant not only as to what he has seen but also as to what he has heard.19\n",

      "The confrontation issue arises because the jury was being invited to infer that Williams had implicitly identified Evans as the perpetrator of the murder when he blamed Evans for his predicament. But we conclude that there was no denial of the right of confrontation as to this question of identity. First, the statement contained no express assertion about past fact, and consequently it carried on its face a warning to the jury against giving the statement undue weight. Second, Williams' personal knowledge of the identity and role of the other participants in the triple murder is abundantly established by Truett's testimony and by Williams' prior conviction. It is inconceivable that cross-examination could have shown that Williams was not in a position to know whether or not Evans was involved in the murder. Third, the possibility that Williams' statement was founded on faulty recollection is remote in the extreme. Fourth, the circumstances under which Williams made the statement were such as to give reason to suppose that Williams did not misrepresent Evans' involvement in the crime. These circumstances go beyond a showing that Williams had no apparent reason to lie to Shaw. His statement was spontaneous, and it was against his penal interest to make it. These are indicia of reliability which have been widely viewed as determinative of whether a statement may be placed before the jury though there is no confrontation of the declarant.\n",

Further consideration in the light of facts squarely presenting the issue, as Green did not, has led me to conclude that this is not a happy intent to be attributed to the Framers absent compelling linguistic or historical evidence pointing in that direction.

      "A rule requiring production of available witnesses would significantly curtail development of the law of evidence to eliminate the necessity for production of declarants where production would be unduly inconvenient and of small utility to a defendant. Examples which come to mind are the Business Records Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1732—1733, and the exceptions to the hearsay rule for official statements, learned treatises, and trade reports. See, e.g., Uniform Rules of Evidence 63(15), 63(30), 63(31); Gilstrap v. United States, 389 F.2d 6 (CA5 1968) (business records); Kay v. United States, 255 F.2d 476 (CA4 1958) (laboratory analysis). If the hearsay exception involved in a given case is such as to commend itself to reasonable men, production of the declarant is likely to be difficult, unavailing, or pointless. In unusual cases, of which the case at hand may be an example, the Sixth Amendment guarantees federal defendants the right of compulsory process to obtain the presence of witnesses, and in Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967), this Court held that the Fourteenth Amendment extends the same protection to state defendants.3\n",

While this was characterized as an exception to the clause, rather than a problem to which the clause did not speak, the result would seem correct. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966), and Smith v.

Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), is perhaps most easily dealt with by viewing it as a case of prosecutorial misconduct. Alternatively, I would be prepared to hold as a matter of due process that a confession of an accomplice resulting from formal police interrogation cannot be introduced as evidence of the guilt of an accused, absent some circumstance indicating authorization or adoption. The exclusion of such evidence dates at least from Tong's Case, Kelying 17, 18—19, 84 Eng.Rep. 1061, 1062 (K.B.1663), and is universally accepted.

The judge instructed the jury that this judgment was prima facie evidence that the goods which Kirby was accused of receiving from the three men were in fact stolen. This Court reversed, holding that since the judgment was the sole evidence of the fact of theft, Kirby had been denied his right of confrontation. In my view this is not a confrontation case at all, but a matter of the substantive law of judgments. Accord, 4 Wigmore, supra, § 1079, at 133. Indeed, the Kirby Court indicated that lack of confrontation was not at the heart of its objection when it said that the record would have been competent evidence of the fact of conviction.

      "Judging the Georgia statute here challenged by the standards of due process, I conclude that it must be sustained. Accomplishment of the main object of a conspiracy will seldom terminate the community of interest of the conspirators. Declarations against that interest evince some likelihood of trustworthiness. The jury, with the guidance of defense counsel, should be alert to the obvious dangers of crediting such testimony. As a practical matter, unless the out-of-court declaration can be proved by hearsay evidence, the facts it reveals are likely to remain hidden from the jury by the declarant's invocation of the privilege against self-incrimination.6 In light of such considerations, a person weighing the necessity for hearsay evidence of the type here involved against the danger that a jury will give it undue credit might reasonably conclude that admission of the evidence would increase the likelihood of just determinations of truth. Appellee has not suggested that Shaw's testimony possessed any peculiar characteristic that would lessen the force of these general considerations and require, as a constitutional matter, that the trial judge exercise residual discretion to exclude the evidence as unduly inflammatory. Exclusion of such statements, as is done in the federal courts, commends itself to me, but I cannot say that it is essential to a fair trial. The Due Process Clause requires no more.\n",

      "Appellee Evans was convicted of first-degree murder after a trial in which a witness named Shaw was allowed to testify, over counsel's strenuous objection, about a statement he claimed was made to him by Williams, an alleged accomplice who had already been convicted in a separate trial.1 According to Shaw, the statement, which implicated both Williams and Evans in the crime, was made in a prison conversation immediately after Williams' arraignment. Williams did not testify nor was he called as a witness. Nevertheless, the Court today concludes that admission of the extrajudicial statement attributed to an alleged partner in crime did not deny Evans the right 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him' guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. In so doing, the majority reaches a result completely inconsistent with recent opinions of this Court, especially Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965), and Bruton v.

Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965), this Court first held that 'the Sixth Amendment's right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is * * * a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.' Id., at 403, 85 S.Ct., at 1067. That decision held constitutionally inadmissible a statement offered against a defendant at a state trial where the statement was originally made at a preliminary hearing under circumstances not affording the defendant an adequate opportunity for cross-examination. Indeed, we have since held that even cross-examination at a prior hearing does not satisfy the confrontation requirement, at least where the witness who made the statement is available to be called at trial. Barder v. Page, 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (1968). 'The right to confrontation is basically a trial right.

      "In Douglas v. Alabama, supra, this Court applied the principles of Pointer to a case strikingly similar to this one. There, as here, the State charged two defendants with a crime and tried them in separate trials. There, as here, the State first prosecuted one defendant (Loyd) and then used a statement by him in the trial of the second defendant (Douglas). Although the State called Loyd as a witness, an appeal from his conviction was pending and he refused to testify on the ground that doing so would violate his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "69\n",
      "Without reaching the question whether the privilege was properly invoked,2 the Court held that the prosecutor's reading of Loyd's statement in a purported attempt to refresh his memory denied Douglas' right to confrontation. 'Loyd could not be cross-examined on a statement imputed to but not admitted by him.' 380 U.S., at 419, 85 S.Ct., at 1077. Of course, Douglas was provided the opportunity to cross-examine the officers who testified regarding Loyd's statement. 'But since their evidence tended to show only that Loyd made the confession, cross-examination of them * * * could not substitute for cross-examination of Loyd to test the truth of the statement itself.'3 Id., at 420, 85 S.Ct., at 1077. Surely, the same reasoning compels the exclusion of Shaw's testimony here. Indeed, the only significant difference between Douglas and this case, insofar as the denial of the opportunity to cross-examine is concerned, is that here the State did not even attempt to call Williams to testify in Evans' trial. He was plainly available to the State, and for all we know he would have willingly testified, at least with regard to his alleged conversation with Shaw.4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "70\n",
      "Finally, we have applied the reasoning of Douglas to hold that 'despite instructions to the jury to disregard the implicating statements in determining the codefendant's guilt or innocence, admission at a joint trial of a defendant's extrajudicial confession implicating a codefendant violated the codefendant's right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.' Roberts v. Russell, 392 U.S. 293, 88 S.Ct. 1921, 20 L.Ed.2d 1100 (1968), giving retroactive effect in both state and federal trials to Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968).

      "Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion for reversal characterizes as 'wholly unreal' the possibility that cross-examination of Williams himself would change the picture presented by Shaw's account. A trial lawyer might well doubt, as an article of the skeptical faith of that profession, such a categorical prophecy about the likely results of careful cross-examination. Indeed, the facts of this case clearly demonstrate the necessity for fuller factual development which the corrective test of cross-examination makes possible. The plurality for reversal pigeonholes the out-of-court statement that was admitted in evidence as a 'spontaneous' utterance, hence to be believed. As the Court of Appeals concluded, however, there is great doubt that Williams even made the statement attributed to him.5 Moreover, there remains the further question what if anything, Williams might have meant by the remark that Shaw recounted. Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion concedes that the remark is ambiguous. Plainly it stands as an accusation of some sort: 'If it hadn't been for * * * Evans,' said Williams, according to Shaw, 'we wouldn't be in this now.' At his trial Evans himself gave unsworn testimony to the effect that the murder prosecution might have arisen from enmities that Evans' own law enforcement activities had stirred up in the locality. Did Williams' accusation relate to Evans as a man with powerful and unscrupulous enemies, or Evans as a murderer? Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion opts for the latter interpretation, for it concludes that Williams' remark was 'against his penal interest' and hence to be believed. But at this great distance from events, no one can be certain. The point is that absent cross-examination of Williams himself, the jury was left with only the unelucidated, apparently damning, and patently damaging accusation as told by Shaw.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "73\n",
      "Thus we have a case with all the unanswered questions that the confrontation of witnesses through cross-examination is meant to aid in answering: What did the declarant say, and what did he mean, and was it the truth? If Williams had testified and been cross-examined, Evans' counsel could have fully explored these and other matters. The jury then could have evaluated the statement in the light of Williams' testimony and demeanor. As it was, however, the State was able to use Shaw to present the damaging evidence and thus to avoid confronting Evans with the person who allegedly gave witness against him. I had thought that this was precisely what the Confrontation Clause as applied to the States in Pointer and our other cases prevented.\n",

For example, such facts as that Williams' alleged statement was not made during official interrogation, was not in transcript form, and was not introduced in a joint trial—though they differentiate some of the cases—are surely irrelevant. Other cases have presented each of these factors,6 and no reason is offered why the right of confrontation could be so limited.\n",

      "75\n",
      "Nor can it be enough that the statement was admitted in evidence 'under a long-established and well-recognized rule of state law.' Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion surely does not mean that a defendant's constitutional right of confrontation must give way to a state evidentiary rule. That much is established by our decision in Barber v. Page, supra, which held unconstitutional the admission of testimony in accordance with a rule similarly well recognized and long established. However, the plurality for reversal neither succeeds in distinguishing that case nor considers generally that there are inevitably conflicts between Pointer and state evidentiary rules. Rather, it attempts to buttress its conclusion merely by announcing a reluctance to equate evidentiary hearsay rules and the Confrontation Clause.7\n",

      "The Court of Appeals, however, was not of the view that the Confrontation Clause implies unrelenting hostility to whatever evidence may be classified as hearsay. Nor did that court hold that States must conform their evidentiary rules to the hearsay exceptions applicable in federal conspiracy trials. While it did note that this case does not in reality even involve the traditional hearsay rule and its so-called coconspirators exception,8 that was not the basis for its decision. Rather, the Court of Appeals found in the admission of an incriminatory and inculpating statement attributed to an alleged accomplice who was not made available for cross-examination what it termed an obvious abridgment of Evans' right of confrontation. Since the State presented no satisfactory justification for the denial of confrontation, cf. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S., at 407, 85 S.Ct., at 1069, the Court of Appeals held that under Douglas v. Alabama and this Court's other cases Evans was denied his constitutional rights.\n",

      "Surely the Constitution requires at least that much when the State denies a defendant the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him in a criminal trial. In any case, that Shaw's testimony was admitted in accordance with an established rule of state law cannot aid my Brethren in reaching their conclusion. Carried to its logical end, justification of a denial of the right of confrontation on that basis would provide for the wholesale avoidance of this Court's decisions in Douglas and Bruton,9 decisions which Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion itself reaffirms. Indeed, if that opinion meant what it says, it would come very close to establishing in reverse the very equation it seeks to avoid—an equation that would give any exception to a state hearsay rule a 'permanent niche in the Constitution' in the form of an exception to the Confrontation Clause as well.\n",

      "Finally, the plurality for reversal apparently distinguishes the present case on the gound that it 'does not involve evidence in any sense 'crucial' or 'devastating.\" Despite the characterization of Shaw's testimony as 'of peripheral significance at most,' however, the possibility of its prejudice to Evans was very real. The outcome of Evans' trial rested, in essence, on whether the jury would believe the testimony of Truett with regard to Evans' role in the murder. Truett spoke as an admitted accomplice who had been immunized from prosecution. Relying on Georgia law, not federal constitutional law, the trial judge instructed the jury that 'you cannot lawfully convict upon the testimony of an accomplice alone. * * * (T)he testimony of an accomplice must be corroborated. * * * (T)he corroboration * * * must be such as to connect the defendant with the criminal act.' The State presented the testimony of a number of other witnesses, in addition to that of the alleged accomplice that tended to corroborate Evans' guilt. But Shaw's account of what Williams supposedly said to him was undoubtedly a part of that corroborating evidence.10\n",

      "79\n",
      "Indeed, Mr. Justice STEWART's opinion does not itself upset the Court of Appeals' finding that the admission of Shaw's testimony, if erroneous, could not be considered harmless. Beyond and apart from the question of harmless error, Mr. Justice STEWART undertakes an inquiry, the purpose of which I do not understand, into whether the evidence admitted is 'crucial' or 'devastating.' The view is, apparently, that to require the exclusion of evidence falling short of that high standard of prejudice would bring a moment of clamor against the Bill of Rights. I would eschew such worries and confine the inquiry to the traditional questions: Was the defendant afforded the right to confront the witnesses against him? And, if not, was the denial of his constitutional right harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?\n",

      "The fact is that Evans may well have been convicted in part by an incriminatory and implicating statement attributed to an alleged accomplice who did not testify and who consequently could not be questioned regarding the truth or meaning of that statement. The Court of Appeals correctly recognized that the Confrontation Clause prohibits such a result, whether the statement is introduced under the guise of refreshing a witness' recollection as in Douglas v. Alabama, against a codefendant with a limiting instruction as in Bruton v. United States, or in accordance with some other evidentiary rule as here.\n",

      "I am troubled by the fact that the plurality for reversal, unable when all is said to place this case beyond the principled reach of our prior decisions, shifts its ground and begins a hunt for whatever 'indicia of reliability' may cling to Williams' remark, as told by Shaw. Whether Williams made a 'spontaneous' statement 'against his penal interest' is the very question that should have been tested by cross-examination of Williams himself. If 'indicia of reliability' are so easy to come by, and prove so much, then it is only reasonable to ask whether the Confrontation Clause has any independent vitality at all in protecting a criminal defendant against the use of extrajudicial statements not subject to cross-examination and not exposed to a jury assessment of the declarant's demeanor at trial.11 I believe the Confrontation Clause has been sunk if any out-of-court statement bearing an indicium of a probative likelihood can come in, no matter how damaging the statement may be or how great the need for the truth-discovering test of cross-examination. Cf. California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149, 161—162, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1936 1937, 26 L.Ed.2d 489 (1970). Our decisions from Pointer and Douglas to Bruton and Roberts require more that this meager inquiry. Nor is the lame 'indicia' approach necessary to avoid a rampaging Confrontation Clause that tramples all flexibility and innovation in a state's law of evidence. That specter is only a specter.12 To decide this case I need not go beyond hitherto settled Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment law to consider generally what effect, if any, the Confrontation Clause has on the common-law hearsay rule and its exceptions, since no issue of such global dimension is presented. Cf. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S., at 128 n. 3, 88 S.Ct., at 1623. The incriminatory extrajudicial statement of an alleged accomplice is so inherently prejudicial that it cannot be introduced unless there is an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant, whether or not his statement falls within a genuine exception to the hearsay rule.\n",

Texas. 380 U.S., at 404, 85 S.Ct., at 1068, and that admission in the absence of cross-examination of certain types of suspect and highly damaging statements is one of the 'threats to a fair trial' against which 'the Confrontation Clause was directed,' Bruton v.

      " Evans was not charged with conspiracy nor could he have been under Georgia law. The 'conspiracy' element came in as part of the State's evidentiary law, part of which goes far beyond the traditional hearsay exception even as it exists with regard to the 'concealment phase' in some jurisdictions. Indeed, Williams' alleged statement itself negates the notion that Evans had authorized Williams to speak or had assumed the risk in order to achieve an unlawful aim through concert of effort. It is difficult to conceive how Williams could be part of a conspiracy to conceal the crime when all the alleged participants were in custody and he himself had already been arraigned. As this Court stated in Fiswick v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 217, 67 S.Ct. 224, 227, 91 L.Ed. 196 (1946), an 'admission by one coconspirator after he has been apprehended is not in any sence a furtherance of the criminal enterprise. It is rather a frustration of it.' One lower court in Georgia has adopted essentially this reasoning in reversing a conviction where testimony similar to that objected to in this case was admitted.

      "1. Tennessee's statutory requirement that a defendant in a criminal proceeding 'desiring to testify shall do so before any other testimony for the defense is heard by the court trying the case' violates the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. A defendant may not be penalized for remaining silent at the close of the State's case by being excluded from the stand later in the trial. Pp. 1892—1895.\n",
      "2. The Tennessee rule also infringes the defendant's constitutional rights by depriving him of the 'guiding hand of counsel,' in deciding not only whether the defendant will testify but, if so, at what stage. P. 1895.\n",

      "Petitioner was tried and convicted in the Circuit Court of Hamilton County, Tennessee, on charges of armed robbery and unlawful possession of a pistol. During the trial, at the close of the State's case, defense counsel moved to delay petitioner's testimony until after other defense witnesses had testified. The trial court denied this motion on the basis of Tenn.Code Ann. § 40—2403 (1955), which requires that a criminal defendant 'desiring to testify shall do so before any other testimony for the defense is heard by the court trying the case.'1 Although the prosecutor agreed to waive the statute, the trial court refused, stating that 'the law is, as you know it to be, that if a defendant testifies he has to testify first.'

      "* The rule that a defendant must testify first is related to the ancient practice of sequestering prospective witnesses in order to prevent their being influenced by other testimony in the case. See 6 J. Wigmore, Evidence § 1837 (3d ed. 1940). Because the criminal defendant is entitled to be present during trial, and thus cannot be sequestered, the requirement that he precede other defense witnesses was developed by court decision and statute as an alternative means of minimizing this influence as to him. According to Professor Wigmore, '(t)he reason for this rule is the occasional readiness of the interested person to adapt his testimony, when offered later, to victory rather than to veracity, so as to meet the necessities as laid open by prior witnesses . . .'

      "Despite this traditional justification, the validity of the requirement has been questioned in a number of jurisdictions as a limitation upon the defendant's freedom to decide whether to take the stand. Two federal courts have rejected the contention, holding that a trial court does not abuse its discretion by requiring the defendant to testify first. United States v. Shipp, 359 F.2d 185, 189—190 (CA6 1966); Spaulding v. United States, 279 F.2d 65, 66—67 (CA9 1960). In Shipp, however, the dissenting judge strongly objected to the rule, stating:\n",

The  decision as to whether the defendant in a criminal case shall  take the stand is, therefore, often of utmost importance, and  counsel must, in many cases, meticulously balance the  advantages and disadvantages of the prisoner's becoming a  witness in his own behalf. Why, then, should a court insist  that the accused must testify before any other evidence is  introduced in his behalf, or be completely foreclosed from  testifying thereafter? . . . This savors of judicial whim,  even though sanctioned by some authorities; and the cause of  justice and a fair trial cannot be subjected to such a  whimsicality of criminal procedure.' 359 F.2d, at 190—191.\n",

He may  intelligently weigh the advantages and disadvantages of his  situation, and, thus advised, determine how to act. Whether  he shall testify or not; if so, at what stage in the progress  of his defense,—are equally submitted to the free and  unrestricted choice of one accused of crime, and are in the  very nature of things beyond the control or direction of the  presiding judge.

      "Although Bell, Nassif, and the Shipp dissent were not based on constitutional grounds, we are persuaded that the rule embodied in § 40—2403 is an impermissible restriction on the defendant's right against self-incrimination, 'to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty . . . for such silence.' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). As these opinions demonstrate, a defendant's choice to take the stand carries with it serious risks of impeachment and cross-examination; it 'may open the door to otherwise inadmissible evidence which is damaging to his case,' McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 213, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1470, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971), including, now, the use of some confessions for impeachment purposes that would be excluded from the State's case in chief because of constitutional defects. Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971). Although 'it is not thought inconsistent with the enlightened administration of criminal justice to require the defendant to weigh such pros and cons in deciding whether to testify,' McGautha v. California, supra, 402 U.S., at 215, 91 S.Ct., at 1471, none would deny that the choice itself may pose serious dangers to the success of an accused's defense.\n",

      "Although a defendant will usually have some idea of the strength of his evidence, he cannot be absolutely certain that his witnesses will testify as expected or that they will be effective on the stand. They may collapse under skillful and persistent cross-examination, and through no fault of their own they may fail to impress the jury as honest and reliable witnesses. In addition, a defendant is sometimes compelled to call a hostile prosecution witness as his own.2 Unless the State provides for discovery depositions of prosecution witnesses, which Tennessee apparently does not,3 the defendant is unlikely to know whether this testimony will prove entirely favorable.\n",

      "Because of these uncertainties, a defendant may not know at the close of the State's case whether his own testimony will be necessary or even helpful to his cause. Rather than risk the dangers of taking the stand, he might prefer to remain silent at that point, putting off his testimony until its value can be realistically assessed. Yet, under the Tennessee rule, he cannot make that choice 'in the unfettered exercise of his own will.' Section 40—2403 exacts a price for his silence by keeping him off the stand entirely unless he chooses to testify first.4 This, we think, casts a heavy burden on a defendant's otherwise unconditional right not to take the stand.5 The rule, in other words, 'cuts down on the privilege (to remain silent) by making its assertion costly.' Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 614, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 1233, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965).6\n",

      "Although the Tennessee statute does reflect a state interest in preventing testimonial influence, we do not regard that interest as sufficient to override the defendant's right to remain silent at trial.7 This is not to imply that there may be no risk of a defendant's coloring his testimony to conform to what has gone before. But our adversary system reposes judgment of the credibility of all witnesses in the jury. Pressuring the defendant to take the stand, by foreclosing later testimony if he refuses, is not a constitutionally permissible means of ensuring his honesty. It fails to take into account the very real and legitimate concerns that might motivate a defendant to exercise his right of silence. And it may compel even a wholly truthful defendant, who might otherwise decline to testify for legitimate reasons, to subject himself to impeachment and cross-examination at a time when the strength of his other evidence is not yet clear. For these reasons we hold that § 40 2403 violates an accused's constitutional right to remain silent insofar as it requires him to testify first for the defense or not at all.\n",

      "For closely related reasons we also regard the Tennessee rule as an infringement on the defendant's right of due process as defined in Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570, 81 S.Ct. 756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783 (1961). There the Court reviewed a Georgia statute providing that a criminal defendant, though not competent to testify under oath, could make an unsworn statement at trial. The statute did not permit defense counsel to aid the accused by eliciting his statement through questions. The Court held that this limitation deprived the accused of \"the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the proceedings against him,' Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69, 53 S.Ct. 55, 64, 77 L.Ed. 158, within the requirement of due process in that regard as imposed upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment.' Id., at 572, 81 S.Ct., at 758. The same may be said of § 40—2403. Whether the defendant is to testify is an important tactical decision as well as a matter of constitutional right. By requiring the accused and his lawyer to make that choice without an opportunity to evaluate the actual worth of their evidence, the statute restricts the defense particularly counsel—in the planning of its case. Furthermore, the penalty for not testifying first is to keep the defendant off the stand entirely, even though as a matter of professional judgment his lawyer might want to call him later in the trial. The accused is thereby deprived of the 'guiding hand of counsel' in the timing of this critical element of his defense. While nothing we say here otherwise curtails in any way the ordinary power of a trial judge to set the order of proof, the accused and his counsel may not be restricted in deciding whether, and when in the course of presenting his defense, the accused should take the stand.\n",

      "Of course, it is more convenient for a lawyer to defer the decision to have the accused take the stand until he knows how his other witnesses fare. By the same token, it is helpful for an accused to be able to adjust his testimony to what his witnesses have had to say on the matter. No one has seriously challenged the absolute discretion of a trial judge to exclude witnesses, other than the accused, from the courtroom until they are called to the stand. The obvious purpose is to get honest testimony and minimize the prospect that a witness will adjust and 'tailor' his version to fit what others have said; it seems somewhat odd to say the Constitution forbids all States to require the accused to give his version before his other witnesses speak, since it is not possible to exclude him from the courtroom, as is the common rule for witnesses who are not parties.\n",

      "The Court's holding under the Fifth Amendment is admittedly unsupported by any authority and cannot withstand analysis. The Constitution provides only that no person shall 'be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.' It is undisputed that petitioner was not in fact compelled to be a witness against himself, as he did not take the stand. Nor was the jury authorized or encouraged to draw perhaps unwarranted inferences from his silence, as in Griffin v. California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965). Petitioner was clearly not subjected to the obvious compulsion of being held in contempt for his silence, as in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), nor did the Tennessee procedure subject him to any other significant compulsion to testify other than the compulsion faced by every defendant who chooses not to take the stand—the knowledge that in the absence of his testimony the force of the State's evidence may lead the jury to convict. Cases such as Spevack v. Klein, 385 U.S. 511, 87 S.Ct. 625, 17 L.Ed.2d 574 (1967), and Gardner v. Broderick, 392 U.S. 273, 88 S.Ct. 1913, 20 L.Ed.2d 1082 (1968), involving loss of employment or disbarment are therefore clearly inapposite. That should end the matter.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "However, the Court distorts both the context and content of Malloy v. Hogan, supra, 378 U.S., at 8, 84 S.Ct., at 1493, by intimating that the Fifth Amendment may be violated if the defendant is forced to make a difficult choice as to whether to take the stand at some point in time prior to the conclusion of a criminal trial. But, as the Court pointed out only last Term in McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971), '(a)lthough a defendant may have a right, even of constitutional dimensions, to follow whichever course he chooses, the Constitution does not by that token always forbid requiring him to choose.' Id., at 213, 91 S.Ct., at 1470. Indeed, the 'choice' we sustained in McGautha was far more difficult than that here, as the procedure there clearly exerted considerable force to compel the defendant to waive the privilege and take the stand in order to avoid the possibile imposition of the death penalty. See also Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970). There is no such pressure here. The majority's rationale would lead to the absurd result that the State could not even require the defendant to finally decide whether he wishes to take the stand prior to the time the jury retires for deliberations, for, even at that point, he 'may not know . . . whether his own testimony will be necessary or even helpful to his cause.' Even then, he might 'prefer to remain silent . . . putting off his testimony until its value can be realistically assessed.' In short, even at the close of the defense case, his decision to take the stand is not unfettered by the difficulty to make the hard choice to waive the privilege. Perhaps the defendant's decision will be easier at the close of all the evidence. Perhaps not. The only 'burden' cast on the defendant's choice to take the stand by the Tennessee procedure is the burden to make the choice at a given point in time. That the choice might in some cases be easier if made later is hardly a matter of constitutional dimension.\n",

      "The Court's holding that the Tennessee rule deprives the defendant of the 'guiding hand of counsel' at every stage of the proceedings fares no better, as Mr. Justice REHNQUIST clearly demonstrates. It amounts to nothing more than the assertion that counsel may not be restricted by ordinary rules of evidence and procedure in presenting an accused's defense if it might be more advantageous to present it in some other way. A rule forbidding defense counsel to ask leading questions of the defendant when he takes the stand may restrict defense counsel in his options and may in many cases bear only remote relationship to the goal of truthful testimony. Yet no one would seriously contend that such a universal rule of procedure is prohibited by the Constitution. The rule that the defendant waives the Fifth Amendment privilege as to any and all relevant matters when he decides to take the stand certainly inhibits the choices and options of counsel, yet this Court has never questioned such a rule and reaffirmed its validity only last Term. See McGautha v. California, 402 U.S., at 215, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1471, 28 L.Ed.2d 711. Countless other rules of evidence and procedure of every State may interfere with the 'guiding hand of counsel.'

Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), establish the fundamental nature of the constitutional right to the assistance of counsel, no case previously decided by this Court elevates defense counsel to the role of impresario with respect to decisions as to the order in which witnesses shall testify at the trial.\n",

State, 165 Neb. 381, 85 N.W.2d 712 (1957). The notion that the Sixth Amendment allows defense counsel to overrule the trial judge as to the order in which witnesses shall be called stands on its head the traditional understanding of the defendant's right to counsel. Defense counsel sits at the side of the accused, not to take over the conduct of the trial, but to advise the accused as to various choices available to him within the limits of existing state practice and procedure.\n",

      "I could understand, though I would not agree with, a holding that under these circumstances the Fourteenth Amendment conferred a right upon the defendant, counseled or not, to decide at what point during the presentation of his case to take the stand. But to cast the constitutional issue in terms of violation of the defendant's right to counsel suggests that defense counsel has an authority of constitutional dimension to determine the order of proof at trial. It is inconceivable to me that the Court would permit every preference of defense counsel as to the order in which defense witnesses were to be called to prevail over a contrary ruling of the trial judge in the exercise of his traditional discretion to control the order of proof at trial. The crucial fact here is not that counsel wishes to have a witness take the stand at a particular time, but that the defendant whether advised by counsel or otherwise—wishes to determine at what point during the presentation of his case he desires to take the stand. Logically the benefit of today's ruling should be available to a defendant conducting his own defense who has waived the right of counsel, but since the Court insists on putting the issue in terms of the advice of counsel, rather than in terms of defense control over the timing of defendant's appearance, the application of today's holding to that situation is by no means clear.\n",

      "The Tennessee statute in question is, as the Court notes in its opinion, based upon an accommodation between the traditional policy of sequestering prospective witnesses before they testify and the right of the criminal defendant to be present during his trial. Since the defendant may not be sequestered against his will while other witnesses are testifying, the State has placed a more limited restriction on the presentation of his testimony. The defendant is required to testify, if he chooses to do so, as the first witness for the defense. The State applies the same rule evenhandedly to the prosecuting witness, if there be one; he, too, must testify first. While it is perfectly true that the prosecution is given no constitutional right to remain silent, this fact does not detract from the evident fairness of Tennessee's effort to accommodate the two conflicting policies.\n",

This fear is not groundless, nor is its importance denigrated by vague generalities such as the statement that 'our adversary system reposes judgment of the credibility of all witnesses in the jury.' Ante, at 611. Assuredly the traditional common-law charge to the jury confides to that body the determination as to the truth or falsity of the testimony of each witness. But the fact that the jury is instructed to make such a determination in reaching its verdict has never been thought to militate against the desirability, to say nothing of the constitutionality, of additional inhibitions against perjury during the course of a trial. The traditional policy of sequestering nonparty witnesses, the requirement of an oath on the part of all witnesses, and the opportunity afforded for cross-examination of witnesses are but examples of such inhibitions. As a matter of constitutional judgment it may be said that the effectuation of this interest has been accomplished by Tennessee at too high a price, but the importance of the interest itself cannot rationally be dispelled by loose assertions about the role of the jury.\n",

After the State had rested, defense counsel requested permission to call the local chief of police as a hostile witness, and to cross-examine him about the circumstances surrounding petitioner's lineup. Because the police chief had not testified, though he was subpoenaed by the State, the trial court denied the motion, ruling that the chief will 'be your witness if you call him.'\n",

State, 139 Tenn. 674, 202 S.W. 935 (1918), holds that a defendant may testify in rebuttal if he has testified first on direct.

Despite its apparent attempt at symmetry, this rule does not restrict the prosecution in the same way as the defense, for the State has a certain latitude in designating its prosecuting witness, choosing for example between the victim of the crime and the investigating officer. A more fundamental distinction, of course, is that the State, through its prosecuting witness, does not share the defendant's constitutional right not to take the stand. Thus, the choice to present the prosecuting witness first or not at all does not raise a constitutional claim secured to the State, as it does in the situation of the defendant.\n",

      "One of the principal questions posed by this appeal is whether the availability of civil proceedings--often used to enforce the securities laws--forecloses the government from instituting criminal prosecution for the violation of these same laws.  The complex contrivances revealed in the present record, such as \"parking\" stock at a brokerage firm in order to create the impression that the stock has been sold, or having a broker \"accululate\" stock on an investor's behalf in order to delay disclosure of the purchase, carry home the meaning of Scott's \"O, what a tangled web we weave, When first we practice to deceive!\"  2 Sir Walter Scott, Marmion, Canto VI, XVII (Little Brown & Co. 1857).  Although these schemes are not specifically dealt with in the securities laws, the Securities Exchange Act nonetheless contains a general antifraud provision and other federal laws prohibit conspiracy, fraud, and making false statements to United States agencies.  This appeal addresses the propriety of enforcing the complained of trading methods through these general fraud and false statement provisions.\n",
      "Appellant Paul A. Bilzerian (hereafter referred to as Bilzerian or defendant) was convicted on nine counts of an indictment charging violations of securities fraud, making false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and conspiracy to commit specific offenses, and to defraud the SEC and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).  The charges relate to transactions defendant made between May 1985 and October 1986 in the common stock of four companies:  Cluett, Peabody and Company, Inc.  (Cluett), Hammermill Paper Company (Hammermill), H.H. Robertson Company (Robertson) and Armco Steel (Armco).  On September 29, 1989, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Ward, J.), entered a judgment of conviction and sentenced Bilzerian to four years in prison and a $1.5 million fine.\n",

      "1. The Cluett Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "1\n",
      "The indictment charged three fraudulent schemes relating to trades in Cluett.  These involved misrepresenting the source of funds used to purchase stock, secretly accumulating stock through nominee, and misrepresenting an \"open market\" purchase.  By agreeing to share any profits and by guaranteeing against any loss, Bilzerian in April and May of 1985 raised $9 million to buy Cluett stock from various individual investors.  The funds were transferred to him through a series of trusts set up for that purpose.  Defendant was required to disclose purchase of this large block of stock on a form filed with the SEC known as a Schedule 13D.  On the 13D, and its amendment, respecting the Cluett purchase, defendant stated that the stock was purchased with \"personal funds,\" and did not disclose that they were raised from other investors with whom he had a profit-sharing and guarantee-against-loss agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "Bilzerian also engaged an employee of Jeffries & Company, Inc.  (Jeffries), a registered broker-dealer, to accumulate stock on his behalf.  Under stock accumulation, a broker-dealer purchases stock in its own account with the understanding that the customer will buy it at a later date at the broker's cost plus interest and commissions.  In such a transaction the prearranged sale involves no risk of loss to the broker-dealer, who acts as a nominee for the true purchaser.  On May 28, 1985 defendant purchased the accumulated stock without revealing the accumulation arrangement to the SEC.  The indictment charged that the agreement was fraudulently designed to delay the reporting requirements of the securities laws.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3\n",
      "Bilzerian also agreed to purchase 347,567 shares of Cluett common stock from a group of shareholders in contemplation of making a tender offer for that company, offering between $38 and $40 per share depending on the price of his tender offer.  This proposed purchase was made with the understanding that the trade would not settle for 45 days and that defendant would cancel the purchase proposal if a third party offered more for the shares.  Although he learned that 66,667 of the shares included in this block were already under his control, defendant advised the shareholder group to proceed with the sale.  The offering statement claimed that 347,567 shares were purchased \"in an open market transaction.\"  The existence and terms of the privately-negotiated transaction were not disclosed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "The indictment alleged that the Cluett transactions violated Secs. 10(b) and 32 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), 15 U.S.C. Secs. 78j(b) and 78ff (Count One), and the federal false statements statute, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (Counts Two, Three, and Four).  Defendant was also charged with conspiring to defraud the SEC and to commit specific offenses in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (Count Eight).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The Hammermill Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "In June 1986 defendant raised $8 million from an individual investor for the purpose of purchasing Hammermill stock.  These funds were made available to him through a trust upon his agreeing to share any profits from the eventual sale of the stock.  Bilzerian turned the funds over to a limited partnership--of which he was the general partner--and the partnership made the tender offer for Hammermill.  The disclosure relating to the stock purchase and tender offer stated that defendant's contribution to the partnership was from \"personal funds.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6\n",
      "Once again, defendant arranged to have an employee of Jeffries accumulate Hammermill stock on his behalf.  On July 21, 1986 he purchased 551,000 accumulated shares of Hammermill.  Although he was required to disclose the acquisition as of July 7, he failed to file until July 25, and at that time did not disclose the accumulation agreement.  The Hammermill transactions were alleged to violate 15 U.S.C. Secs. 78j(b) and 78ff (Count Five), 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 (Counts Six and Seven) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (Count Eight).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Robertson and Armco Transactions\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Defendant also engaged in \"stock parking\" transactions in shares of Robertson and Armco.  \"Parking\" refers to a transaction in which a broker-dealer buys stock from a customer with the understanding that the customer will buy the stock back at a later date for the purchase price plus interest and commissions.  As with \"accumulation\" there is no market risk to the broker-dealer who is the owner of the shares in name only.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Bilzerian arranged to park 58,000 shares of Robertson with Jeffries for 30 days.  Although he assured Jeffries he would repurchase the stock, the stock price fell substantially in the interim and he refused to honor his commitment.  As a result, Jeffries incurred a $250,000 loss.  Defendant compensated Jeffries in part for this loss by generating approximately $125,000 in commissions for the broker.  He paid the remaining $125,000 with the understanding that it would be refunded when an additional $125,000 of commissions was generated.  Jeffries sent Bilzerian a false invoice in the amount of $125,000 for \"financial services\" that were never performed, and the latter deducted the payment on a 1985 tax return.  When additional commissions were generated in 1986 he sent Jeffries fictitious invoices for \"consulting services\" seeking a refund of the $125,000.\n",
      "\n",

      "9\n",
      "Defendant also arranged to park 306,600 shares of Armco with Jeffries for a 30-day period beginning September 2, 1986.  In addition, Jeffries agreed to accumulate Armco stock in its own account on defendant's behalf and then sell him the accumulated stock when he repurchased the 306,600 shares.  On October 2 defendant purchased 818,900 shares of Armco from Jeffries at the prevailing market price of $8 per share.  Although the broker realized a $575,000 gain on the sale, the profits belonged to defendant by virtue of the stock parking and accumulation agreements.  Defendant sent his broker an invoice for fictitious \"consulting services\" in order to account for the profits he realized on the trade.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "For his part in the Robertson and Armco trades, Bilzerian was charged with conspiring to defraud the SEC and the IRS and to commit specific offenses including violations of 15 U.S.C. Secs. 78g, 78q, and 78ff (1988) and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001, in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (Count Nine).\n",

      "B. The Trial\n",
      "\n",
      "11\n",
      "At trial defendant argued that he did not intend to violate the securities laws, but believed the financing structure of the transactions, utilizing trusts to borrow funds, would allow him legally to avoid disclosure regarding other investors, and that describing the source of his funds as \"personal\" was lawful.  A motion was made in limine seeking a ruling permitting him to testify regarding his belief in the lawfulness of describing the source of his funds as \"personal\" without being subjected to cross-examination on communications he had with his attorney on this subject, discussions ordinarily protected by the attorney-client privilege.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "Declining to rule on the issue in the abstract, Judge Ward stated that if defendant testified regarding his good faith regarding the legality of the disclosure, it would open the door to cross-examination with respect to the basis for his belief, and that such cross-examination would allow inquiry into communications with his attorney.  Thus, defendant did not testify regarding his good faith, and now claims the trial court's ruling prejudiced his defense and infringed his constitutional right to deny each element of the charge against him.  Error is also claimed in several evidentiary rulings made at trial, including the district court's decision to admit expert testimony by a government witness on the legal requirements of the federal securities laws, while excluding similar expert testimony offered by the defense.  Additionally, defendant challenges the admission into evidence of a $4 million tax return error on an unrelated personal tax return.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "Beyond the challenge that his right to a fair trial was prejudiced, Bilzerian asserts fundamental errors in the prosecution of this case.  Specifically, he contends that prosecution under the general false statements statute was improper in light of the existence of more specific securities laws covering the same conduct, that any misstatements or omissions made on securities filings were immaterial, and that he was improperly charged under the \"defraud\" clause of the federal conspiracy statute rather than the more specific \"offense\" clause.\n",

      "A. Attorney-Client Privilege\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "Defendant contends the testimony he sought to introduce regarding his good faith attempt to comply with the securities laws would not have disclosed the content or even the existence of any privileged communications or asserted a reliance on counsel defense.  As such, he continues, the attorney-client privilege would not be waived by his testimony and, therefore, the trial court committed reversible error when it denied his motion in limine seeking to protect the privilege.  He alleges that this ruling, together with similar rulings made during the course of the trial, prevented him from refuting the charge that he acted with criminal intent--a central element of the government's case--and that his constitutional right to \"the fullest opportunity to meet the accusation against him.... [and] to deny all the elements of the case against him,\" Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 65, 74 S.Ct. 354, 356, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954), was thereby encroached upon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "Professor Wigmore tells us that the attorney-client privilege, dating back to the 1600s, is the most ancient of the confidential communication privileges.  Originally, it was the attorney's privilege;  today, it is recognized as the client's.  See 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence Sec. 2290, at 542-44 (McNaughton rev.1961).  It may have arisen--with the advent of testimonial compulsion in Elizabethan England--as a judicial extension of the right of individuals to avoid self-incrimination.  Id. at 543-44;  Note, Developments in the Law:  Privileged Communications, 98 Harv.L.Rev. 1450, 1502 (1985).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16\n",
      "The purposes for the privilege are twofold:  first, it assures that a person seeking legal advice may do so safely.  Its existence therefore encourages the full and truthful revelation by the client of all the facts in his possession.  Second, no attorney can represent a client effectively unless the client discloses fully all the facts in his possession.  Thus, the privilege \"recognizes that sound legal advice or advocacy serves public ends and that such advice or advocacy depends upon the lawyer's being fully informed by the client.\"  Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S. 383, 389, 101 S.Ct. 677, 682, 66 L.Ed.2d 584 (1981).  The fundamental purpose of the privilege is to \" 'encourage full and frank communication between attorneys and their clients.' \"  United States v. Zolin, 491 U.S. 554, 109 S.Ct. 2619, 2626, 105 L.Ed.2d 469 (1989) (quoting Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 389, 101 S.Ct. at 682).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "Although the underlying rationale for the privilege has changed over time, it has retained its importance in the common law tradition.  Id. 109 S.Ct. at 2625-26;  see United States v. Schwimmer, 892 F.2d 237, 243 (2d Cir.1989).  The potential societal benefit may be great in cases like the one at bar, where defendant seeks legal advice in order to act within the confines of highly complex federal securities laws.  Often the importance of the interests promoted by the privilege justify the exclusion of otherwise relevant evidence.  See McCormick on Evidence Sec. 72 at 152 (E. Cleary 2d ed. 1972).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "However, the attorney-client privilege cannot at once be used as a shield and a sword.  See In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 103 (2d Cir.1987);  see also Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 15, 53 S.Ct. 465, 469, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933) (\"The privilege takes flight if the relation is abused.\").  A defendant may not use the privilege to prejudice his opponent's case or to disclose some selected communications for self-serving purposes.  See von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101-02.  Thus, the privilege may implicitly be waived when defendant asserts a claim that in fairness requires examination of protected communications.  See United States v. Exxon Corp., 94 F.R.D. 246, 249 (D.D.C.1981) (claim of good faith reliance on governmental representations waived attorney-client privilege);  Hearn v. Rhay, 68 F.R.D. 574, 581 (E.D.Wash.1975) (assertion of qualified immunity defense waived attorney-client privilege).  This waiver principle is applicable here for Bilzerian's testimony that he thought his actions were legal would have put his knowledge of the law and the basis for his understanding of what the law required in issue.  His conversations with counsel regarding the legality of his schemes would have been directly relevant in determining the extent of his knowledge and, as a result, his intent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "In support of his argument that asserting a good faith defense does not waive the attorney-client privilege, Bilzerian points to United States v. White, 887 F.2d 267 (D.C.Cir.1989). In that case attorney-client communications were admitted at trial over defense counsel's objection, in part because defendant's assertion of lack of intent was deemed to have waived the privilege.  In reversing White's conviction the court stated:  \"[a] rule thus forfeiting the privilege upon denial of mens rea would deter individuals from consulting with their lawyers to ascertain the legality of contemplated actions....\"  887 F.2d at 270.  Because intent is an element of the case that the government must prove, the court continued, waiver of the attorney-client privilege based in denial of intent \"would cut short both the privilege and the right.\"  Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "Denial of an essential element of the crime charged--here criminal intent--is a constitutional right to be carefully safeguarded.  But White is distinguishable because the district court's ruling in the instant case did not prevent defendant from denying criminal intent;  the district judge merely said that Bilzerian's own testimony as to his good faith would open the door to cross-examination, possibly including inquiry into otherwise privileged communications with his attorney.  Defendant was free to deny criminal intent either without asserting good faith or to argue his good faith defense by means of defense counsel's opening and closing statements and by his examination of witnesses.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "Another important distinction between White and the case at bar is that in the former the privileged communications were actually admitted at trial, allowing the appellate court an opportunity to examine whether defendant's case was or was not prejudiced.  See White, 887 F.2d at 272.  Because defendant did not testify as to his good faith, the privileged communications were not introduced at trial.  Hence, the trial court's ruling and our review of defendant's claims lack a specific factual context within which to determine if the defense was actually prejudiced.  See Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 41, 105 S.Ct. 460, 463, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984) (\"A reviewing court is handicapped in any effort to rule on subtle evidentiary questions outside a factual context.\").  The district court took great pains to point out that application of the privilege would hinge on the testimony elicited on direct examination.  In response to defense counsel's statement that \"[t]he government presumably then would be able to call the attorney because the privilege is gone,\" the court stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "I am not going to go to that point.  It may be that the government would be bound by the answer of the witness but I am not going to get to that point because I don't think I have to at this juncture.  I don't know how this is going to play out.  Until I do, I think it is inappropriate for me to give any advisory opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "In effect, defendant was seeking an advisory ruling in advance, assuring that the attorney-client privilege would not be waived regardless of what developed in his direct testimony.  In order for the privilege to operate effectively defendants must be able to rely on its protection, see In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 100 (\"An uncertain privilege--or one which purports to be certain, but results in widely varying applications by the courts--is little better than no privilege.\"), but courts cannot sanction the use of the privilege to prevent effective cross-examination on matters reasonably related to those introduced in direct examination.  Cf. McGautha v. California, 402 U.S. 183, 215-17, 91 S.Ct. 1454, 1471-72, 28 L.Ed.2d 711 (1971) (defendant testifying on punishment issue in a bifurcated proceeding could not assert privilege against self-incrimination on issue of guilt);  Walder, 347 U.S. at 63-65, 74 S.Ct. at 355-56 (defendant who lied on witness stand not permitted to use exclusionary rule as shield against impeachment).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "A district court's finding that a defendant has waived the attorney-client privilege is reviewed under the abuse of discretion standard.  See In re von Bulow, 828 F.2d at 101.  Here the district court's ruling did not prevent the defense from urging lack of intent.  Accordingly, the refusal to grant Bilzerian blanket protection from an implied waiver of the attorney-client privilege was not an abuse of discretion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "Bilzerian asserts the court ruled that even his own testimony regarding the steps he took to change the structure of his financing arrangements would waive the privilege.  He argues that testimony about underlying facts cannot waive the privilege, because the attorney-client privilege does not extend to underlying facts.  See Upjohn, 449 U.S. at 395-96, 101 S.Ct. at 685-86.  To the contrary, the trial court held only that Bilzerian's testimony about the changes would open the door on cross-examination to inquiry into Bilzerian's reasons for making the changes, because the topic would necessarily involve Bilzerian's state of mind.  Even defendant's trial counsel knew the testimony about the changes would be inextricably intertwined with Bilzerian's assertion of good faith.  Counsel said:  \"Mr. Bilzerian's response would be in substance that he directed these changes to be made so that--in order to enable himself to be able to report as personal funds on the 13D the funds that he received from the trust that he would not have to disclose any of the investors' names and that he thought that doing that, that he believed that was appropriate and proper\".  The trial court's ruling left defendant free to testify without getting into his state of mind, but correctly held that if he asserted his good faith, the jury would be entitled to know the basis of his understanding that his actions were legal.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Expert Testimony\n",
      "\n",
      "26\n",
      "Defendant next contends that his ability to defend himself was unfairly prejudiced by the trial court's rulings on the admissability of expert testimony.  The court erred, he says in allowing Professor John C. Coffee, a government expert witness, to testify regarding the requirements of Schedule 13D concerning disclosure of the source of funds and arrangements and understandings with others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "Particularly in complex cases involving the securities industry, expert testimony may help a jury understand unfamiliar terms and concepts.  Its use must be carefully circumscribed to assure that the expert does not usurp either the role of the trial judge in instructing the jury as to the applicable law or the role of the jury in applying that law to the facts before it.

      "As a general rule an expert's testimony on issues of law is inadmissable.  See generally, Note, Expert Legal Testimony, 97 Harv.L.Rev. 797 (1984).  The Marx and Scop cases distinguish between factual conclusions that may be included in an expert's testimony--though they embrace an ultimate issue to be decided by the jury--and opinions embodying legal conclusions that encroach upon the court's duty to instruct on the law.  See Scop, 846 F.2d at 142;  Marx, 550 F.2d at 512.  In Marx, it was held that an expert's legal opinion on the meaning of certain contract terms was outside the witness' area of expertise and was also an invasion of the court's authority to instruct the jury on the applicable law.  550 F.2d at 509-510.  In Scop, an expert's repeated statements that defendants' conduct established a manipulative and fraudulent scheme within the meaning of the securities laws exceeded the permissible scope of opinion testimony.  846 F.2d at 139.  These cases establish that although an expert may opine on an issue of fact within the jury's province, he may not give testimony stating ultimate legal conclusions based on those facts.\n",

As the government's first witness, much of Professor Coffee's testimony was general background on federal securities regulation and the filing requirements of Schedule 13D, which he presented by referring to a blank form.  Although Professor Coffee did answer a few questions based on hypothetical facts, the use of hypotheticals was first introduced by the defense on cross examination.  The mere use of hypotheticals does not usurp the jury's function of applying the law to the facts of the case.  See Scop, 846 F.2d at 143.  Further, since the expert's general testimony was not objected to at trial, the issue was waived.  See United States v.

      "Bilzerian argues further that the trial court erred in limiting the testimony of his expert witness, Lee B. Spencer, Jr., former director of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance.  The defense sought to elicit that the phrase \"personal funds,\" as generally understood in the securities industry, includes funds derived from loans of the type received by defendant.  It hoped to demonstrate with this evidence defendant's good faith in completing the disclosure form.  Judge Ward excluded this proof because it related directly to the issue of whether Bilzerian's actual 13D disclosures complied with the legal requirements.  Thus, the expert testimony would have constituted an impermissible instruction on governing law.  Defense counsel was informed that it would have an opportunity to submit proposed jury instructions regarding the scope of \"personal funds.\"\n",

Several hypothetical questions posed to Mr. Spencer included the particular facts alleged in the indictment, blurring the line between testimony regarding industry practice and an opinion on the legality of defendant's conduct.  It does not appear that the trial court's ruling was clearly wrong or that the limits placed on Spencer's earlier testimony prejudiced the defense.\n",

The evidence was part of the testimony given by Brian Murphy, a former senior tax manager with the accounting firm of Peat Marwick Main & Co. who had done accounting work for some partnerships in which defendant participated.  On direct examination the government elicited testimony that during Murphy's preparation of tax returns for Bilzerian's Hammermill-related partnerships, Bilzerian stated that the source of his contribution to the partnership was personal funds.  The trial evidence indicated to the contrary that the money was borrowed.\n",
      "\n",

      "On cross-examination, the defense sought to establish that the source of funds was irrelevant for tax purposes and that the tax returns filed on behalf of the partnerships, including the Bilzerian contribution, were correct.

Rule 404(b) prohibits the introduction of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts\" for the purpose of demonstrating defendant's propensity to commit the charged crime.  Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).  The district court noted the evidence was not admitted for that improper purpose, but in order to rebut a false impression that had been created.  Redirect may of course be used to rebut false impressions arising from cross-examination, and the scope of such redirect is within the trial court's broad discretion.  United States v.

The weighing of relevance under Rule 403 may be altered when a false impression is created by earlier testimony.  That is, evidence whose probative value might not ordinarily outweigh its prejudicial effect if offered on direct examination is admissable to rebut testimony elicited on cross examination that created a false impression.  United States v. Martinez, 775 F.2d 31, 37 (2d Cir.1985).  Balancing relevance against prejudice under Rule 403 is in the hands of the trial court and will not be overturned unless its ruling is arbitrary or irrational.  See United States v.

      "The deficiency in Bilzerian's personal tax return was not relevant to the charge of conspiracy to defraud the IRS or to any other charge in the indictment.  In addition, the testimony on cross examination related only to defendant's partnership tax return.  His personal return at most had a tenuous connection to the issues at trial.  Yet, the fact of his tax error was introduced without objection when he was cross-examined.  In such context the evidence was admissable under Fed.R.Evid. 611(b) as probative of his veracity.  The trial court was in the best position to judge whether a false impression was created by Murphy's cross-examination, and the decision to admit this evidence was within the trial court's discretion.  Here, in addition, Judge Ward gave a limiting instruction stating that the contested evidence was to be considered only in evaluating Murphy's testimony regarding his preparation of the partnership returns.

With respect to the second point, we decline to hold that the information required to be disclosed in 13D is material per se for purposes of Sec. 10(b) simply because such disclosure is required under the securities laws.

The first conspiracy involved an agreement to park Robertson & Armco stock to generate tax losses without complying with disclosure required by Sec. 13(d);  the second was a scheme to accumulate Cluett and Hammermill shares, also without providing disclosure under Sec. 13(d).

While the offense clause governs a conspiracy to commit a specific offense, defined elsewhere in the federal criminal code, the defraud clause is broader and covers agreements to interfere with or to obstruct government's lawful functions.  See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1313 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 958, 108 S.Ct. 357, 98 L.Ed.2d 382 (1987).\n",

Thus, he posits that the charges of conspiracy to defraud failed to state an offense because the conduct complained of is covered by specific statutes, that is, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 78m(d), 78ff.  This proposition is not persuasive.  In Minarik, prosecution solely under the defraud clause--despite the existence of a specific statutory offense governing the conduct--led to substantial confusion and prejudiced the defendant's ability to prepare for trial.

As noted, the SEC is charged with administering and enforcing securities laws, and in order to perform its function must receive accurate and truthful disclosure.

False records also were generated to substantiate tax deductions that Bilzerian claimed on his 1985 tax return.  As to each of the conspiracies charged there is adequate evidence from which a rational juror could have concluded that a conspiracy existed to achieve at least one criminal objective, that is to say, either to violate Sec. 13(d) or to defraud the SEC and the IRS.\n",

      "Bilzerian was not denied a fair trial because the district court precluded him from denying criminal intent without waiving the attorney-client privilege.

If Bilzerian had asserted good faith on direct examination, he could not use the attorney-client privilege to avoid cross-examination regarding the basis of that claim.  See United States v. Miller, 600 F.2d 498, 501 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 955, 100 S.Ct. 434, 62 L.Ed.2d 327 (1979).\n",

      "Bilzerian's contention that the district court erroneously admitted testimony by the government's expert while it excluded similar expert testimony by the defense has no merit.  At trial, Judge Ward allowed the government witness, Professor John C. Coffee, to provide background information regarding the securities laws and the filing requirements of Schedule 13D.  The district court permitted Bilzerian's expert, Lee B. Spencer, Jr., to do the same, but prohibited him from opining on the propriety of describing unsecured loans as \"personal funds,\" in a Schedule 13D.\n",

      "Third, Bilzerian's contention that the district court erred in admitting evidence of an error in Bilzerian's 1986 personal tax return is not persuasive.  Brian Murphy, an accountant who prepared tax returns for a partnership in which Bilzerian participated, testified that Bilzerian told him that part of Bilzerian's capital contribution was personal funds.  On cross-examination, Bilzerian sought to establish that the source of the funds had no effect on the partnership tax return.  Bilzerian also elicited testimony regarding the accuracy of the partnership tax return.  On redirect, over defense objection, the government inquired into the accuracy of Bilzerian's personal tax return, and elicited testimony that Bilzerian had understated his income by $4 million.  Judge Ward denied Bilzerian's motion for a mistrial.  He found that Bilzerian's cross-examination had created the impression that Bilzerian accurately reported the income on all tax returns, and this had opened the door to the government's redirect.  Judge Ward acted within his discretion in admitting this evidence on redirect, to rebut the possible misimpression, arising from cross-examination, that Bilzerian accurately reported on all of his 1986 tax returns.  See United States v. Mang Sun Wong, 884 F.2d 1537, 1544 (2d Cir.1989), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 1140, 107 L.Ed.2d 1045 (1990).\n",

Sec. 1001 (1988) (\"Section 1001\"), for alleged mistatements and omissions in informational reports required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 because the government could prosecute him under Section 32(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.

      "Fifth, Bilzerian asserts that even if his conduct constituted offenses under Section 1001, constitutional venue was proper only in Washington, D.C., where the reports containing the alleged misstatements and omissions were filed with the SEC.  Venue in the Southern District of New York was proper, as this was where the documents were prepared and signed.  See United States v. Mendel, 746 F.2d 155, 165 (2d Cir.1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1213, 105 S.Ct. 1184, 84 L.Ed.2d 331 (1985).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "88\n",
      "Sixth, there is no merit to Bilzerian's claim that the government failed to prove an offense under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 78j(b) (1988) (\"Section 10(b)\") or Rule 10b-5, which prohibit fraudulent practices in connection with the purchase or sale of a security, because it failed to prove a \"fraud\" within the meaning of the provisions.  He contends there was no fraud because his misstatements and omissions were not material, and that no rational jury could have found materiality.  The determination of materiality generally is a jury issue.  In accordance with the teachings of TSC Industries, Inc. v. Northway, Inc., 426 U.S. 438, 96 S.Ct. 2126, 48 L.Ed.2d 757 (1976), and Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224, 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978, 983, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988), the district court instructed the jury that a material fact \"is one that would have been significant to a reasonable investor's investment decision.\"  The jury's verdict was supported by ample evidence.\n",

      "\n",
      "89\n",
      "Finally, Bilzerian argues that his convictions for conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. Sec. 371 (1988) should be reversed because the same conduct cannot constitute both a conspiracy to defraud the United States and a conspiracy to commit substantive offenses.  We rejected this argument in United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1313 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 958, 108 S.Ct. 357, 98 L.Ed.2d 382 (1987) and in United States v.

Spencer, a former Director of the SEC's Division of Corporate Finance, was prevented by the court from answering questions that were in principle indistinguishable from those answered by Professor Coffee.  Nevertheless, Professor Coffee's testimony did not deviate in substance from the instructions given by the court to the jury and did not contain any matter that might otherwise prejudice the jury.

      "With regard to the redirect examination of Murphy regarding Bilzerian's personal tax return, I believe that the redirect examination was improper.  The cross-examination of Murphy by Bilzerian's counsel concerned the partnership returns only and merely established that the source of Bilzerian's funds was irrelevant to the partnership tax returns.  In no way did this cross-examination open the door for questions regarding Bilzerian's personal tax return, and the question was improper.  Reluctantly, however, I have concluded that this error was also harmless.  When Bilzerian took the stand, he was cross-examined about his personal tax returns and was able to provide an exculpatory explanation of pertinent events that blunted the impact of the redirect examination of Murphy.\n",

      "I respectfully dissent from the conviction under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001.  I, of course, do not disagree with the general canon relied upon by my colleagues that criminal statutes may overlap and that, when they do, the government may choose to indict under one rather than another.  I cannot agree, however, that, because criminal statutes may overlap, Section 1001 must overlap with Section 32(a) of the 1934 Act.  The bottom line is Congressional intent.  Another canon of construction thus dictates that courts must insure that every part of a statute be given meaning and not be rendered superfluous.  See United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538-39, 75 S.Ct. 513, 519-20, 99 L.Ed. 615 (1955).  Because we have construed Section 101's prohibition on false statements as not requiring a finding of materiality, Section 32(a)'s prohibition on \"false [statements] ... with respect to any material fact\" is superfluous.  My colleagues' interpretation seems particularly questionable because the two provisions were the product of virtually simultaneous Congressional consideration and action and, at the time of passage, Section 1001 contained more stringent penalties.  It certainly seems somewhat odd to me that Congress would pass Section 32(a), which specifically applies to filings required by the federal securities laws, and less than twelve days later render portions of it superfluous by passing a very general statute that required a lesser standard of proof and provided harsher penalties.  With the exception of United States v. Fields, 592 F.2d 638 (2d Cir.1978), the cases relied upon by my colleagues are from other circuits and involved false statements in ongoing investigations.  Fields, moreover, does not stand for the proposition for which it is cited, because it deals only with the issue of materiality.\n",

      "OPINION\n",
      "FELDMAN, Chief Justice.\n",
      "On October 3, 1991, Robert Charles Towery (\"Defendant\") and Randy Allen Barker were charged in Maricopa County on six counts: first-degree murder, armed robbery, first-degree burglary, kidnapping, theft, and attempted theft. About six months before trial, the trial judge granted Defendant's motion to sever. Defendant's murder trial began on August 3, 1992. Eleven days later, the jury found him guilty of felony murder and all other counts. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge sentenced Defendant to death for the murder and to concurrent prison terms of five to twenty-one years for the other counts.\n",
      "This automatic appeal of the death sentence followed. Ariz. Const. art. 6, § 5(3); A.R.S. §§ 13-4031 and 13-4033(A).\n",
      "\n",
      "STATEMENT OF FACTS\n",
      "In exchange for a reduced charge of second-degree murder, Barker testified against Defendant and provided much of the State's evidence. Other witnesses corroborated some critical features of Barker's story and connected Defendant with the charged offenses. Nevertheless, the State's case rested on Barker's testimony. His version of the facts follows.\n",
      "A. Barker's story\n",
      "Defendant, Barker, and John Meacham rented a three-bedroom house in Scottsdale, Arizona. Defendant occupied one bedroom with his girlfriend, Diane Weber, and her infant daughter. Barker occupied another bedroom with his then-girlfriend, Monique Rousseau. For several weeks, Defendant and Barker had discussed \"pulling off a robbery\" of one of two possible victims known to Defendant. On September 4, 1991, they decided to rob Mark Jones at his home.\n",
      "That evening they drove in Barker's car to a Denny's Restaurant where they called a taxi. The taxi dropped them off near Jones' home. They walked to the house and knocked on the door. When Jones answered, Defendant said his car had broken down and asked if he and Barker could come in to use the telephone. Defendant asked Jones, \"Do you remember me? I'm from R and D Automotive.\" Jones had been introduced to Defendant on a prior occasion when Defendant sought counseling about his new business enterprise. Jones invited them in and showed them the telephone. While Barker faked a telephone call, Defendant opened his briefcase and pulled out a gun. The briefcase also contained gloves, plastic tie wraps, handcuffs, and a large veterinary syringe apparently filled with battery acid. After Defendant and Barker put on gloves, Barker handcuffed Jones. Defendant rummaged through the house, took Jones' car keys, and loaded Jones' Lincoln with a television, photocopy machine, cameras, jewelry, and other items. Defendant removed Jones' wallet from his back pocket and took about $200 and credit cards. They also took $1,000 from a desk drawer.\n",
      "Before leaving, Defendant and Barker took Jones to the master bedroom at gunpoint, uncuffing him while he used the bathroom along the way. They asked him whether he was expecting anyone soon, and Jones said no. According to Barker, Defendant offered Jones \"about two choices in the matter of how we could leave him. One was ... [to] tie him up, ... the other was to introduce a drug into him to make him sleep instead of being tied up.\" Jones chose to be put to sleep and was laid face down on the bed with his hands bound behind his back. Contrary to his statement to Jones, Defendant apparently believed the injected substance would kill Jones.\n",
      "At his request, Jones' shoes were removed to make him more comfortable. Defendant made several attempts to inject the contents of the syringe into Jones' arm, pushing the needle all the way through a vein. The drug having no effect, Jones pretended to sleep by *175 snoring. Determined to kill Jones, Defendant made a noose out of plastic tie wraps from his briefcase, slipped it over Jones' head, and pulled tightly on its end to strangle Jones. Jones did not struggle but made choking and gagging sounds. Defendant then cut and removed the tie-wrap noose from Jones' neck. Believing Jones was not yet dead, Defendant made another noose \"like the first one ... popped [it] over the head, and pulled tight with a `zip' sound,\" explained Barker.\n",
      "The two men then loaded a large television into Jones' other car, a Dodge convertible. While trying to start the Dodge, Barker set off its alarm. Barker jumped into the Lincoln and the two men drove away with Defendant at the wheel. Barker allegedly threw the empty syringe out the window into an oleander hedge[1] as they drove back to Denny's to get Barker's car. They returned to their home, unloaded the goods, putting some into Meacham's bedroom, and removed a compact disk player from the Lincoln's dash. Defendant then drove the Lincoln to the parking lot of an apartment complex while Barker followed in his car. They parked the Lincoln there and returned home. A security guard at the complex saw the men and later identified Defendant in a photo lineup.\n",
      "The next morning, Meacham returned from work to discover in his bedroom items he had not seen before. Defendant, Barker, and Diane were also in the house. Meanwhile, two employees of the golf club that Jones frequented had looked for Jones and found his body about mid-morning that day.\n",
      "B. Defendant's version\n",
      "Defendant testified and offered an alibi. According to Defendant, on the night of the robbery he had driven Barker to Denny's in Barker's car. He had a soda until Barker's taxi arrived, then drove to Zorba's, an adult book store, where he had arranged to meet Tina Collins. While waiting, Defendant went inside to buy a book and returned to his car. Tina arrived at Zorba's about fifteen minutes after Defendant. They then drove and parked near Defendant's home, talking for about two hours in the car. Defendant returned to Zorba's, dropped Tina off, and went to meet Barker at a Circle K near their house. Because Barker was not there as planned, Defendant went home. Barker soon arrived home with a stolen car and stolen property. Defendant claimed he helped Barker unload the goods and dispose of the stolen car. To account for the stolen property police found in his possession, Defendant claimed he had bought the items from Barker.\n",
      "Tina Collins testified by videotape and gave the following story, corroborating Defendant's version. She first met Defendant about two weeks before the murder at a party, where they discussed performing a sex act on Defendant's girlfriend and arranged to meet again on September 4. They talked over the telephone on September 4 and planned to meet at nine o'clock that night to negotiate a deal. Tina did not arrive until 9:10 or 9:15 and joined Defendant in a black TransAm he was driving. They drove to the parking lot of an office building, talked for an hour, went to a convenience store for sodas, and returned to the parking lot to talk some more. After meeting for a couple of hours, Defendant drove Tina back to Zorba's. When asked whether she saw any unusual equipment in the car, Tina said she saw a gun and a police scanner, which she first thought was a walkie-talkie. Nothing in the record disputes Tina's professed observations.[2]\n",
      "*176 The jury apparently believed Tina and Defendant less than Barker and found Defendant guilty of first-degree murder. At the sentencing hearing, the trial judge found three statutory aggravating factors and two mitigating factors. In aggravation, the State proved that Defendant (1) had been convicted of a crime for which a life sentence was imposable,[3] (2) committed the murder for financial gain,[4] and (3) committed the murder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner.[5] The judge found that the mitigating factors, Defendant's drug-impaired capacity to conform his conduct to the law and his codefendant's lenient plea-bargained sentence, were not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. Accordingly, the judge sentenced Defendant to death.\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "Defendant takes issue with a number of the trial judge's procedural rulings, arguing that they constituted reversible error. He also challenges the trial judge's findings at the sentencing hearing and the constitutionality of Arizona's death penalty scheme. We consider each of Defendant's arguments.\n",
      "TRIAL ISSUES\n",
      "A. Limiting cross-examination of an accomplice witness\n",
      "Defendant contends that by twice limiting his cross-examination of Barker, the trial judge violated his right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to confront a key witness. In one instance the judge prohibited the defense from asking Barker what his attorney had said to him about his chances of receiving the death penalty without a plea bargain. In the second instance, the judge barred the defense from probing Barker about his belief in the occult. Defendant charges that both of these rulings infringed his right to effectively cross-examine an important witness and were fundamental error.\n",
      "1. The confrontation right and the attorney-client privilege\n",
      "To show Barker had a motive to testify for the State and inculpate Defendant, even if he had to lie, Defendant cross-examined Barker about benefits he expected in return for his plea agreement. Defendant asked Barker whether his attorney had told him that the State might seek the death penalty if Barker did not cooperate with the prosecutor. Barker's lawyer was present and objected on grounds of attorney-client privilege, and the judge sustained the objection.\n",
      "A defendant has great latitude to cross-examine an \"accomplice or co-defendant who has turned State's evidence and testifies on behalf of the State in a trial of his co-defendant.\" State v. Morales, 120 Ariz. 517, 520, 587 P.2d 236, 239 (1978) (citations omitted). A trial judge who excludes testimony that would show bias and interest in this circumstance may commit reversible error. Id. Even if the defendant fails to object or give an offer of proof when such testimony is precluded, error may be found if the context of the questions makes their purpose clear. Ariz. R. Evid. 103(a).\n",
      "If cross-examination into privileged areas is necessary to show a witness' bias, the United States Supreme Court has held that the interest of confidentiality can be \"outweighed by [the defendant's] right to probe into the influence of possible bias in the testimony of a crucial identification witness.\" See Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S. 308, 319, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1111, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). In the few reported cases in which the confrontation right has collided with the attorney-client privilege, courts have employed a fact-specific balancing test to resolve the competing interests of confidentiality and the defendant's right to impeach an important government witness. See, e.g., State v. Cascone, 195 Conn. 183, 487 A.2d 186, 190-91 (1985) (trial court's exclusion of a co-defendant's pretrial statement to his attorney *177 that would exculpate the defendant was not harmless error).\n",
      "In United States ex. rel. Blackwell v. Franzen, the court balanced the relevant interests:\n",
      "[T]he question in each case must finally be whether defendant's inability to make the inquiry created a substantial danger of prejudice by depriving him of the ability to test the truth of the witness's direct testimony. To answer that question the court must look to the record as a whole and to the alternative means open to the defendant to impeach the witness. The court must ultimately decide whether the probative value of the alleged privileged communication was such that the defendant's right to effective cross-examination was substantially diminished.\n",
      "688 F.2d 496, 500-01 (7th Cir.1982) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1072, 103 S.Ct. 1529, 75 L.Ed.2d 950 (1983).\n",
      "In Franzen, the defendant cross-examined his accomplice, who had agreed to testify for the state. The defendant elicited testimony from the witness that he had told his own attorney \"he was beaten [by the prosecutor] into making that statement [that inculpated defendant]\" to show that the prosecutor had induced the accomplice to incriminate the defendant. Id. at 499. The state objected, and the trial court sustained the objection on grounds that the attorney-client privilege \"overrides any relevancy it may have to the issues in [the] case.\" Id. However, because there was already ample evidence in the record to impeach the accomplice's testimony, the circuit court upheld the trial court's ruling. Id. at 501; see also Neku v. United States, 620 A.2d 259, 263 (D.C. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1003, 114 S.Ct. 577, 126 L.Ed.2d 476 (1993).\n",
      "As long as the jury heard evidence relevant to Barker's possible motives for testifying against Defendant, we assume it could then fairly assess Barker's truthfulness. No doubt Barker's plea agreement was relevant to his bias and interest. The jury apparently realized this and sent a note to the judge during deliberations asking what benefits Barker received in exchange for his testimony. Reporter's Transcript (R.T.), Aug. 13, 1992, at 110. The jury's note asked, \"Does Randy Barker have anything to gain if Towery is convicted? Are we allowed to see the plea agreement?\" In response to the note, the judge told the jurors they had all the evidence and instructed them to rely on their personal recollections and collective notes.\n",
      "At issue then is whether the jury knew what benefits Barker would receive from his plea bargain. If the statement made to Barker by his lawyer was sufficiently probative of Barker's credibility to outweigh the interests protected by the attorney-client privilege,[6] then the judge abused her discretion in prohibiting Defendant from asking about a privileged communication.\n",
      "The record shows that even without disclosure of whether Barker's lawyer told Barker that the State would seek the death penalty if he did not cooperate, other evidence informed the jury that Barker knew he could escape death by cooperating and testifying. The jury knew that the State would have pursued the death penalty if Barker were convicted of first-degree murder. Earlier in the day, the jury heard a stipulation that prior to Barker's plea agreement the State had filed a notice of intent to seek the death penalty if Barker were convicted of first-degree murder. The jury knew that Barker then made a plea agreement with the State for second-degree murder. In short, although the jury questioned Barker's benefits if Defendant were convicted, as evidenced by the note to the judge, the jury must have understood all of the benefits Barker received from his plea agreement and testimony when it decided Defendant's guilt. The evidence would have been merely cumulative had the judge permitted Defendant to ask about Barker's privileged communication with his attorney. Moreover, in protecting *178 the attorney-client privilege, the judge did not impair Defendant's ability to obtain the information he wanted. Defense counsel could have established a motive for Barker to lie without invading the attorney-client privilege. He simply could have asked if Barker knew or believed he would have been eligible for the death penalty or a life sentence had he not agreed to testify. In upholding the privilege, therefore, the judge did not abuse her discretion.\n",
      "2. Cross-examination of Barker's belief in satanism\n",
      "On cross-examination, the defense asked Barker about his belief in the occult after he revealed that he had dialed straight sixes while feigning a telephone call from the victim's house.[7] The judge sustained the State's objection on grounds of relevance, basing her ruling on Ariz. R. Evid. 610 and art. 2, § 12 of the Arizona Constitution.[8] These provisions bar questioning a witness about religious beliefs as a way to enhance or attack the witness' credibility. On appeal, Defendant contends that testimony about Barker's religious beliefs, if such they were, was not offered to impeach his credibility but to show that the antisocial tenets of his beliefs disposed Barker to engage in criminal conduct and to commit the murder.\n",
      "A witness' religious beliefs are admissible if offered for some legitimate purpose other than attacking witness credibility. See State v. West, 168 Ariz. 292, 296, 812 P.2d 1110, 1114 (1991) (reference to religion is proper when used to justify defendant's conduct); State v. Stone, 151 Ariz. 455, 458, 728 P.2d 674, 677 (App. 1986) (if evidence of religious belief \"is probative of something other than veracity, it is not inadmissible simply because it may also involve a religious subject as well.\"). Defendant argues that the evidence was relevant to an issue other than Barker's veracity. Had he been allowed to develop testimony about Barker's satanic beliefs, the jury might have been persuaded to believe that Barker, not Defendant, was the killer. In addition, although the jury nevertheless could have found Defendant's involvement sufficient to convict him for felony murder, his death eligibility was not a foregone conclusion. Although the judge found beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant was the killer, evidence that Barker was profoundly touched by some satanic belief might have altered that finding.\n",
      "Defendant, however, made no offer of proof of what Barker's testimony would have shown. Nor does the context of the question indicate the nature of Barker's satanic belief or show it was substantively *179 relevant. When an objection to the introduction of evidence has been sustained, an offer of proof showing the evidence's relevance and admissibility is ordinarily required to assert error on appeal. State v. Bay, 150 Ariz. 112, 115, 722 P.2d 280, 283 (1986); MORRIS K. UDALL ET AL., ARIZONA PRACTICE: LAW OF EVIDENCE § 13, at 20 (2d ed. 1982). Given that counsel normally does not know in advance what a hostile witness will say on cross-examination, the offer-of-proof requirement for considering a claim on appeal may be relaxed when the court sustains an objection to a question asked on cross-examination. JOHN W. STRONG, ET AL., 1 McCORMICK ON EVIDENCE § 51, at 197 (4th ed. 1992). Even so, something more than speculation about possible answers is required to show prejudice. At a minimum, an offer of proof stating with reasonable specificity what the evidence would have shown is required. See id. at 197-98. In Arizona, it has been suggested that counsel be required to discover evidence that would make the proffered testimony relevant and make it known to the court. State v. Quinn, 121 Ariz. 582, 585, 592 P.2d 778, 781 (App. 1978).\n",
      "We recognize, however, that discovery in criminal cases is much more limited than in civil cases. Victims of crimes, for example, can refuse interview requests by defense counsel under the Victims' Bill of Rights. Ariz. Const. art. 2, § 2.1; Ariz. R.Crim. P. 39(b)(11). Nonetheless, when the context of the examination fails to reveal the nature of the expected answer, the proponent of the precluded evidence must seek permission from the trial judge to make the offer of proof so that the reviewing court can determine whether the trial judge erred in precluding the evidence. STRONG, ET AL., supra § 51, at 197 n. 10; see also State v. Affeld, 307 Or. 125, 764 P.2d 220, 222 (1988). It is remotely conceivable that Barker might have revealed he was driven by a satanic force or some other evil belief to commit criminal acts. The only hint of a satanic motive for Barker's participation in the crime, however, was his dialing sixes on the telephone. That alone has little probative value in establishing a motive to kill. Assuming Barker had a satanic altar in his room, Defendant failed to discover how often Barker used it and how its use was related to his criminal conduct. In fact, Barker's claim that he used to believe in the occult indicates that the alleged altar no longer had any religious significance to him. Defendant's failure to establish the connection between Barker's old belief in the occult and the crime by an offer of proof in the record makes it impossible to evaluate whether the trial judge unfairly limited Defendant's cross-examination of Barker. On this record, we see no probative value in the precluded evidence apart from its effect on Barker's credibility. Thus we find no error in the judge's precluding it.\n",
      "B. Defendant's right to a free transcript of a previous, unrelated trial\n",
      "Before trial, Defendant asked the court by written motion to provide a free transcript of a prior trial in which he had been convicted of armed robbery. That trial took place in mid-March 1992, about six months after Jones' murder and about five months before Defendant's homicide trial. He stated that he needed the transcript because the prosecutor had filed notice that the State intended to call witnesses from the armed robbery trial.[9] The judge denied his request on grounds that \"no good cause has been shown for the need of the trial transcripts,\" advising him to renew his motion \"setting forth some facts which demonstrate an actual need other than the bare conclusion that he needs the transcript `to prepare a defense'.\" Minute Entry, June 13, 1992, at 19. Defendant made no further request for the transcript. On appeal, Defendant claims that in denying him valuable defense information, the judge violated his equal protection and due process rights.\n",
      "The United States Supreme Court has held that requiring an indigent *180 defendant to demonstrate a particularized need for a free transcript of a prior mistrial or preliminary hearing can violate equal protection. Britt v. North Carolina, 404 U.S. 226, 227, 92 S.Ct. 431, 433-34, 30 L.Ed.2d 400 (1971); Roberts v. LaVallee, 389 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. 194, 19 L.Ed.2d 41 (1967); Griffin v. Illinois, 351 U.S. 12, 17, 76 S.Ct. 585, 590, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956) (\"In criminal trials, a State can no more discriminate on account of poverty then on account of religion, race, or color.\"). Only financial need, not particularized need, must be shown. Britt held that two factors are relevant in determining if a trial court has erred by refusing an indigent defendant a free trial transcript: (1) the value of the transcript to the defendant for an effective defense at trial or on appeal, and (2) \"the availability of alternative devices that would fulfil the same functions as the transcript.\" Britt, 404 U.S. at 227, 92 S.Ct. at 434.[10] The transcript from a prior mistrial has been recognized as a valuable resource for impeaching witnesses, guiding discovery, and developing trial strategy. Id. at 232, 92 S.Ct. at 436 (Douglas, J., dissenting). Thus, when a transcript from a mistrial is requested for use at the retrial, the value of the transcript is generally presumed without a showing of specific need. United States v. Rosales-Lopez, 617 F.2d 1349, 1355-56 (9th Cir.1980), aff'd, 451 U.S. 182, 101 S.Ct. 1629, 68 L.Ed.2d 22 (1981). A preliminary hearing transcript may also be presumed to have value in connection with a pending trial. See id.\n",
      "In this case, however, Defendant asked for a free transcript of his trial on an unrelated charge. Our cases have held that there is no presumed value to the defense in the transcript of a co-defendant's trial. See State v. Tison, 129 Ariz. 526, 540, 633 P.2d 335, 349 (1981) (indigent defendant must show special need in requesting a transcript of co-defendant's trial), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 882, 103 S.Ct. 180, 74 L.Ed.2d 147 (1982); State v. Razinha, 123 Ariz. 355, 358, 599 P.2d 808, 811 (App. 1979) (citing cases). But see State v. Campbell, 215 N.W.2d 227 (Iowa 1974). Although the present question is one of first impression for this court, we partially answered it in Tison. Tison claimed the trial judge erred in denying him a free transcript of his co-defendant's trial on the same charges. In holding that there is no presumed value of a co-defendant's trial transcript even when the same witnesses are called, we emphasized that the constitution does not require the State to provide every service that \"might be of benefit to an indigent defendant ... but only to assure the indigent defendant an adequate opportunity to present his claims fairly....\" Tison, 129 Ariz. at 540, 633 P.2d at 349, quoting Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 616, 94 S.Ct. 2437, 2447, 41 L.Ed.2d 341 (1974).\n",
      "Because a mistrial effectively serves as a \"dry run\" of the State's case, a transcript is ordinarily considered invaluable as a discovery device and tool for impeaching prosecution witnesses at the subsequent trial. Britt, 404 U.S. at 228, 92 S.Ct. at 434. But when the transcript sought is that for an unrelated charge  even against the same defendant  the crime, victim(s), time, place, facts, and witnesses are ordinarily different. Thus, the rationale for the presumption of need does not apply to a transcript of the defendant's trial on unrelated charges. Its value must be established, and unless the defendant demonstrates a specific need for the trial transcript, the court does not err in concluding that the transcript is not necessary for an effective defense. The mere fact that a witness who testified at the first, unrelated trial may be called at the second is not sufficient for a presumption of value. See Fisher v. Hargett, 997 F.2d 1095, 1098 (5th Cir.1993) (free transcript of a prior trial involving a different victim and offense at a different time not constitutionally required); McAllister v. Garrison, 569 F.2d 813, 815 (4th Cir.1978) (holding that defendant must *181 make a reasonable showing of transcript's value even though common witnesses called), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 928, 98 S.Ct. 2824, 56 L.Ed.2d 771 (1978). When asking for a free transcript of an unrelated trial, therefore, a defendant may be required to demonstrate some reasonable probability of defense value.\n",
      "Defendant said he needed the robbery trial transcript because the State intended to call common witnesses from the armed robbery trial. Despite the judge's request, Defendant made no further showing of particularized need for the transcript. Without a sufficient showing of the transcript's value for an effective defense, the judge did not err in denying Defendant a free copy. We reach this conclusion, as we must, the same way the judge did, on the record as it then existed.\n",
      "Although the robbery victim did not testify at the homicide trial, three other witnesses testified at both trials. At the murder trial, one of these witnesses, Defendant's roommate John Meacham, testified that he overheard Defendant make an inculpatory statement. The same prosecutor had elicited similar testimony from Meacham at the robbery trial. Defendant argues that the statements attributed to him by Meacham refer to the same incident but were introduced at two separate trials to prove two separate crimes. Because Defendant had different lawyers at each trial, his trial lawyer in the present case may not have known about Meacham's previous testimony without reading the transcript.\n",
      "Defendant is correct that the transcript of Meacham's robbery trial testimony might have alerted defense counsel that the State was making inconsistent use of Meacham's testimony. Thus the transcript might have helped impeach Meacham at the murder trial.[11] His testimony at both trials was offered to prove Defendant's culpability in unrelated crimes. But neither Defendant nor the trial judge could have reasonably anticipated that the prosecutor would make inconsistent use of the same testimony. Because the prosecutor did not inform the court of his intent to elicit the same testimony from an unrelated trial, the court had no way of knowing that the requested transcript might help the defense. If the transcript would have been valuable to Defendant, any prejudice caused by the denial of a free copy was attributable not to the trial judge, who ruled correctly on the record before her, but to the prosecutor. Thus, we find no equal protection violation.\n",
      "C. Defendant's inculpatory statement  judicial estoppel and prosecutorial misconduct\n",
      "At Defendant's prior armed robbery trial Meacham testified that he overheard Defendant say, \"I tried to get this old man to do what I wanted him to do, but he wouldn't do it.\" State v. Towery, Maricopa County No. CR 91-02512, R.T., Mar. 10, 1992, at 98. At the homicide trial, Meacham was again called to testify. His testimony approximated the testimony he gave in the armed robbery trial: he said that he heard Defendant tell Barker that he was \"having a hard time with an old man so he had  he had a hard time tying him up, so he had to knock him down.\" The victims of both crimes were older men.\n",
      "Because Defendant had different counsel at the two trials and was denied a transcript of the robbery trial, we must assume that his trial attorney in the present case did not know the substance of Meacham's testimony at the robbery trial. Moreover, before putting Meacham on the stand in the murder trial, the prosecutor failed to notify the court or defense counsel that he would present evidence of the same admission Meacham described in the robbery trial. The context of Meacham's testimony at both trials makes it quite clear, and the State concedes, that Meacham heard one admission about one crime. But the admission was used in two trials to help prove two unrelated criminal acts. Defendant claims that by presenting evidence of a single incident at two separate *182 trials to prove two separate, unrelated crimes, the prosecutor violated Defendant's due process rights and the doctrine of estoppel by engaging in misconduct.\n",
      "1. Judicial Estoppel\n",
      "Defendant argues that \"the prosecutor [used] the same evidence to convict the appellant of two separate crimes ... attempting to prove a fact in one trial and seeking to prove an inconsistent fact in another trial with the same evidence.\" Opening Brief at 32. The error in using the evidence, in Defendant's words, is that it \"`perverts' the integrity of our system of jurisprudence.\" Id. at 35. Protecting the integrity of the judicial process is the universally recognized purpose of judicial estoppel. See, e.g., 18 C. WRIGHT, A. MILLER & E. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE § 4477 (1981 and Supp. 1990); 1B J. MOORE, J. LUCAS & T. CURRIER, MOORE'S FEDERAL PRACTICE 405[8], at 239, 240 (2d ed. 1988); Scarano v. Central R.R., 203 F.2d 510, 513 (3d Cir.1953).\n",
      "Judicial estoppel prevents a party from taking an inconsistent position in successive or separate actions. This court has long recognized that\n",
      "[a]s a general rule, a party who has assumed a particular position in a judicial proceeding is estopped to assume an inconsistent position in a subsequent proceeding involving the same parties and questions.\n",
      "Martin v. Wood, 71 Ariz. 457, 459, 229 P.2d 710, 711-12 (1951) (citing 31 C.J.S. ESTOPPEL § 119, at 381). Judicial estoppel is not intended to protect individual litigants but is invoked to protect the integrity of the judicial process by preventing a litigant from using the courts to gain an unfair advantage. See 31 C.J.S. ESTOPPEL § 121, at 260; see also Yanez v. United States, 989 F.2d 323, 326 (9th Cir.1993); Yniguez v. Arizona, 939 F.2d 727, 739 (9th Cir.1991); Russell v. Rolfs, 893 F.2d 1033, 1037 (9th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1260, 111 S.Ct. 2915, 115 L.Ed.2d 1078 (1991); In re Cassidy, 892 F.2d at 641. Although judicial estoppel is usually invoked in civil cases,[12] courts have also applied it in criminal cases. See, e.g., State v. Washington, 142 Wis.2d 630, 419 N.W.2d 275, 277 (App. 1987).\n",
      "The doctrine's application to criminal cases usually involves a defendant who asserts one position at trial and another on appeal. See Harrison v. Labor & Indus. Review Comm'n, 187 Wis.2d 491, 523 N.W.2d 138, 140 (App. 1994). Nonetheless, criminal courts have indicated that judicial estoppel would preclude the state from changing its version of the facts in separate proceedings involving the same matter to protect the defendant's right to due process. See People v. Gayfield, 261 Ill. App.3d 379, 199 Ill.Dec. 123, 128-29, 633 N.E.2d 919, 924-25 (1994) (suggesting that the state would be estopped from inconsistently claiming in separate proceedings that different defendants shot the same victim); Russell v. Rolfs, 893 F.2d at 1037-39 (state prohibited from arguing that criminal defendant's appellate petition is procedurally barred in state court after successfully arguing in district court that defendant had an adequate state remedy).\n",
      "We believe the doctrine of judicial estoppel is no less applicable in a criminal than in a civil trial. Any other rule would permit absurd results. For example, if the state had evidence that a defendant admitted robbing the convenience store, absent judicial estoppel the state could use that evidence to convict the defendant of every convenience store robbery in the city, affirming the evidence as relevant in each case, all the while knowing that the defendant made only one admission of a single act.\n",
      "Three requirements must exist before the court can apply judicial estoppel: (1) the parties must be the same, (2) the question involved must be the same, and (3) the party asserting the inconsistent position must have been successful in the prior judicial proceeding. See Standage Ventures, Inc. v. State, 114 Ariz. 480, 562 P.2d 360 (1977). In the present case the parties are the same. Because Defendant's admission could only pertain to one of the crimes, the question involved in both proceedings is also the same: did Defendant admit committing *183 the charged crime in Meacham's presence? However, even though the parties and the questions are the same, a majority of courts, including Arizona, refuse to invoke judicial estoppel unless the position first asserted was successfully maintained.[13]Taylor v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., 182 Ariz. 39, 44, 893 P.2d 39, 44 (App. 1995), vacated in part, 185 Ariz. 174, 913 P.2d 1092 (1996).\n",
      "The prior position was successfully maintained only if the party gained judicial relief as a result of asserting the particular position in the first proceeding. See id. at 44, 893 P.2d at 44; Standage, 114 Ariz. at 484, 562 P.2d at 364; State Farm Auto. Ins. Co. v. Civil Service Employees Ins. Co., 19 Ariz. App. 594, 600, 509 P.2d 725, 731 (1973). Prior success has also been defined as requiring that the court in the prior action accepted the first position. Edwards v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., 690 F.2d 595, 598 (6th Cir.1982); see also Chaveriat v. Williams Pipe Line Co., 11 F.3d 1420, 1427 (1993) (litigant must obtain victory on prior ground); Rand G. Boyers, Precluding Inconsistent Statements: The Doctrine of Judicial Estoppel, 80 NW. U.L. REV. 1244, 1256 (1986) (the requirement of prior judicial acceptance \"is satisfied whenever a prior court `has adopted the position [contrary to that now] urged by that party, either as a preliminary matter or as part of a final disposition.'\") (citations omitted) (alterations by author).\n",
      "Prior success is a prerequisite to the application of judicial estoppel because absent judicial acceptance of the prior position, there is no risk of inconsistent results. See Edwards, 690 F.2d at 599; see also Boyers, supra, 80 Nw. U.L. REV. at 1253. Because the judicial process is unimpaired absent inconsistent results, and because judicial estoppel is recognized to protect the integrity of the judicial process, invocation of the doctrine is unwarranted without prior success on  or judicial acceptance of  the first position. See USLIFE Corp. v. U.S. Life Ins. Co., 560 F. Supp. 1302, 1305 (N.D.Tex. 1983) (citing Edwards, 690 F.2d at 599); C. WRIGHT, A. MILLER & E. COOPER, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE § 4477 (1983).\n",
      "The guilty verdict on the armed robbery charge establishes that the jury accepted the State's position that Defendant committed that crime. The robbery verdict does not, however, establish that Defendant's admission to committing the armed robbery was a key element of the guilty verdict. Indeed, it is entirely possible that the jury in that case gave little or no consideration to Meacham's testimony, especially if his testimony constituted only an insignificant fraction of the total evidence offered to establish Defendant's guilt. See Boyers, supra, Nw. U.L. REV. at 1257. For this reason, judicial estoppel is generally not applied when the first inconsistent position was not a significant factor in the initial proceeding. Id. at 1263.\n",
      "Rather, the court, keeping in mind the `unnecessary hardship' that may result from invoking judicial estoppel when the position was unimportant in the initial proceeding, determines whether the importance of the issue in the particular case justifies invocation of the doctrine.\n",
      "Id. (citations omitted).\n",
      "Thus, to determine if the prior success requirement for invocation of judicial estoppel was met in the armed robbery trial, this court must examine the record of that trial to determine whether Meacham's testimony was arguably significant to the jury's determination of Defendant's guilt. Id. In other words, can we conclude that the judicial relief obtained by the State in the armed robbery conviction was arguably due to Meacham's testimony? See Standage, 114 Ariz. at 484, 562 P.2d at 364.[14]\n",
      "*184 Having reviewed the entire record of the armed robbery trial, it is clear that Meacham's testimony was an insignificant factor in obtaining a conviction in that trial. All four robbery victims separately identified Defendant from a photographic line-up. They also testified at trial. When Defendant was arrested for the armed robbery, he had four credit cards of one of the victims in his wallet. In his home police found a gun identified by one of the victims as the gun used in the robbery, as well as clothing similar to that worn by the perpetrator of the robbery. Defendant also had a police scanner on his person when arrested; the robbery victims noted that the robber had an identical police scanner with him at the time of the crime. The license plate of the car Defendant drove to the robbery matched that of Barker's car, and Meacham testified that Defendant had access to Barker's car. Meacham's testimony about Defendant's admission came in as an unresponsive answer to a single question and was never mentioned again in the examination of Meacham or any other witness. The prosecutor never referred to Defendant's alleged admission in his opening statement or closing argument.\n",
      "We conclude that Meacham's testimony about Defendant's inculpatory statement was at most an insignificant factor in light of the overwhelming evidence of Defendant's guilt on the armed robbery charge. Because judicial estoppel is to be invoked cautiously, on these facts we are unprepared to say that the prior position was successfully maintained. We therefore decline to invoke judicial estoppel here to preclude Meacham's testimony at the murder trial. Thus, we examine whether the prosecutor's actions constituted misconduct justifying reversal.\n",
      "2. Prosecutorial misconduct\n",
      "At oral argument before this court, the State conceded that the prosecutor elicited testimony of an admission about a single incident to help establish Defendant's guilt of two unrelated crimes. The prosecutor justified his actions by telling this court that he had been mistaken about presenting Defendant's admission at the robbery trial. As the murder investigation developed, the prosecutor became less convinced that Defendant's admission related to the armed robbery and more convinced that Defendant had been describing events of the murder. The State supported its use of Defendant's admission at the murder trial because it was made after the murder, better fit the facts of the murder,[15] and was therefore relevant evidence in the murder trial. The State submits it was for the jury to decide what weight to give Meacham's testimony. Further, the State argues that Defendant was free to ask Meacham questions that would have explained the alleged admission, thereby attributing the admission to the robbery rather than to the murder.\n",
      "Even accepting the prosecutor's assertion that he decided in good faith that the inculpatory statement referred to the murder charge, we believe it improper for the State to fail to first notify defense counsel and the court of its intent to use evidence in this manner. While the robbery conviction awaited review by the court of appeals, the prosecutor made no effort to inform that court or defense counsel that he believed the admission did not relate to the robbery but to the murder, and had been improperly admitted in the first trial and properly used in the second. Nor did the prosecutor raise the matter after affirmance of the robbery conviction by the court of appeals. State v. Towery, No. 1 CA-CR 92-0831, Mem. Dec. (Ct.App. filed Sept. 29, 1994). When Defendant petitioned us to review that case, the State did not inform this court that Defendant's robbery conviction may have been based in part on improperly admitted evidence. This court denied review on March 21, 1995. If Defendant's inculpatory statement referred to the murder case, as the State now argues, the prosecutor should have informed the court and Defendant that he had presented irrelevant evidence at the robbery trial. At the very least, the prosecutor *185 had a duty to give notice in one case or the other that the admission of a single incident had been used to help convict Defendant of unrelated charges. His failure to give notice in either case constitutes misconduct.\n",
      "Having concluded that the prosecutor's actions constituted misconduct, we consider whether Defendant suffered prejudice mandating a new trial. See Ariz. R.Crim. P. 24.1. We are not eager to reverse a conviction on grounds of prosecutorial misconduct as a method to deter such future conduct. See State v. Valdez, 160 Ariz. 9, 14, 770 P.2d 313, 318 (1989). Rather, absent structural error, we usually will not reverse if the error was harmless. Id. Error is harmless if we can conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that it did not contribute to or affect the verdict. State v. Bible, 175 Ariz. 549, 588, 600, 858 P.2d 1152, 1191, 1203 (1993), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 114 S.Ct. 1578, 128 L.Ed.2d 221 (1994). In the murder trial, even had defense counsel been aware of the prior use of Meacham's testimony, the State would probably have been permitted, over defense objection, to elicit the same testimony from Meacham by disavowing the relevance of the testimony in the armed robbery trial and placing the reviewing court on notice so it could be considered in Defendant's appeal of that conviction. See Ariz. R. Evid. 401, 403.\n",
      "Had defense counsel in the present case been aware of the prior inconsistent use of Meacham's testimony, however, he could have impeached Meacham with his prior testimony to raise doubts about whether the admission related to the murder. But after the prosecutor brought out Meacham's testimony in the murder trial, Defendant elicited the following from Meacham on cross-examination:\n",
      "Q. Do you know for sure that [he was] talking about Mr. Jones [the victim]?\n",
      "A. I thought [he was] talking about when [he] got busted before.\n",
      "Q. So, in fact, you didn't think [he was] talking about Mr. Jones?\n",
      "A. No, sir, I didn't.\n",
      "R.T., Aug. 11, 1992, at 40. On re-direct, the prosecutor tried to rehabilitate the witness by showing that for all Meacham knew, Defendant might have been discussing events of the murder, but he got no more than the following:\n",
      "Q. Okay. The conversation that you overheard, was it before or after all of this property came into the house?\n",
      "A. I believe it was after.\n",
      "Q. And you don't really know what the conversation that you heard pertains to, do you?\n",
      "A. No, sir.\n",
      "R.T., Aug. 11, 1992, at 41.\n",
      "Thus, both the defense attorney and the prosecutor elicited testimony indicating Meacham either believed Defendant admitted some crime other than the charged murder or was not sure what Defendant was admitting. Any impeachment defense counsel would have obtained from having known of the testimony in the prior trial was effectively achieved. Accordingly, we conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the prosecutor's misconduct did not affect the verdict. See Bible, 175 Ariz. at 588-90, 858 P.2d at 1191-93.\n",
      "Because the prosecutor's misconduct did not violate any of Defendant's constitutional rights resulting in reversible error, and because judicial estoppel would not preclude Meacham's testimony in the murder trial, Defendant has no remedy with respect to his murder conviction on this ground. Rather, when error that is harmless results from prosecutorial misconduct, the proper remedy is to report the offender to the state bar for possible sanctions, which we have done. Valdez, 160 Ariz. at 14, 770 P.2d at 318.\n",
      "Defendant also objects to the State's use of his statement at the sentencing hearing to prove the murder was committed in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner under A.R.S. § 13-703(F)(6). If Defendant's admission referred to an unrelated crime, it cannot be used to prove an aggravating factor for this crime. See Bible, 175 Ariz. at 604, 858 P.2d 1152 at 1207 (the special circumstances of cruelty, heinousness, or depravity apply to the defendant's actions during the offense). Although the trial judge *186 found beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was especially cruel, heinous, and depraved, the special verdict indicates that the judge did not rely on the disputed statement to prove this aggravator. Under these circumstances, we find no error.\n",
      "D. Admission of late evidence\n",
      "The State failed to timely disclose two pieces of evidence admitted by the trial judge: blood stains on a glove belonging to Defendant and fingerprints on a compact disk player case removed from Jones' car. Under Ariz. R.Crim. P. 15.1, the prosecutor should have disclosed this evidence, the names of the experts who examined it, and the reports or statements relating to it within ten days after Defendant's October 11, 1991 arraignment. The prosecutor did not disclose the fingerprint evidence until July 28, 1992 and the blood evidence until July 30, 1992, less than a week before trial began. Defendant moved to preclude this evidence on July 31. We note this was the only sanction Defendant requested; he did not ask for a continuance. Defendant contends the late disclosure and admission of this evidence deprived him of due process, requiring the verdict and sentence to be set aside.\n",
      "Rule 15.7 of the Arizona Rules of Criminal Procedure authorizes the trial court to sanction a party who does not timely disclose material relevant to the case. If a sanction is warranted, it should have a minimal effect on the evidence and merits of the case. State v. Smith, 140 Ariz. 355, 358-59, 681 P.2d 1374, 1377-78 (1984). Precluding evidence is rarely an appropriate sanction. State v. Fisher, 141 Ariz. 227, 246, 686 P.2d 750, 769, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1066, 105 S.Ct. 548, 83 L.Ed.2d 436 (1984); but see State v. Killean, 185 Ariz. 270, 915 P.2d 1225 (1996) (approving trial court's preclusion of corroborative documentation evidence when defense counsel failed to record existence of such evidence, willfully violating discovery rules). Denial of a sanction is generally not an abuse of discretion if the trial court believes the defendant will not be prejudiced. Id. Absent a showing of abuse by the trial court, we will not disturb the trial court's choice of sanction or its decision not to impose a sanction. State v. Tucker, 157 Ariz. 433, 439, 759 P.2d 579, 585 (1988).\n",
      "Before sanctioning the offering party, the court should consider (1) the importance of the evidence to the prosecutor's case, (2) surprise or prejudice to the defendant, (3) prosecutorial bad faith, and (4) other relevant circumstances. Smith, 140 Ariz. at 358-59, 681 P.2d at 1377-78.[16] Before admitting the evidence, the trial judge heard arguments from both sides and found no prejudice to Defendant from the late disclosure. After examining the four Smith factors, we agree with the trial judge's conclusion.\n",
      "First, the State conceded that the evidence was of little importance to its case. Neither the blood on the glove, which had not been analyzed for blood group type, nor the fingerprint found on the compact disk case removed from the Lincoln, provided a physical link to the murder. Next, because Defendant had been given timely notice of the identity of the State's latent print and blood experts, he should not have been surprised when they were called to testify about their findings. However, because neither the prosecutor nor the defense learned about the experts' findings until shortly before trial, Defendant could have been prejudiced had he been deprived of an opportunity to have his own experts study the evidence. When the trial judge asked Defendant how the late disclosure prejudiced him, he replied only that he was surprised by the experts' late reports. Thus, there is no indication of actual prejudice from the late disclosure. Further, Defendant offered no evidence of prosecutorial bad faith, and the trial judge found none. The prosecutor may be held accountable for the negligence of the State's blood expert, who waited until the last minute before *187 transmitting his nine-month-old report. See State v. Castaneda, 111 Ariz. 264, 266, 528 P.2d 608, 610 (1974) (prosecutor admonished for failing to use sufficient effort to keep apprised of the evidence). But because the defense's investigation of the evidence was not impaired by the State's delay, we find no prejudice to Defendant. In sum, the de minimis value of the evidence, Defendant's failure to show how its late disclosure hindered his defense, and the absence of prosecutorial misconduct on this issue lead us to conclude that the judge acted within her discretion in admitting the evidence without sanction.\n",
      "Defendant further contends that the blood evidence lacked relevance and should not have been admitted. The State's blood expert testified only to the existence of human blood on the glove, not to its type or any other information that might have shown Defendant had physical contact with Jones. Arguing the glove served only to inflame the jury, Defendant contends the judge erred by not weighing its probative value against its potential for unfair prejudice, as required by Ariz. R. Evid. 403 and State v. Chapple, 135 Ariz. 281, 288, 660 P.2d 1208, 1215 (1983) (\"the correct rule is that exhibits which may tend to inflame the jury must first be found relevant\"). The record indicates that the blood spot was unremarkable and could only be seen on close inspection of the glove. We find that the glove was not inflammatory. Although the evidence had little probative value, we find no error in admitting it.\n",
      "SENTENCING ISSUES\n",
      "When seeking the death penalty, the State must prove aggravating circumstances listed in A.R.S. § 13-703(F) beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Kiles, 175 Ariz. 358, 369, 857 P.2d 1212, 1223 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1058, 114 S.Ct. 724, 126 L.Ed.2d 688 (1994). Defendant has the burden of proving any statutory or non-statutory mitigating circumstances by a preponderance of the evidence. Id. at 373, 857 P.2d at 1227; A.R.S. § 13-703(G). The death penalty is required if at least one aggravating factor is found and the mitigating circumstances are not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency. A.R.S. § 13-703(E). This court conducts an independent review of the aggravating and mitigating factors in all capital cases to determine whether the death penalty is warranted. State v. Wood, 180 Ariz. 53, 68, 881 P.2d 1158, 1173 (1994).\n",
      "A. Aggravating circumstances\n",
      "1. The cruel, heinous, or depraved aggravating factor\n",
      "Defendant challenges the trial judge's finding that he committed the murder in an especially cruel, heinous, or depraved manner. A.R.S. § 13-703(F)(6). The judge determined that Jones was conscious until the second strangulation; she also found that ransacking Jones' house while he was bound, leaving him to agonize over his fate, sticking him several times with a hypodermic needle, and strangling him twice caused terror and horror in Jones' mind. The judge concluded that these events satisfied the meaning of cruelty under our case law. Special Verdict, Nov. 20, 1992, at 33-34. The judge also found that strangling rather than shooting the victim, leaving the victim's pants unzipped before laying him on his bed, attempting to inject an unidentified substance into him, and post-offense statements made to friends and roommates justifying and relishing the murder sufficiently demonstrated Defendant's depraved mental state and attitude, setting this case outside the usual first-degree murder. Id. at 34-35.\n",
      "Defendant argues that the judge's findings lack sufficient support. First, Defendant argues that the facts of this case do not support a finding of cruelty because they do not show beyond a reasonable doubt that Jones suffered mental anguish and terror. Defendant cites a number of cases describing circumstances this court has found to be especially cruel, claiming this case does not come close. Second, Defendant argues that the facts do not satisfy the Gretzler factors to support a finding of heinous and depraved. See State v. Gretzler, 135 Ariz. 42, 52, 659 P.2d 1, 11, cert. denied, 461 U.S. 971, 103 S.Ct. 2444, 77 L.Ed.2d 1327 (1983). We need not reach the heinous or depraved elements if we find cruelty beyond a reasonable doubt. Kiles, 175 Ariz. at 370, 857 P.2d at 1224 *188 (finding beyond a reasonable doubt any one of the three elements of § 13-703(F)(6) is sufficient to constitute an aggravating circumstance).\n",
      "We have held that:\n",
      "A murder is committed in an especially cruel manner if the perpetrator inflicts mental anguish or physical pain upon the victim before the victim's death. Mental anguish includes a victim's uncertainty about [his] ultimate fate.\n",
      "Id. at 371, 857 P.2d at 1213 (internal citations omitted). A finding of cruelty requires conclusive evidence that the victim was conscious and suffered mental or physical pain at the time of the offense. Bible, 175 Ariz. at 604, 858 P.2d at 1207.\n",
      "Barker testified that Jones did not struggle or appear to be breathing when Defendant strangled him the second time. Barker heard him gagging the first time he was strangled. The medical examiner testified that Jones could have been conscious while being strangled the second time, but he could offer no evidence of Jones' actual consciousness. Other evidence, however, convincingly shows that Jones suffered extreme mental and physical pain. He was conscious when the two men with a gun confronted him in his home, bound his hands behind his back, took him upstairs, asked him whether he wanted to be left tied or put to sleep, placed him face down on his bed, and pushed his head down while pulling on the tie to strangle him. He was conscious while Defendant stabbed his arms several times to inject a mystery substance. Defendant believed Jones was conscious after the injections because he heard Jones snoring, pretending to be asleep, even though Defendant had injected no sleeping medication. Jones was therefore conscious when he was strangled the first time. These events certainly caused Jones mental anguish about his fate, and the needle punctures and first strangulation caused him physical suffering. We find beyond a reasonable doubt that Defendant inflicted mental anguish and physical pain on the victim and that the murder was therefore committed in an especially cruel manner. Thus, the (F)(6) aggravating factor is satisfied, and we need not consider whether the murder was committed in an especially heinous or depraved manner.\n",
      "2. Other aggravators\n",
      "We also find ample support for the other aggravators. It is undisputed that Defendant was convicted of armed robbery, involving the threat of violence, while on parole, making him eligible for a life sentence. That conviction now makes him eligible for the death penalty. A.R.S. § 13-703(F)(1) and (2).\n",
      "Defendant also does not dispute that the murder was prompted by a desire for and an expectation of pecuniary gain. Killing for financial gain is an aggravating factor for imposing the death sentence. A.R.S. § 13-703(F)(5); State v. White, 168 Ariz. 500, 510-11, 815 P.2d 869, 879-80 (1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1105, 112 S.Ct. 1199, 117 L.Ed.2d 439 (1992). A pecuniary motive took Defendant to the victim's house and was the impetus for his other conduct during the ensuing robbery and killing. This qualifies him for the death penalty. State v. Fierro, 166 Ariz. 539, 551, 804 P.2d 72, 84 (1990).\n",
      "B. Mitigating circumstances\n",
      "We independently weigh the mitigating evidence against the aggravating circumstances to determine whether leniency is called for. State v. Barreras, 181 Ariz. 516, 520-21, 892 P.2d 852, 856-57 (1995).\n",
      "1. Defendant's abusive family background\n",
      "The trial judge considered evidence of Defendant's abusive family background and did not find mitigating value in it. Citing a line of Supreme Court cases[17] requiring courts to consider family history for independent mitigating weight, Defendant calls the judge's finding unconstitutional. Although the judge rejected the evidence as a mitigating factor because he failed to establish a nexus between his family background and his crime, *189 Defendant argues that the judge violated the law.\n",
      "Defendant misconstrues the Supreme Court cases culminating in Penry v. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989). They hold only that \"a sentencer may not be precluded from considering, and may not refuse to consider, any relevant mitigating evidence offered by the defendant as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" Id. at 318, 109 S.Ct. at 2946. Having considered family background during the penalty phase, the sentencer must give the evidence such weight that the sentence reflects a \"reasoned moral response\" to the evidence. Id. at 319, 109 S.Ct. at 2947. The sentencer therefore must consider the defendant's upbringing if proffered but is not required to give it significant mitigating weight. How much weight should be given proffered mitigating factors is a matter within the sound discretion of the sentencing judge. State v. Atwood, 171 Ariz. 576, 648, 832 P.2d 593, 665 (1992).\n",
      "We have held that a difficult family background is not always entitled to great weight as a mitigating circumstance. State v. Wallace, 160 Ariz. 424, 426-27, 773 P.2d 983, 985-86 (1989) (\"A difficult family background is a relevant mitigating circumstance if a defendant can show that something in that background had an effect or impact on his behavior that was beyond the defendant's control.\"), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1047, 110 S.Ct. 1513, 108 L.Ed.2d 649 (1990). We have since reaffirmed that family background may be a substantial mitigating circumstance when it is shown to have some connection with the defendant's offense-related conduct. White, 168 Ariz. at 512-13, 815 P.2d at 881-82.\n",
      "Defendant has failed to connect his family background to his criminal conduct. Defendant's sisters testified at the sentencing hearing that he was a small child with dyslexia and a bed-wetting problem and that he was physically and mentally abused by his overweight and diabetic mother. One sister related that his mother forced him to kneel in a box of rice when he complained that his leg hurt after falling from a wagon, and that she gagged him with a sock and bound his hands in the back of the car while on a family trip. These events, however, occurred when Defendant was young, years before he robbed and murdered at the age of 27. They do not prove a loss of impulse control or explain what caused him to kill. The trial judge considered this background and gave it little or no mitigating value. We do not disagree.\n",
      "2. Other mitigating circumstances\n",
      "The trial judge considered all the statutory mitigating factors under § 13-703(G) and gave them no weight. She found some mitigation in Defendant's drug use because it may have impaired his ability to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. She found Barker's disproportionate sentence in relation to Defendant's a mitigating circumstance and gave it significant weight. Nonetheless, she concluded that the mitigating evidence was not sufficiently substantial to require leniency, even if any combination of only two aggravating factors is affirmed by this court.\n",
      "We have examined the record for mitigating circumstances and find the rather sparse evidence insufficient to overcome the weight of the aggravating circumstances. We therefore affirm the death sentence.\n",
      "C. Summary issues\n",
      "To preserve issues, Defendant also raised the following arguments, which we summarily reject. See Atwood, 171 Ariz. at 645 n. 21, 832 P.2d at 662 n. 21.\n",
      "1. The equal protection clause requires sentencing by a jury\n",
      "This claim has no logical basis and has been rejected in State v. Landrigan, 176 Ariz. 1, 6, 859 P.2d 111, 116, cert. denied, 510 U.S. 927, 114 S.Ct. 334, 126 L.Ed.2d 279 (1993).\n",

      "As required by A.R.S. § 13-4035, we have searched the record for fundamental error and have found none.[18] Of the issues raised by Defendant on appeal, none requires reversal. We therefore affirm Defendant's first-degree murder conviction and the death sentence.\n",

      "[2]  Tina said she did not talk with Defendant again until February 9, when she visited him in prison. According to Tina, she learned from her friend Judy that Defendant was in prison. Judy had been visiting Defendant's cellmate, a man named Paul. While Judy visited Paul, she telephoned Tina and told her that Paul had a friend who wanted to meet her. Tina had previously visited and befriended inmates she did not know. When Defendant got on the telephone, he and Tina recognized each other. Thereafter, Tina visited Defendant in prison regularly.\n",

      "A: Because of  I used to have an old belief in the occult.\n",

Counsel explained that he had seen what looked like a satanic altar in a photograph of Barker's bedroom and wanted to ask Barker to confirm its identity. He continued, \"I think it's important that the jury know that he has some different type of beliefs that other people may not.\" The trial judge asked for case law showing that satanism was an exception to the rule prohibiting a party from introducing evidence of a witness' religious beliefs. Id. at 140-41. Counsel agreed to find authority but never offered any.\n",

      "(Emphasis added.)\n",
      "[9]  Defendant used plastic tie wraps, like the ones used during Jones' murder, during the armed robbery. He had also used a police scanner in the armed robbery. Barker told police that Defendant took a police scanner to Jones' house. The State wanted to call the armed robbery victim to prove the identity of Jones' killer and filed a motion to admit prior bad acts. The State later withdrew its motion.\n",
      "[10]  In Britt the Court upheld the trial court's decision not to provide a transcript to the defendant. The same judge presided, and the same counsel appeared. Because the same court reporter, who knew the attorneys and the judge, was present and could have readily provided defense counsel with transcriptions from the prior mistrial if informally asked, the Court found that the defendant had adequate alternative devices available. See State v. Tomlinson, 121 Ariz. 313, 589 P.2d 1345 (App. 1978) (reviewing state and federal cases on whether the defendant had an adequate alternative device for a trial transcript).\n",
      "[11]  We note that the transcript would have been of no value to Defendant insofar as it pertained to the testimony of two of the common witnesses. These witnesses were police officers who had been involved in the robbery and murder investigations. They testified at this trial only about items seized in the murder investigation. The robbery trial transcripts of these two witnesses would have been useless to the defense for discovery or impeachment purposes.\n",

      "[14]  Although Defendant supplemented his brief with the portion of the transcript of the armed robbery trial containing Meacham's examination, he did not provide this court with the entire transcript. We later ordered that the record of Defendant's prior armed robbery trial be produced in its entirety and included as part of this record.\n",
      "[15]  The prosecutor explained at oral argument that the oldest victim of the previous crime was 55 years old. Jones was 68 years old when he was murdered. Defendant's reference to an \"old man\" convinced the prosecutor that Defendant had been discussing Jones rather than the robbery victim when Meacham overheard him.\n",
      "[16]  These factors were enumerated in a case in which the defendant discovered an exculpatory witness during trial and moved to permit him to testify. Later cases have drawn on Smith when undisclosed witnesses have been called to testify. This case is somewhat different because the State's experts and the nature of their involvement were known to Defendant's counsel well before trial. Nonetheless, we find the Smith factors helpful to our analysis here.\n",

      "Well in advance of petitioner's state-court trial for attempted murder, the prosecutor filed a discovery motion requesting a list of defense witnesses.  Petitioner's answer failed to list one Wormley, as did his amended answer, submitted and accepted on the first day of trial, identifying two witnesses who were never called to testify.  On the second day of trial, after the prosecution's two principal witnesses had completed their testimony, petitioner's counsel made an oral motion to further amend the discovery answer to include Wormley.  Counsel explained that Wormley had probably seen the entire incident that led to the indictment and that, although petitioner had told counsel about Wormley earlier, counsel had been unable to locate Wormley.  At a subsequent voir dire examination, Wormley testified that he had not been a witness to the incident itself but had earlier seen the victim and his brother carrying guns and threatening petitioner and that he just happened to run into petitioner and warned him to watch out.  On cross-examination, Wormley acknowledged that he had first met petitioner over two years after the incident in question and that defense counsel had visited him at his home during the week before the trial began. As a sanction for the failure to identify Wormley in the discovery answer, the trial judge refused to allow Wormley to testify before the jury.  The judge explained that petitioner's counsel had committed a blatant and willful violation of the discovery rules and that the judge doubted the veracity of Wormley's testimony. The Illinois Appellate Court affirmed petitioner's conviction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment may, in an appropriate case, be violated by the imposition of a discovery sanction that entirely excludes the testimony of a material defense witness.  The Clause is not merely a guarantee that the accused shall have the power to subpoena witnesses, but confers on the accused the fundamental right to present witnesses in his own defense.  Pp. 407-409.\n",
      "2. However, the Compulsory Process Clause does not create an absolute bar to preclusion of the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for violating a discovery rule.  Although a trial court may not ignore the fundamental character of the defendant's right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor, the mere invocation of that right cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests.  If discovery violations are willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage or to conceal a plan to present fabricated testimony, it would be entirely appropriate to exclude the witnesses' testimony regardless of whether other, less drastic sanctions might be available, adequate, and merited.  Pp. 410-416.\n",
      "3. The exclusion of Wormley's testimony did not constitute constitutional error.  Pp. 416-418.\n",
      "(a) The fact that the voir dire examination of Wormley may have adequately protected the prosecution from prejudice resulting from surprise does not render the imposition of the preclusion sanction unnecessarily harsh.  The record raises strong inferences that petitioner's counsel was deliberately seeking a tactical advantage in failing to list Wormley as a witness and that \"witnesses [were] being found that really weren't there.\"  Thus, the case fits into the category of willful misconduct for which the severe sanction of preclusion is justified in order to protect the integrity of the judicial process.  P. 416—417.\n",
      "(b) It is not unfair to hold petitioner responsible for his lawyer's misconduct.  The lawyer necessarily has full authority to manage the conduct of the trial, and the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer's trial decisions.  Pp. 417—418.\n",

      "* A jury convicted petitioner in 1984 of attempting to murder Jack Bridges in a street fight on the south side of Chicago on August 6, 1981.  The conviction was supported by the testimony of Bridges, his brother, and three other witnesses.  They described a 20-minute argument between Bridges and a young man named Derrick Travis, and a violent encounter that occurred over an hour later between several friends of Travis, including petitioner, on the one hand, and Bridges, belatedly aided by his brother, on the other.  The incident was witnessed by 20 or 30 bystanders.  It is undisputed that at least three members of the group which included Travis and petitioner were carrying pipes and clubs that they used to beat Bridges.  Prosecution witnesses also testified that petitioner had a gun, that he shot Bridges in the back as he attempted to flee, and that, after Bridges fell, petitioner pointed the gun at Bridges' head but the weapon misfired.\n",

It developed that Wormley had not been a witness to the incident itself.  He testified that prior to the incident he saw Jack Bridges and his brother with two guns in a blanket, that he heard them say \"they were after Ray [petitioner] and the other people,\" and that on his way home he \"happened to run into Ray and them\" and warned them \"to watch out because they got weapons.\"8  On cross-examination, Wormley acknowledged that he had first met defendant \"about four months ago\" (i.e., over two years after the incident).  He also acknowledged that defense counsel had visited him at his home on the Wednesday of the week before the trial began.

      "In this Court petitioner makes two arguments.  He first contends that the Sixth Amendment bars a court from ever ordering the preclusion of defense evidence as a sanction for violating a discovery rule.  Alternatively, he contends that even if the right to present witnesses is not absolute, on the facts of this case the preclusion of Wormley's testimony was constitutional error. Before addressing these contentions, we consider the State's argument that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment is merely a guarantee that the accused shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and simply does not apply to rulings on the admissibility of evidence.9\n",

      "In the State's view, no Compulsory Process Clause concerns are even raised by authorizing preclusion as a discovery sanction, or by the application of the Illinois rule in this case.  The State's argument is supported by the plain language of the Clause, see n. 1, supra, by the historical evidence that it was intended to provide defendants with subpoena power that they lacked at common law,10 by some scholarly comment,11 and by a brief excerpt from the legislative history of the Clause.12  We have, however, consistently given the Clause the broader reading reflected in contemporaneous state constitutional provisions.13\n",

Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 56, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1000, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987).  Few rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense, see, e.g., Chambers v.

Just as an accused  has the right to confront the prosecution's witnesses for the  purpose of challenging their testimony, he has the right to  present his own witnesses to establish a defense.

The accused does not have an unfettered right to offer testimony that is incompetent, privileged, or otherwise inadmissible under standard rules of evidence.

Most other Sixth Amendment rights arise automatically on the initiation of the adversary process and no action by the defendant is necessary to make them active in his or her case.14  While those rights shield the defendant from potential prosecutorial abuses, the right to compel the presence and present the testimony of witnesses provides the defendant with a sword that may be employed to rebut the prosecution's case.  The decision whether to employ it in a particular case rests solely with the defendant.

The adversary process could not function effectively without adherence to rules of procedure that govern the orderly presentation of facts and arguments to provide each party with a fair opportunity to assemble and submit evidence to contradict or explain the opponent's case.  The trial process would be a shambles if either party had an absolute right to control the time and content of his witnesses' testimony.  Neither may insist on the right to interrupt the opposing party's case, and obviously there is no absolute right to interrupt the deliberations of the jury to present newly discovered evidence. The State's interest in the orderly conduct of a criminal trial is sufficient to justify the imposition and enforcement of firm, though not always inflexible, rules relating to the identification and presentation of evidence.15\n",

Nixon, 418 U.S., at 709, 94 S.Ct., at 3108.  Rules that provide for pretrial discovery of an opponent's witnesses serve the same high purpose.16  Discovery, like cross-examination, minimizes the risk that a judgment will be predicated on incomplete, misleading, or even deliberately fabricated testimony.  The \"State's interest in protecting itself against an eleventh-hour defense\"17 is merely one component of the broader public interest in a full and truthful disclosure of critical facts.\n",

Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975), we upheld an order excluding the testimony of an expert witness tendered by the defendant because he had refused to permit discovery of a \"highly relevant\" report.

      "\"The court's preclusion sanction was an entirely proper  method of assuring compliance with its order.  Respondent's  argument that this ruling deprived him of the Sixth Amendment  rights to compulsory process and cross-examination  misconceives the issue.  The District Court did not bar the  investigator's testimony.  Cf. Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S.  14, 19 [87 S.Ct. 1920, 1923, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019] (1967).  It  merely prevented respondent from presenting to the jury a  partial view of the credibility issue by adducing the  investigator's testimony and thereafter refusing to disclose  the contemporaneous report that might offer further critical  insights.  The Sixth Amendment does not confer the right to present testimony free from the legitimate demands  of the adversarial system;  one cannot invoke the Sixth  Amendment as a justification for presenting what might have  been a half-truth.  Deciding, as we do, that it was within  the court's discretion to assure that the jury would hear the  full testimony of the investigator rather than a truncated  portion favorable to respondent, we think it would be  artificial indeed to deprive the court of the power to  effectuate that judgment.  Nor do we find constitutional  significance in the fact that the court in this instance was  able to exclude the testimony in advance rather than receive  it in evidence and thereafter charge the jury to disregard it  when respondent's counsel refused, as he said he would, to  produce the report.\"  Id., at 241, 95 S.Ct., at 2171-2172  (emphasis added).\n",

He argues, correctly, that a less drastic sanction is always available.  Prejudice to the prosecution could be minimized by granting a continuance or a mistrial to provide time for further investigation;  moreover, further violations can be deterred by disciplinary sanctions against the defendant or defense counsel.\n",

One of the purposes of the discovery rule itself is to minimize the risk that fabricated testimony will be believed. Defendants who are willing to fabricate a defense may also be willing to fabricate excuses for failing to comply with a discovery requirement.  The risk of a contempt violation may seem trivial to a defendant facing the threat of imprisonment for a term of years.  A dishonest client can mislead an honest attorney, and there are occasions when an attorney assumes that the duty of loyalty to the client outweighs elementary obligations to the court.\n",

It is elementary, of course, that a trial court may not ignore the fundamental character of the defendant's right to offer the testimony of witnesses in his favor.  But the mere invocation of that right cannot automatically and invariably outweigh countervailing public interests.  The integrity of the adversary process, which depends both on the presentation of reliable evidence and the rejection of unreliable evidence, the interest in the fair and efficient administration of justice, and the potential prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial process must also weigh in the balance.19\n",

If that explanation reveals that the omission was willful and motivated by a desire to obtain a tactical advantage that would minimize the effectiveness of cross-examination and the ability to adduce rebuttal evidence, it would be entirely consistent with the purposes of the Compulsory Process Clause simply to exclude the witness' testimony.20  Cf.

      "The simplicity of compliance with the discovery rule is also relevant.  As we have noted, the Compulsory Process Clause cannot be invoked without the prior planning and affirmative conduct of the defendant.  Lawyers are accustomed to meeting deadlines. Routine preparation involves location and interrogation of potential witnesses and the serving of subpoenas on those whose testimony will be offered at trial.  The burden of identifying them in advance of trial adds little to these routine demands of trial preparation.21\n",

      "More is at stake than possible prejudice to the prosecution. We are also concerned with the impact of this kind of conduct on the integrity of the judicial process itself.  The trial judge found that the discovery violation in this case was both willful and blatant.22  In view of the fact that petitioner's counsel had actually interviewed Wormley during the week before the trial began and the further fact that he amended his Answer to Discovery on the first day of trial without identifying Wormley while he did identify two actual eyewitnesses whom he did not place on the stand, the inference that he was deliberately seeking a tactical advantage is inescapable.  Regardless of whether prejudice to the prosecution could have been avoided in this particular case, it is plain that the case fits into the category of willful misconduct in which the severest sanction is appropriate.  After all, the court, as well as the prosecutor, has a vital interest in protecting the trial process from the pollution of perjured testimony.  Evidentiary rules which apply to categories of inadmissible evidence—ranging from hearsay to the fruits of illegal searches—may properly be enforced even though the particular testimony being offered is not prejudicial.  The pretrial conduct revealed by the record in this case gives rise to a sufficiently strong inference that \"witnesses are being found that really weren't there,\" to justify the sanction of preclusion.23\n",

      "The argument that the client should not be held responsible for his lawyer's misconduct strikes at the heart of the attorney-client relationship.  Although there are basic rights that the attorney cannot waive without the fully informed and publicly acknowledged consent of the client,24 the lawyer has—and must have—full authority to manage the conduct of the trial.  The adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval.  Moreover, given the protections afforded by the attorney-client privilege and the fact that extreme cases may involve unscrupulous conduct by both the client and the lawyer, it would be highly impracticable to require an investigation into their relative responsibilities before applying the sanction of preclusion.  In responding to discovery, the client has a duty to be candid and forthcoming with the lawyer, and when the lawyer responds, he or she speaks for the client.  Putting to one side the exceptional cases in which counsel is ineffective, the client must accept the consequences of the lawyer's decision to forgo cross-examination, to decide not to put certain witnesses on the stand, or to decide not to disclose the identity of certain witnesses in advance of trial.  In this case, petitioner has no greater right to disavow his lawyer's decision to conceal Wormley's identity until after the trial had commenced than he has to disavow the decision to refrain from adducing testimony from the eyewitnesses who were identified in the Answer to Discovery.  Whenever a lawyer makes use of the sword provided by the Compulsory Process Clause, there is some risk that he may wound his own client.\n",

      "Criminal discovery is not a game.  It is integral to the quest for truth and the fair adjudication of guilt or innocence. Violations of discovery rules thus cannot go uncorrected or undeterred without undermining the truthseeking process.  The question in this case, however, is not whether discovery rules should be enforced but whether the need to correct and deter discovery violations requires a sanction that itself distorts the truthseeking process by excluding material evidence of innocence in a criminal case.  I conclude that, at least where a criminal defendant is not personally responsible for the discovery violation, alternative sanctions are not only adequate to correct and deter discovery violations but are far superior to the arbitrary and disproportionate penalty imposed by the preclusion sanction.  Because of this, and because the Court's balancing test creates a conflict of interest in every case involving a discovery violation, I would hold that, absent evidence of the defendant's personal involvement in a discovery violation, the Compulsory Process Clause per se bars discovery sanctions that exclude criminal defense evidence.\n",

The Appellate Court of Illinois stated that the only witness preclusion issue before it on appeal was whether \"the trial court abused its discretion by excluding the testimony of a defense witness as a sanction for violation of the discovery rules.\"  141 Ill.App.3d 839, 841, 96 Ill.Dec. 189, 190-191, 491 N.E.2d 3, 4-5 (1986).

This alone may not warrant the assumption that the Appellate Court implicitly held that a motion for new trial stating that \"the court erred\" preserved only an abuse of discretion claim and waived any constitutional claims.  But the Appellate Court of Illinois had already reached that holding in an identical case.  See People v. Douthit, 51 Ill.App.3d 751, 9 Ill.Dec. 439, 366 N.E.2d 950 (1977).

There is nothing in the record  to indicate that defense counsel ever raised any  constitutional objection during the extensive in-chambers  discussion summarized above, nor did he do so in his  post-trial motion, which requests a new trial solely on the  ground that '[t]he court erred in ruling that the defendant  could not call Glen Muench and Rocky Reed to testify to  defendant's state of intoxication at the time of the commission of the alleged burglary.'  As we read this  motion, it raises only the nonconstitutional question whether  the trial court abused its discretion in exercising the  exclusion sanction.  Failure to raise an issue, including a  constitutional issue, in the written motion for a new trial  constitutes waiver of that issue and it cannot be urged as a  ground for reversal on review.\"  Id., at 753-754, 9 Ill.Dec.,  at 441-442, 366 N.E.2d, at 952-953 (citations and footnotes  omitted;  emphasis added).\n",

Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 447, 85 S.Ct. 564, 567, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (1965).  Specifically, it is well established that where a state court possesses the power to disregard a procedural default in exceptional cases, the state court's failure to exercise that power in a particular case does not bar review in this Court.  Williams v. Georgia, 349 U.S. 375, 383-384, 75 S.Ct. 814, 819-820, 99 L.Ed. 1161 (1955);  see also Sullivan v.

The Illinois Supreme and Appellate Courts possess such a power.  Illinois Supreme Court Rule 615(a) provides:  \"Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed [on appeal] even though they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\"  Those courts frequently rely on this provision to address, in their discretion, issues that have been waived at trial.  See Jenner, Tone, & Martin, Historical and Practice Notes, following Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 110A, ¶ 615 (1985) (citing 16 appellate cases decided between 1979 and 1981 as examples of cases invoking plain error alone);  see also, e.g., People v.

Apparently, the Appellate Court below declined to exercise this discretion and deemed the waiver binding.  Since, under Williams v.

      "On the merits, I start from the same premise as the Court that the Compulsory Process Clause of the Sixth Amendment embodies a substantive right to present criminal defense evidence before a jury.  See ante, at 408-409;  see also, e.g., Pennsylvania v. Ritchie, 480 U.S. 39, 56, 107 S.Ct. 989, 1001, 94 L.Ed.2d 40 (1987).  Although I thus join the Court in rejecting the State's argument that the Clause embodies only the right to subpoena witnesses, I cannot agree with the Court's assertion that \"[t]he State's argument is supported by the plain language of the Clause.\"  Ante, at 407.  The Compulsory Process Clause provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.\"  This plain language supports the State's argument only if one assumes that the most natural reading of constitutional language is the least meaningful.  For the right to subpoena defense witnesses would be a hollow protection indeed if the government could simply refuse to allow subpoenaed defense witnesses to testify.  As this Court has recognized for the last 20 years, the right to subpoena witnesses must mean the right to subpoena them for a useful purpose, and thus necessarily implies a substantive limitation on the government's power to prevent those witnesses from testifying.\n",

      "The Compulsory Process and Due Process Clauses thus require courts to conduct a searching substantive inquiry whenever the government seeks to exclude criminal defense evidence.  After all, \"[f]ew rights are more fundamental than that of an accused to present witnesses in his own defense.\"  Chambers, supra, 410 U.S., at 302, 93 S.Ct., at 1049.  The exclusion of criminal defense evidence undermines the central truthseeking aim of our criminal justice system, see United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 3108, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974), because it deliberately distorts the record at the risk of misleading the jury into convicting an innocent person.  Surely the paramount value our criminal justice system places on acquitting the innocent, see, e.g., In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970), demands close scrutiny of any law preventing the jury from hearing evidence favorable to the defendant.  On the other hand, the Compulsory Process Clause does not invalidate every restriction on the presentation of evidence.  The Clause does not, for example, require criminal courts to admit evidence that is irrelevant, Crane, supra, 476 U.S., at 689-690, 106 S.Ct., at 2146, testimony by persons who are mentally infirm, see Washington v. Texas, supra, 388 U.S., at 23, 87 S.Ct., at 1925, n. 21, or evidence that represents a half-truth, see United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, 241, 95 S.Ct. 2160, 2171, 45 L.Ed.2d 141 (1975).

      "Accordingly, this Court has conducted searching substantive inquiries into the rationales underlying every challenged exclusion of criminal defense evidence that has come before it to date.  That scrutiny has led the Court to strike as constitutionally unjustifiable \"rules that prevent whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying on the basis of a priori categories that presume them unworthy of belief,\" such as a rule against introducing the testimony of an alleged accomplice, Washington v. Texas, supra, 388 U.S., at 22-23, 87 S.Ct., at 1925;  an application of the hearsay rule to statements that \"were originally made and subsequently offered at trial under circumstances that provided considerable assurance of their reliability,\" Chambers, supra, 410 U.S., at 300, 93 S.Ct., at 1048;  the exclusion of evidence bearing on the credibility of a voluntary confession, Crane, supra, 476 U.S., at 688-691, 106 S.Ct., at 2145-2147;  and a per se rule excluding all post-hypnosis testimony, Rock, supra, 483 U.S., at 56-62, 107 S.Ct., at 2711-2714.

      "The question at the heart of this case, then, is whether precluding a criminal defense witness from testifying bears an arbitrary and disproportionate relation to the purposes of discovery, at least absent any evidence that the defendant was personally responsible for the discovery violations.  This question is not answered by merely pointing out that discovery, like compulsory process, serves truthseeking interests.  Compare ante, at 411—412.  I would be the last to deny the utility of discovery in the truthseeking process.  See Brennan, The Criminal Prosecution:  Sporting Event or Quest for Truth?, 1963 Wash.U.L.Q. 279.  By aiding effective trial preparation, discovery helps develop a full account of the relevant facts, helps detect and expose attempts to falsify evidence, and prevents factors such as surprise from influencing the outcome at the expense of the merits of the case.  But these objectives are accomplished by compliance with the discovery rules, not by the exclusion of material evidence.  Discovery sanctions serve the objectives of discovery by correcting for the adverse effects of discovery violations and deterring future discovery violations from occurring.  If sanctions other than excluding evidence can sufficiently correct and deter discovery violations,2 then there is no reason to resort to a sanction that itself constitutes \"a conscious mandatory distortion of the fact-finding process whenever applied.\" Weinstein, Some Difficulties in Devising Rules for Determining Truth in Judicial Trials, 66 Colum.L.Rev. 223, 237 (1966).\n",

      "The use of the preclusion sanction as a corrective measure that is, as a measure for addressing the adverse impact a discovery violation might have on truthseeking in the case at hand is asserted to have two justifications:  (1) it bars the defendant from introducing testimony that has not been tested by discovery, see ante, at 411-413;  and (2) it screens out witnesses who are inherently suspect because they were not disclosed until trial, see ante, at 413-416.  The first justification has no bearing on this case because the defendant does not insist on a right to introduce a witness' testimony without giving the prosecution an opportunity for discovery.  He concedes that the trial court was within its authority in requiring the witness to testify first out of the presence of the jury, and he concedes that the trial court could have granted the prosecution a continuance to give it sufficient time to conduct further discovery concerning the witness and the proffered testimony.

      "In light of the availability of direct punitive measures, however, there is no good reason, at least absent evidence of the defendant's complicity, to countenance the arbitrary and disproportionate punishment imposed by the preclusion sanction. The central point to keep in mind is that witness preclusion operates as an effective deterrent only to the extent that it has a possible effect on the outcome of the trial.  Indeed, it employs in part the possibility that a distorted record will cause a jury to convict a defendant of a crime he did not commit.  Witness preclusion thus punishes discovery violations in a way that is both disproportionate—it might result in a defendant charged with a capital offense being convicted and receiving a death sentence he would not have received but for the discovery violation—and arbitrary—it might, in another case involving an identical discovery violation, result in a defendant suffering no change in verdict or, if charged with a lesser offense, being convicted and receiving a light or suspended sentence.

Nor did the trial court make any effort to determine whether the defendant bore any responsibility for the discovery violation.

Compare ante, at 413—414.  The threat of disciplinary proceedings, fines, or imprisonment will likely influence attorney behavior to a far greater extent than the rather indirect penalty threatened by evidentiary exclusion.  Such sanctions were available here. Rather than punishing the defendant under Rule 415(g)(i), the trial court could have sanctioned the attorney under Rule 415(g)(ii), which provides that \"Wilful violation by counsel of an applicable discovery rule . . . may subject counsel to appropriate sanctions by the court.\"  See also App. 28 (threatening disciplinary proceedings).  Direct sanctions against the attorney would have been particularly appropriate here since the discovery rule violated in this case places the obligation to comply with discovery not on the defendant, but directly on the attorney: providing that, upon motion by the State, a \"defense counsel . . . shall furnish the State with . . . the names and last known addresses of persons he intends to call as witnesses. . . .\" Ill.Sup.Ct.

But that is no explanation for allowing defense witness preclusion where there is no evidence that the defendant bore any responsibility for the discovery violation.  At a minimum, we would be obligated to remand for further factfinding to establish the defendant's responsibility. Deities may be able to visit the sins of the father on the son, but I cannot agree that courts should be permitted to visit the sins of the lawyer on the innocent client.\n",

      "\n",
      "77\n",
      "Nor is the issue resolved by analogizing to tactical errors an attorney might make such as failing to put witnesses on the stand that would have aided the defense.  Compare ante, at 410, 417—418.  Although we have sometimes held a defendant bound by tactical errors his attorney makes that fall short of ineffective assistance of counsel, we have not previously suggested that a client can be punished for an attorney's misconduct.  There are fundamental differences between attorney misconduct and tactical errors.  Tactical errors are products of a legitimate choice among tactical options.  Such tactical decisions must be made within the adversary system, and the system requires attorneys to make them, operating under the presumption that the attorney will choose the course most likely to benefit the defendant.  Although some of these decisions may later appear erroneous, penalizing attorneys for such miscalculations is generally an exercise in futility because the error is usually visible only in hindsight—at the time the tactical decision was made there was no obvious \"incorrect\" choice, and no prohibited one.  In other words, the adversary system often cannot effectively deter attorney's tactical errors and does not want to deter tactical decisions.  Thus, where a defense attorney makes a routine tactical decision not to introduce evidence at the proper time and the defense seeks to introduce the evidence later, deterrence measures may not be capable of preventing the untimely introduction of evidence from systemically disrupting trials, jury deliberations, or final verdicts.  In those circumstances, treating the failure to introduce evidence at the proper time as a procedural default that binds the defendant is arguably the only means of systemically preventing such disruption—not because binding the defendant deters tactical errors any better than direct punitive sanctions but because binding the defendant to defense counsel's procedural default, by definition, eliminates the disruption.  The actual operation of the adversary system generally bears out the analysis outlined above.  Direct punitive sanctions are not available to punish and deter routine tactical errors.  If, however, the erroneous nature of the attorney's decision was sufficiently evident at the time, then the system does want to deter the attorney's behavior, and can and does do so by directly sanctioning the attorney for malpractice.  It does not bind the defendant, who by establishing malpractice would have also established ineffective assistance of counsel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "78\n",
      "The rationales for binding defendants to attorneys' routine tactical errors do not apply to attorney misconduct.  An attorney is never faced with a legitimate choice that includes misconduct as an option.  Although it may be that \"[t]he adversary process could not function effectively if every tactical decision required client approval,\" ante, at 418, that concern is irrelevant here because a client has no authority to approve misconduct.  Further, misconduct is not visible only with hindsight, as are many tactical errors.  Consequently, misconduct is amenable to direct punitive sanctions against attorneys as a deterrent that can prevent attorneys from systemically engaging in misconduct that would disrupt the trial process.  There is no need to take steps that will inflict the punishment on the defendant.  Direct punitive sanctions are also more appropriate since the determination that misconduct occurred (and the level of penalty imposed) primarily turns on an assessment of the attorney's culpability rather than, as with procedural defaults, an assessment of the potential for disrupting the trial system.  In this case there is no doubt that willfully concealing the identity of witnesses one intends to call at trial is attorney misconduct, that the government seeks to deter such behavior in all instances, and that the attorney knows such behavior is misconduct and not a legitimate tactical decision at the time it occurs.  Direct punitive sanctions against the attorney are available.  See Rule 415(g)(ii).  And the decision to impose the evidentiary exclusion penalty in this case clearly turned on an assessment of the attorney's culpability.  See App. 25-28;  People v. Rayford, 43 Ill.App.3d 283, 286, 1 Ill.Dec. 941, 944, 356 N.E.2d 1274, 1277 (1976) (exclusion only justifiable if the discovery violation is deliberate).  No one contends that the same exclusion would have been justified if the failure to disclose Wormley's identity had been inadvertent.7\n",

      "In short, I can think of no scenario that does not involve a defendant's willful violation of a discovery rule where alternative sanctions would not fully vindicate the purposes of discovery without distorting the truthseeking process by excluding evidence of innocence.  Courts can couple corrective measures that will subject the testimony at issue to discovery and adverse credibility inferences with direct punitive measures that are both proportional to the discovery violation and directed at the actor responsible for it.  Accordingly, absent evidence that the defendant was responsible for the discovery violation, the exclusion of criminal defense evidence is arbitrary and disproportionate to the purposes of discovery and criminal justice and should be per se unconstitutional.  I thus cannot agree with the Court's case-by-case balancing approach or with its conclusion in this case that the exclusion was constitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "80\n",
      "The Court's balancing approach, moreover, has the unfortunate effect of creating a conflict of interest in every case involving a willful discovery violation because the defense counsel is placed in a position where the best argument he can make on behalf of his client is:  \"Don't preclude the defense witness—punish me personally.\"  In this very case, for example, the defense attorney became noticeably timid once the judge threatened to report his actions to the disciplinary commission.  App. 28-29.  He did not argue:  \"Sure, bring me before the disciplinary commission;  that's a much more appropriate sanction than excluding a witness who might get my client acquitted.\"  I cannot see how we can expect defense counsel in this or any other case to act as vigorous advocates for the interests of their clients when those interests are adverse to their own.8\n",

      "It seems particularly ironic that the Court should approve the exclusion of evidence in this case at a time when several of its Members have expressed serious misgivings about the evidentiary costs of exclusionary rules in other contexts.  Surely the deterrence of constitutional violations cannot be less important than the deterrence of discovery violations.  Nor can it be said that the evidentiary costs are more significant when they are imposed on the prosecution.  For that would turn on its head what Justice Harlan termed the \"fundamental value determination of our society that it is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.\"  In re Winship, 397 U.S., at 372, 90 S.Ct., at 1077 (concurring opinion).\n",

Nixon, 418 U.S., at 709, 94 S.Ct., at 3108, but is also arbitrary and disproportionate to any of the purposes served by discovery rules or discovery sanctions.

      " The State also argues that we should decline to exercise jurisdiction over petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim because it was inadequately presented in the state court.  As respondent points out, petitioner did not specifically articulate his claim as based on the Compulsory Process Clause until he filed a petition for rehearing in the Illinois Appellate Court.  Moreover, at trial petitioner merely argued that the trial court erred by not letting his witness testify.  On appeal, however, petitioner asserted that the error was constitutional:  \"The trial judge abused his discretion and denied [petitioner] due process by excluding a material defense witness from testifying as a sanction for a discovery violation.\"  Brief and Argument For Appellant in No. 84-1073 (App.Ct.Ill.), p. 28.  Although petitioner expressly asserted only a due process violation, his reliance on the Sixth Amendment was clear.  He cited and relied upon, through a quotation from an Illinois Appellate Court decision, two of our Compulsory Process Clause cases, Washington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14, 87 S.Ct. 1920, 18 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1967), and Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). The state-court decision from which petitioner quoted, People v. Rayford, 43 Ill.App.3d 283, 1 Ill.Dec. 941, 356 N.E.2d 1274 (1976), was also a Compulsory Process Clause case.  The court in Rayford asserted that use of the preclusion sanction in criminal cases should be limited to extreme situations because in criminal cases \"due process requires that a defendant be permitted to offer testimony of witnesses in his defense,\" id., at 286-287, 1 Ill.Dec., at 944, 356 N.E.2d, at 1277 (emphasis added), citing Washington, supra.\n",

Three states emphasized the right to present evidence, guaranteeing the accused the right 'to call for evidence in his favour.'  Two emphasized the subpoena power, giving the defendant the right to produce 'all proofs that may be favorable' to him.

Delaware emphasized the defendant's interest in sworn testimony, giving him the right 'to examine evidence on oath in his favour.'

      "Barcelona.com, Inc. (\"Bcom, Inc.\"), a Delaware corporation, commenced this action under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act against Excelentisimo Ayuntamiento de Barcelona (the City Council of Barcelona, Spain) for a declaratory judgment that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of the domain name <barcelona.com> is not unlawful under the Lanham Act (Chapter 22 of Title 15 of the United States Code). The district court concluded that Bcom, Inc.'s use of <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to Spanish trademarks owned by the City Council that include the word \"Barcelona.\" Also finding bad faith on the basis that Bcom, Inc. had attempted to sell the <barcelona.com> domain name to the City Council for a profit, the court ordered the transfer of the domain name to the City Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "Because the district court applied Spanish law rather than United States law and based its transfer order, in part, on a counterclaim that the City Council never filed, we reverse the judgment of the district court denying Bcom, Inc. relief under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, vacate its memorandum opinion and its order to transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

      "* In 1996, Mr. Joan Nogueras Cobo (\"Nogueras\"), a Spanish citizen, registered the domain name <barcelona.com> in the name of his wife, also a Spanish citizen, with the domain registrar, Network Solutions, Inc., in Herndon, Virginia. In the application for registration of the domain name, Nogueras listed himself as the administrative contact. When Nogueras met Mr. Shahab Hanif, a British citizen, in June 1999, they developed a business plan to turn <barcelona.com> into a tourist portal for the Barcelona, Spain, region. A few months later they formed Bcom, Inc. under Delaware law to own <barcelona.com> and to run the website, and Nogueras, his wife, and Hanif became Bcom, Inc.'s officers. Bcom, Inc. was formed as an American company in part because Nogueras believed that doing so would facilitate obtaining financing for the development of the website. Although Bcom, Inc. maintains a New York mailing address, it has no employees in the United States, does not own or lease office space in the United States, and does not have a telephone listing in the United States. Its computer server is in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "Shortly after Nogueras registered the domain name <barcelona.com> in 1996, he placed some Barcelona-related information on the site. The site offered commercial services such as domain registry and web hosting, but did not offer much due to the lack of financing. Before developing the business plan with Hanif, Nogueras used a web-form on the City Council's official website to e-mail the mayor of Barcelona, Spain, proposing to \"negotiate\" with the City Council for its acquisition of the domain name <barcelona.com>, but Nogueras received no response. And even after the development of a business plan and after speaking with potential investors, Nogueras was unable to secure financing to develop the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "In March 2000, about a year after Nogueras had e-mailed the Mayor, the City Council contacted Nogueras to learn more about Bcom, Inc. and its plans for the domain name <barcelona.com>. Nogueras and his marketing director met with City Council representatives, and after the meeting, sent them the business plan that was developed for Bcom, Inc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6\n",
      "On May 3, 2000, a lawyer for the City Council sent a letter to Nogueras demanding that Nogueras transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council. The City Council owned about 150 trademarks issued in Spain, the majority of which included the word Barcelona, such as \"Teatre Barcelona,\" \"Barcelona Informacio I Grafic,\" and \"Barcelona Informacio 010 El Tlefon Que Ho Contesta Tot.\" Its earlier effort in 1995 to register the domain name <barcelona.es>, however, was unsuccessful. The City Council's representative explained, \"It was denied to Barcelona and to all place names in Spain.\" This representative also explained that the City Council did not try also to register <barcelona.com> in 1995 even though that domain name was available because \"[a]t that time ... the world Internet that we know now was just beginning and it was not seen as a priority by the City Council.\" The City Council now took the position with Bcom, Inc. that its domain name <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to numerous trademarks that the City Council owned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "A couple of days after the City Council sent its letter, Nogueras had the domain name <barcelona.com> transferred from his wife's name to Bcom, Inc., which he had neglected to do in 1999 when Bcom, Inc. was formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Upon Bcom, Inc.'s refusal to transfer <barcelona.com> to the City Council, the City Council invoked the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\"UDRP\") promulgated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\") to resolve the dispute. Every domain name issued by Network Solutions, Inc. is issued under a contract, the terms of which include a provision requiring resolution of disputes through the UDRP. In accordance with that policy, the City Council filed an administrative complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (\"WIPO\"), an ICANN-authorized dispute-resolution provider located in Switzerland. The complaint sought transfer of the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council and relied on Spanish law in asserting that Bcom, Inc. had no rights to the domain name while the City Council had numerous Spanish trademarks that contained the word \"Barcelona.\" As part of its complaint, the City Council agreed \"to be subject to the jurisdiction of the registrant[']s residence, the Courts of Virginia (United States), only with respect to any challenge that may be made by the Respondent to a decision by the Administrative Panel to transfer or cancel the domain names that are [the] subject of this complaint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "The administrative complaint was resolved by a single WIPO panelist who issued a ruling in favor of the City Council on August 4, 2000. The WIPO panelist concluded that <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to the City Council's Spanish trademarks, that Bcom, Inc. had no legitimate interest in <barcelona.com>, and that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> was in bad faith. To support his conclusion that Bcom, Inc. acted in bad faith, the WIPO panelist observed that the only purpose of the business plan was \"to commercially exploit information about the City of Barcelona... particularly ... the information prepared and provided by [the City Council] as part of its public service.\" The WIPO panelist ordered that Bcom, Inc. transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "In accordance with the UDRP's provision that required a party aggrieved by the dispute resolution process to file any court challenge within ten business days, Bcom, Inc. commenced this action on August 18, 2000 under the provision of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (the \"ACPA\") that authorizes a domain name owner to seek recovery or restoration of its domain name when a trademark owner has overstepped its authority in causing the domain name to be suspended, disabled, or transferred. See 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Bcom, Inc.'s complaint sought a declaratory judgment that its use of the name <barcelona.com> \"does not infringe upon any trademark of defendant or cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the website <barcelona.com>;... [and] that [the City Council] is barred from instituting any action against [Bcom, Inc.] for trademark infringement.\" While the City Council answered the complaint and stated, as an affirmative defense, that the court lacked jurisdiction over the City Council for any cause of action other than Bcom, Inc.'s \"challenge to the arbitrator's Order issued in the UDRP domain name arbitration proceeding,\" the City Council filed no counterclaim to assert any trademark rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11\n",
      "Following a bench trial, the district court entered a memorandum opinion and an order dated February 22, 2002, denying Bcom, Inc.'s request for declaratory judgment and directing Bcom, Inc. to \"transfer the domain name barcelona.com to the [City Council] forthwith.\" 189 F.Supp.2d 367, 377 (E.D.Va.2002). Although the district court concluded that the WIPO panel ruling \"should be given no weight and this case must be decided based on the evidence presented before the Court,\" the court proceeded in essence to apply the WIPO panelist opinion as well as Spanish law. Id. at 371. The court explained that even though the City Council did not own a trademark in the name \"Barcelona\" alone, it owned numerous Spanish trademarks that included the word Barcelona, which could, under Spanish law as understood by the district court, be enforced against an infringing use such as <barcelona.com>. Id. Adopting the WIPO panelist's decision, the court stated that \"the WIPO decision was correct in its determination that [Bcom, Inc.] took `advantage of the normal confusion' of an Internet user by using the `Barcelona route' because an Internet userwould `normally expect to reach some official body ... for ... the information.'\" Id. at 372. Referring to the facts that Bcom, Inc. engaged in little activity and attempted to sell the domain name to the City Council, the court concluded that \"these factors clearly demonstrate a bad faith intent on the part of the Plaintiff and its sole shareholders to improperly profit from their registration of the domain name barcelona.com.\" At bottom, the court concluded that Bcom, Inc. failed to demonstrate, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v), that its use of <barcelona.com> was \"not unlawful.\" Id. at 373.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "In addition to concluding that Bcom, Inc. failed to establish its claim, the court stated that it was also deciding the City Council's counterclaim for relief under 15 U.S.C. § 1125 and determined that \"the Spanish trademark `Barcelona' is valid for purposes of the ACPA.\" Id. at 374. Applying the factors of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(2)(d)(1)(B)(i), the court found that Nogueras and his wife acted with \"bad faith intent\" in registering <barcelona.com> as a domain name. Id. at 374-76. The court also found that <barcelona.com> \"is confusingly similar to the defendant's mark.\" Id. at 376.\n",

      "16\n",
      "[T]rial courts may consider rights in foreign trademarks which were asserted in the transfer decision under review. The [WIPO] administrative transfer proceeding itself gives the district court both subject matter and personal jurisdiction; jurisdiction is not dependent upon allegations of U.S. trademark rights. Therefore, failure to consider the basis for the administrative decision would remove the basis for jurisdiction, and require dismissal of the case. The statute language does not limit the marks considered to U.S. marks.\n",

      "Apparently, the City Council does not dispute these jurisdictional observations as far as they go. It contends, however, that jurisdiction to hear a claim under § 1114(2)(D)(v) rests on a recognition of the WIPO proceeding and the law that the WIPO panelist applied. Although we agree with the City Council that the WIPO proceeding is relevant to a claim under § 1114(2)(D)(v), it is not jurisdictional; indeed, the WIPO panelist's decision is not even entitled to deference on the merits.

      "A domain name is \"any alphanumeric designation which is registered with or assigned by any domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1127. To obtain a domain name, a would-be registrant simply makes application to a registrar (there are currently over 160), submits a fee, and agrees to the terms of the domain name registration agreement. Domain names are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.\n",

      "It also provides a contractually mandated process, the UDRP, for resolution of disputes that might arise between domain name registrants and trademark owners. The UDRP is intended to provide a quick process for resolving domain name disputes by submitting them to authorized panels or panel members operating under rules of procedure established by ICANN and under \"any rules and principles of law that [the panel] deems applicable.\" ICANN, Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, ¶ 15(a), at http:// www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm (Oct. 24, 1999).\n",

      "Because the administrative process prescribed by the UDRP is \"adjudication lite\" as a result of its streamlined nature and its loose rules regarding applicable law, the UDRP itself contemplates judicial intervention, which can occur before, during, or after the UDRP's dispute-resolution process is invoked. See ICANN, UDRP ¶ 3(b), at http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm (Oct. 24, 1999) (stating that the registrar will cancel or transfer the domain name upon the registrar's \"receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action\"); id. at ¶ 4(k) (\"The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded\"); id. (providing that the registrar will stay implementation of the administrative panel's decision if the registrant commences \"a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted\" under the applicable UDRP rule of procedure). As ICANN recognized in designing the UDRP, allowing recourse to full-blown adjudication under a particular nation's law is necessary to prevent abuse of the UDRP process. See id. at ¶ 1 (defining \"reverse domain name hijacking\" as use of the UDRP \"in bad faith to attempt to deprive a registered domain-name holder of a domain name\"). Thus, when a person obtains a domain name, the person agrees, in the registration contract with the registrar, to follow the UDRP as established by ICANN.\n",

No. 106-113, § 3001 et seq., 113 Stat. 1501A-545 (codified in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C.), principally for the purpose of protecting trademark owners against cyberpiracy:\n",

      "S. Rep. No. 106-140, at 4 (1999). Although the ACPA was enacted primarily to redress cyberpiracy or \"cybersquatting,\" it also provides limited liability for trademark infringement by registrars who participate in the administration of the registration, transfer, and cancellation of domain names pursuant to a \"reasonable policy\" that is consistent with the purposes of the trademark laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(i)-(iii). And to balance the rights given to trademark owners against cybersquatters, the ACPA also provides some protection to domain name registrants against \"overreaching trademark owners.\" S.Rep. No. 106-140, at 11; see also 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(iv)-(v). Thus, § 1114(2)(D)(v) authorizes a domain name registrant to sue trademark owners for \"reverse domain name hijacking.\"1 Under that reverse domain name hijacking provision, a domain name registrant who is aggrieved by an overreaching trademark owner may commence an action to declare that the domain name registration or use by the registrant is not unlawful under the Lanham Act. This section provides that the court may \"grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v).\n",

      "In sum, domain names are issued pursuant to contractual arrangements under which the registrant agrees to a dispute resolution process, the UDRP, which is designed to resolve a large number of disputes involving domain names, but this process is not intended to interfere with or modify any \"independent resolution\" by a court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, the UDRP makes no effort at unifying the law of trademarks among the nations served by the Internet. Rather, it forms part of a contractual policy developed by ICANN for use by registrars in administering the issuance and transfer of domain names. Indeed, it explicitly anticipates that judicial proceedings will continue under various nations' laws applicable to the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34\n",
      "The ACPA recognizes the UDRP only insofar as it constitutes a part of a policy followed by registrars in administering domain names, and the UDRP is relevant to actions brought under the ACPA in two contexts. First, the ACPA limits the liability of a registrar in respect to registering, transferring, disabling, or cancelling a domain name if it is done in the \"implementation of a reasonable policy\" (including the UDRP) that prohibits registration of a domain name \"identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another's mark.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). Second, the ACPA authorizes a suit by a domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled or transferred under that reasonable policy (including the UDRP) to seek a declaration that the registrant's registration and use of the domain name involves no violation of the Lanham Act as well as an injunction returning the domain name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35\n",
      "Thus, while a decision by an ICANN-recognized panel might be a condition of, indeed the reason for, bringing an action under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v), its recognition vel non is not jurisdictional. Jurisdiction to hear trademark matters is conferred on federal courts by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338, and a claim brought under the ACPA, which amended the Lanham Act, is a trademark matter over which federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "Moreover, any decision made by a panel under the UDRP is no more than an agreed-upon administration that is not given any deference under the ACPA. To the contrary, because a UDRP decision is susceptible of being grounded on principles foreign or hostile to American law, the ACPA authorizes reversing a panel decision if such a result is called for by application of the Lanham Act.\n",

Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 373-74 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) requires the federal court to approach the issues raised in an action brought under that provision de novo rather than to apply the deferential review appropriate to actions governed by the Federal Arbitration Act); Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA, 273 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining that \"a federal court's interpretation of the ACPA supplants a WIPO panel's interpretation of the UDRP\").

      "A domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled, or transferred under a policy described under clause (ii)(II) may, upon notice to the mark owner, file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.

      "15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Thus, to establish a right to relief against an \"overreaching trademark owner\" under this reverse hijacking provision, a plaintiff must establish (1) that it is a domain name registrant; (2) that its domain name was suspended, disabled, or transferred under a policy implemented by a registrar as described in 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II); (3) that the owner of the mark that prompted the domain name to be suspended, disabled, or transferred has notice of the action by service or otherwise; and (4) that the plaintiff's registration or use of the domain name is not unlawful under the Lanham Act, as amended.\n",
      "\n",

      "The parties do not dispute that the first two elements are satisfied. Bcom, Inc. is a domain name registrant, and its domain name was suspended, disabled, or transferred under Network Solutions' policy, i.e., the UDRP incorporated into the domain name registration agreement for <barcelona.com>. Although the domain name had not actually been transferred from Bcom, Inc. as of the time that Bcom, Inc. commenced this action, the WIPO panelist had already ordered the transfer, and as a result of this order the transfer was certain to occur absent the filing of this action to stop it. By filing this suit, Bcom, Inc. obtained an automatic stay of the transfer order by virtue of paragraph 4(k) of the UDRP, which provides that the registrar will stay implementation of the administrative panel's decision if the registrant commences \"a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted\" under the applicable UDRP rule of procedure. See ICANN, UDRP ¶ 4(k). Moreover, this suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under § 1114(2)(D)(v) appears to be precisely the mechanism designed by Congress to empower a party whose domain name is subject to a transfer order like the one in the present case to prevent the order from being implemented. See Sallen, 273 F.3d at 25 n. 11 (\"We think that § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II), the statutory provision referenced in § 1114(2)(D)(v), covers situations where a transfer by [the registrar] is inevitable unless a court action is filed\").\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45\n",
      "It appears from the district court's memorandum opinion that it indeed did resolve the last element by applying Spanish law. Although the district court recognized that the City Council did not have a registered trademark in the name \"Barcelona\" alone, either in Spain or in the United States, it observed that \"[u]nder Spanish law, when trademarks consisting of two or more words contain one word that stands out in a predominant manner, that dominant word must be given decisive relevance.\" Barcelona.com, Inc., 189 F.Supp.2d at 371-72. The court noted that \"the term `Barcelona' has been included in many trademarks consisting of two or more words owned by the City Council of Barcelona. In most of these marks, the word `Barcelona' is clearly the dominant word which characterizes the mark.\" Id. at 372. These observations regarding the substance and effect of Spanish law led the court to conclude that the City Council of Barcelona \"owns a legally valid Spanish trademark for the dominant word `Barcelona.'\" Id. The district court then proceeded to determine whether Bcom's \"use of the Barcelona trademark is `not unlawful.'\" Id. In this portion of its analysis, the district court determined that there was a \"confusing similarity between the barcelona.com domain name and the marks held by the Council,\" id., and that \"the circumstances surrounding the incorporation of [Bcom, Inc.] and the actions taken by Nogueras in attempting to sell the domain name evidence[d] a bad faith intent to profit from the registration of a domain name containing the Council's mark,\" id. Applying Spanish trademark law in this manner, the court resolved that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> were unlawful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "It requires little discussion to demonstrate that this use of Spanish law by the district court was erroneous under the plain terms of the statute. The text of the ACPA explicitly requires application of the Lanham Act, not foreign law, to resolve an action brought under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Specifically, it authorizes an aggrieved domain name registrant to \"file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) (emphasis added).2 It is thus readily apparent that the cause of action created by Congress in this portion of the ACPA requires the court adjudicating such an action to determine whether the registration or use of the domain name violates the Lanham Act. Because the statutory language has a plain and unambiguous meaning that is consistent with the statutory context and application of this language in accordance with its plain meaning provides a component of a coherent statutory scheme, our statutory analysis need proceed no further. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (\"Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent\" (quotation marks omitted)).\n",

      "By requiring application of United States trademark law to this action brought in a United States court by a United States corporation involving a domain name administered by a United States registrar, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) is consistent with the fundamental doctrine of territoriality upon which our trademark law is presently based. Both the United States and Spain have long adhered to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. See Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883 (the \"Paris Convention\"), opened for signature Mar. 20, 1883, 25 Stat. 1372, as amended at Stockholm, opened for signature July 14, 1967, 21 U.S.T. 1583. Section 44 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1126, incorporates the Paris Convention into United States law, but only \"to provide foreign nationals with rights under United States law which are coextensive with the substantive provisions of the treaty involved.\" Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 958 F.2d 594, 597 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Int'l Cafe, S.A.L. v. Hard Rock Cafe Int'l (U.S.A.), Inc., 252 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (\"[T]he rights articulated in the Paris Convention do not exceed the rights conferred by the Lanham Act\"). The relevant substantive provision in this case is Article 6(3) of the Paris Convention, which implements the doctrine of territoriality by providing that \"[a] mark duly registered in a country of the [Paris] Union shall be regarded as independent of marks registered in the other countries of the Union, including the country of origin.\" Paris Convention, supra, art. 6(3). As one distinguished commentary explains, \"the Paris Convention creates nothing that even remotely resembles a `world mark' or an `international registration.' Rather, it recognizes the principle of the territoriality of trademarks [in the sense that] a mark exists only under the laws of each sovereign nation.\" 4 J.

      "48\n",
      "It follows from incorporation of the doctrine of territoriality into United States law through Section 44 of the Lanham Act that United States courts do not entertain actions seeking to enforce trademark rights that exist only under foreign law. See Person's Co., Ltd. v. Christman, 900 F.2d 1565, 1568-69 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\"The concept of territoriality is basic to trademark law; trademark rights exist in each country solely according to that country's statutory scheme\"). Yet the district court's application of foreign law in this declaratory judgment action did precisely this and thereby neglected to apply United States law as required by the statute.\n",

      "49\n",
      "When we apply the Lanham Act, not Spanish law, in determining whether Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> is unlawful, the ineluctable conclusion follows that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of the name \"Barcelona\" is not unlawful. Under the Lanham Act, and apparently even under Spanish law, the City Council could not obtain a trademark interest in a purely descriptive geographical designation that refers only to the City of Barcelona. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(2); see also Spanish Trademark Law of 1988, Art. 11(1)(c) (forbidding registration of marks consisting exclusively of \"geographical origin\"). Under United States trademark law, a geographic designation can obtain trademark protection if that designation acquires secondary meaning. See, e.g., Resorts of Pinehurst, Inc. v. Pinehurst Nat'l Corp., 148 F.3d 417, 421 (4th Cir.1998). On the record in this case, however, there was no evidence that the public — in the United States or elsewhere — associates \"Barcelona\" with anything other than the City itself. Indeed, the Chief Director of the City Council submitted an affidavit stating that \"[t]he City does not own and is not using any trademarks in the United States, to identify any goods or services.\" Therefore, under United States trademark law, \"Barcelona\" should have been treated as a purely descriptive geographical term entitled to no trademark protection. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(2). It follows then that there was nothing unlawful about Nogueras' registration of <barcelona.com>, nor is there anything unlawful under United States trademark law about Bcom, Inc.'s continued use of that domain name.3\n",

      "Retail Services, Inc. and Freebie, Inc. (collectively \"RSI\") brought this action for declaratory relief against Freebies Publishing, Eugene F. Zannon, and Gail Zannon (collectively \"defendants\") seeking an order declaring that RSI's use of the domain name <freebie.com> did not violate the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1) (West Supp.2003), that RSI's use of the term \"freebie\" in its domain name did not infringe upon defendants' registered FREEBIES trademark under the Lanham Act, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1114 (West 1997 & Supp.2003), and that the term \"freebies\" is generic and therefore not protectable as a trademark. In response, defendants filed a counterclaim under the Lanham Act based on RSI's use of the word \"freebie\" in its domain name, asserting claims for trademark infringement and cybersquatting. Additionally, defendants included Lanham Act claims for unfair competition and trademark dilution. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a), (c) (West 1998 & Supp.2003). Defendants also alleged that RSI's <freebie.com> domain name violated section 18.2-500 of the Virginia Code.\n",

      "The district court concluded that the word \"freebies\" is generic and not registrable as a federal trademark. Without a valid trademark before it, the court then awarded summary judgment to RSI on all claims and counterclaims. The district court also addressed sua sponte RSI's claim for attorneys' fees and costs that RSI raised in its complaint but did not pursue as part of its summary judgment motion. Finding that defendants harbored no fraudulent intent or bad faith in asserting the counterclaims and that no \"exceptional\" circumstances otherwise existed, the district court denied RSI's claim for attorneys' fees. 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a) (West Supp.2003).\n",

      "Before we recount the facts of this case, a brief discussion of the legal context in which the facts arise is helpful. Trademarks \"identify and distinguish\" goods produced by one person \"from those manufactured or sold by others and ... indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127 (West Supp.2003). To the purchasing public, a trademark \"signif[ies] that all goods bearing the trademark\" originated from the same source and \"that all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of quality.\" 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 3.2 (4th ed.2003) [hereinafter McCarthy]. Because of its role in assuring consumers of the origin and quality of the associated goods, a trademark is also \"a prime instrument in advertising and selling the goods.\" Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Thus, a proposed mark cannot acquire trademark protection unless the mark is distinctive, that is, unless it serves the traditional trademark functions of \"distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of others\" and identifying the source of the goods. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052 (West 1997). The antithesis of a distinctive mark is a \"generic\" mark which merely employs \"the common name of a product or service,\" Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 464 (4th Cir.1996), or \"refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species,\" Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). Because a generic mark, by definition, neither signifies the source of goods nor distinguishes the particular product from other products on the market, a generic term cannot be protected as a trademark nor registered as one. See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753; Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464; Larsen v. Terk Techs. Corp., 151 F.3d 140, 148 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that \"`generic marks' are accorded no protection at all....\"). \"The concepts of `generic name' and `trademark' are mutually exclusive\" because a generic term \"can never function as a mark to identify and distinguish the products of only one seller.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:1. From a policy standpoint, of course, if a business were permitted to appropriate a generic word as its trademark, it would be \"difficult for competitors to market their own brands of the same product. Imagine being forbidden to describe a Chevrolet as a `car' or an `automobile' because Ford or Chrysler or Volvo had trademarked these generic words.\" Blau Plumbing, Inc. v. S.O.S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F.2d 604, 609 (7th Cir.1986).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Whether trademark protection extends to a proposed mark is tied to the mark's distinctiveness. See Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464. In determining the distinctiveness of a given mark, courts use a categorical approach, placing the mark in one of four classifications that increase in distinctiveness as follows: generic, descriptive, suggestive, and arbitrary or fanciful. See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984). On the opposite end of the spectrum from the generic category are marks that are fanciful or arbitrary — inherently distinctive marks. Fanciful marks are, for the most part, nonsense \"words expressly coined for serving as a trademark.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (offering \"Clorox®, Kodak®, Polaroid®, and Exxon®\" as examples). Arbitrary marks consist of recognizable words used in connection with products for which \"they do not suggest or describe any quality, ingredient, or characteristic,\" as if the trademark was \"arbitrarily assigned.\" Id. (citing \"Camel® cigarettes\" and \"Apple® computers\" as examples).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "Between the generic and the arbitrary or fanciful categories are descriptive marks and suggestive marks, which are often difficult to distinguish from each other. Descriptive marks \"merely describe a function, use, characteristic, size, or intended purpose of the product.\" Id. (mentioning \"After Tan post-tanning lotion\" and \"5 Minute Glue\"). Descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive; the Lanham Act \"accord[s] protection only if they have acquired a `secondary meaning.'\" Larsen, 151 F.3d at 148; see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052(e)(1) (registration may be refused if the proposed mark, \"when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant[,] is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them\"). Saying that a trademark has acquired \"secondary meaning\" is shorthand for saying that a descriptive mark has become sufficiently distinctive to establish \"a mental association in buyers' minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product.\" 2 McCarthy at § 15:5; see Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753 (\"This acquired distinctiveness\" necessary for a descriptive mark to be protected \"is generally called `secondary meaning.'\"); Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (explaining that \"secondary meaning\" exists when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "In contrast to descriptive marks, suggestive marks are inherently distinctive and, like arbitrary or fanciful marks, qualify for registration without any showing of \"secondary meaning.\" See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. A mark is suggestive if it \"connote[s], without describing, some quality, ingredient, or characteristic of the product.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (providing the following examples: \"Coppertone®, Orange Crush®, and Playboy®\"). A helpful rule of thumb is that \"`if the mark imparts information directly, it is descriptive,'\" but \"`[i]f it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods, it is suggestive.'\" Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1528 (quoting Union Carbide Corp. v. Ever-Ready, Inc., 531 F.2d 366, 379 (7th Cir.1976)).\n",

      "In 1979, the Zannons purchased the right to publish Freebies Magazine, a periodical providing information about free mail-order offerings. The Zannons also acquired ownership rights to the stylized trademark FREEBIES, which the previous publisher registered in 1978 to use as a logo for the magazine. Apparently, the Zannons abandoned this particular mark for a period of time beginning in June 1985; however, in March 1992, the Zannons filed an application, on behalf of Freebies Publishing, with the PTO for a new certificate of registration for a different rendition of the stylized FREEBIES mark. Although the PTO eventually issued a certificate of registration for the mark, the application process was not without difficulty. The PTO's examining attorney initially refused the application because, among other reasons, \"the proposed mark merely describes the goods ... [t]he mark describes the subject matter of applicant's publication.\" J.A. 145. Freebies Publishing submitted a response but was unable to convince the PTO that the proposed FREEBIES trademark was suggestive rather than merely descriptive.\n",

      "In December 1992, having received no evidence demonstrating that defendants' mark had \"acquired secondary meaning,\" J.A. 140, the PTO finalized its refusal of registration. This refusal was withdrawn, however, after Eugene Zannon filed an affidavit under 37 C.F.R. § 2.41(b), which allows the PTO to accept as evidence of distinctiveness a declaration that the proposed mark has been in \"substantially exclusive and continuous use in commerce ... by [the] applicant for ... five years.\" Thus, the FREEBIES mark was finally registered on November 30, 1993, for use in connection with \"periodicals; namely, magazines and newspapers with information about mail order offerings.\" J.A. 96.\n",

When a customer makes a purchase from an RSI client, the RSI product enables information to be sent from the point of sale to RSI's database of customer transactions. The system then instantaneously identifies a potential \"incentive offer,\" described by RSI as \"a freebie,\" which is printed out and presented to the customer along with the purchase receipt.

      "In 1991, between the time that the defendants abandoned the original FREEBIES trademark and applied for the new registration, RSI received legal advice that the term \"freebie\" was available for use and could be legally protected. RSI took no further action, however, until 1995, when it registered the domain name <freebie.com> for later use, two years before defendants registered the <freebies.com> domain name. By that time, of course, FREEBIES was a registered trademark.\n",

In order to service the Blockbuster account, Frank Byerley, RSI's owner, formed Freebie, Inc., drawing the corporate name from a promotional scheme for Blockbuster customers to earn \"Freebie Points\" which they could cash in for rent-free viewing. In August 2001, RSI began operating its website at <www.freebie.com> so that Blockbuster customers could manage their Freebie Points online. Meanwhile, defendants had been offering their mail-order information online at <www.freebies.com> for five months.\n",

      "In December 2001, defendants demanded that RSI cease using the word \"freebie\" in connection with its business. RSI refused to do so, believing the word \"freebies\" to be generic in nature, not entitled to trademark protection, and free for public use. Defendants initiated an arbitration proceeding against RSI pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\"UDRP\"), which is incorporated into all domain-name registration agreements pursuant to which a second-level domain name is issued to a member of the public. The UDRP requires the registrant to submit disputes concerning the domain name to an approved dispute resolution provider — in this case the National Arbitration Forum — for the purpose of what is essentially non-binding arbitration. See Dluhos v. Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 372-73 (3d Cir.2003) (\"UDRP proceedings do not fall under the Federal Arbitration Act... [and] judicial review of those decisions is not restricted to a motion to vacate arbitration award under § 10 of the FAA, which applies only to binding proceedings likely to `realistically settle the dispute.'\"). The arbitrator concluded that <freebie.com> was confusingly similar to defendants' registered trademark and that RSI had no trademark rights in the name freebie. Additionally, the arbitrator determined that RSI registered the domain name in bad faith because it used the plural term \"freebies\" as a metatag for its website, which directed an Internet search for \"freebies\" to RSI's site.1 The arbitrator was persuaded that this evidence demonstrated RSI's awareness of defendants' FREEBIES trademark and, therefore, bad faith in acquiring its domain name. Accordingly, RSI was ordered to transfer the domain name <freebie.com> to defendants.\n",

      "RSI responded by filing this action against defendants for a declaration that RSI's use of the word \"freebie\" as part of its domain name does not violate the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d), and does not constitute trademark infringement, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1114(1)(a), trademark dilution, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(c), or unfair competition, see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a). RSI also asked the district court to rule that the word \"freebies\" is generic and to cancel the FREEBIES registration, rendering the arbitration order null and void. Defendants counterclaimed for trademark infringement and dilution, cybersquatting, and violations of Virginia law.\n",

      "The district court granted summary judgment to RSI, concluding that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrated the generic nature of the word \"freebies.\" See Retail Servs., Inc. v. Freebies Publishing, 247 F.Supp.2d 822, 825-27 (E.D.Va.2003). The court rejected the same argument defendants now offer on appeal — that summary judgment was inappropriate because an issue of fact existed by virtue of the PTO's registration of the FREEBIES mark, which is prima facie evidence that the mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection. Defendants also argued unsuccessfully that, even though use of the word \"freebie\" is now widespread, the FREEBIES mark was entitled to protection because the defendants did not use the word in the generic sense.

See U.S. Search, LLC v. U.S. Search.com, Inc., 300 F.3d 517, 522 (4th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is to be entered when, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); see U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 522. In light of the district court's holding, the relevant inquiry here is \"whether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).

      "Under the Lanham Act, the issuance of a certificate of registration arms the registrant with \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1057(b) (West 1997). Because the PTO may not register a generic mark, the fact that a mark is registered is strong evidence that the mark satisfies the statutory requirements for the distinctiveness necessary for trademark protection. See 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1052(e), 1057(b); 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3) (West 1997). The certificate of registration supplies \"the registrant [with] ... prima facie evidence that its mark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public ... and that its mark ... at a minimum is descriptive and has obtained secondary meaning.\" America Online, Inc. v. AT & T Corp., 243 F.3d 812, 816 (4th Cir.2001); see U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 524. This is a significant procedural advantage for the registrant. Without a certificate of registration, the owner would be required to establish that the disputed mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection in the first place. See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. The effect of the presumption is to satisfy that burden in the absence of rebutting evidence. See America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; see also Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d 778, 783 (9th Cir.2002) (\"In trademark terms, the registration is not absolute but subject to rebuttal\" and \"discharges the plaintiff's original common law burden of proving validity in an infringement action.\").\n",

      "24\n",
      "The presumption of validity flowing from trademark registration, therefore, has a burden-shifting effect, requiring the party challenging a registered mark to produce sufficient evidence to establish that the mark is generic by a preponderance of evidence. See Glover v. Ampak, Inc., 74 F.3d 57, 59 (4th Cir.1996); Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. The burden shifted by the presumption is one of production rather than persuasion. See Fed.R.Evid. 301 (\"In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.\"). If sufficient evidence of genericness is produced to rebut the presumption, the presumption is \"neutralize[d]\" and essentially drops from the case, although the evidence giving rise to the presumption remains. America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (\"[A]lthough the presumption of discrimination `drops out of the picture' once the defendant meets its burden of production ... the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's prima facie case....\").\n",

      "Relying on our decision in America Online, defendants contend that summary judgment in an infringement action on the basis that a registered trademark is or has become generic is never appropriate. Defendants argue that America Online established a rule in this circuit that the issuance of a certificate of registration is, by itself, sufficient to create a jury issue on the validity of the mark in question because it embodies the PTO's informed opinion that the mark is registrable. We disagree.\n",

      "In America Online, we considered the question of whether, in a federal trademark infringement action, a district court should afford Chevron-type deference to the PTO's determination that a given mark is registrable (and, by definition, not generic). In rejecting the application of Chevron deference, we explained that the PTO's \"decision to register a mark, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, [is] powerful evidence that the registered mark is suggestive\" and that a district court should \"receiv[e] the certificate of registration ... into evidence and treat [it] as prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark.\" 243 F.3d at 817-18. Although we concluded that \"the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration was in this case sufficient to establish a question of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment,\" id. at 818, we nowhere suggested that registration created a per se issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The panel in America Online carefully noted that the registration was sufficient \"in this case\" to preclude summary judgment, and that, in addition to the certificate of registration, there was \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. Id. at 818 (first emphasis added).2 The latter observation, of course, would be pointless if, as defendants argue, America Online held that a certificate of registration alone settles the matter of summary judgment. At most, America Online suggests that, as a general rule, the introduction of a certificate of registration will create enough of an factual dispute to render summary judgment inappropriate on the basis that the mark is generic. See U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 524 (\"The prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration is generally sufficient to establish a question of material fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\").

Additionally, the evidence must demonstrate the generic understanding of the mark from the viewpoint of the \"`relevant public.'\" Id. (quoting 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3)).

      "The district court considered various dictionary definitions that were roughly uniform in defining \"freebie\" as a slang term meaning \"`something ... given or received without charge.'\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 826 (quoting Webster's Ninth Collegiate Dictionary 491 (1988)); see, e.g., The American Heritage College Dictionary 542 (3d ed.1997) (\"An article or service given free.\"); Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 504 (1988) (\"Something given or received gratis....\"); Cambridge International Dictionary of English, Online Edition, available at http://dictionary.cambridge.org (\"[S]omething which is given to you without you having to pay for it, esp. as a way of attracting your support for or interest in something.\"). The district court noted that, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, \"freebie\" has been understood to mean \"`something that is provided free'\" since its 1942 inclusion \"in The American Thesaurus of Slang: A Complete Reference Book of Colloquial Speech.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 826-27. Although not controlling, \"dictionary definitions are relevant and sometimes persuasive\" on the issue of genericness \"based upon the assumption that dictionary definitions usually reflect the public's perception of a word's meaning and its contemporary usage.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12.13 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Harley-Davidson, Inc. v. Grottanelli, 164 F.3d 806, 810 (2nd Cir.1999) (\"[D]ictionary definitions of a word to denote a category of products are significant evidence of genericness.\"); Mil-Mar Shoe Co. v.

The district court highlighted the contents of defendants' own <freebies.com> website, which undercut their position that \"freebies\" is not a generic term. See Retail Servs. Inc., 247 F.Supp.2d at 827. For example, the < freebies.com> home page included a banner announcing that the website was \"BRINGING YOU THE BEST FREE AND ALMOST FREE OFFERS SINCE 1977\" and stating that \"Freebies.com is the best place on the web for free and almost free offers that you won't find anywhere else.\" J.A. 1382. The stylized freebies logo at the top of the home page appeared above the same slogan that had been emblazoned on the printed version of Freebies Magazine: \"The Magazine with Something for Nothing.\" J.A. 238; 1382.\n",

      "The actual offers included on <freebies.com> or in Freebies Magazine used the term \"freebies\" in this same sense — items that the reader would ordinarily expect to pay for but could obtain for free with the information provided by the magazine or website. For example, the September-October 1983 edition of Freebies Magazine included a section entitled \"Football Freebies\" which explained how to obtain \"fabulous freebies offered by your own special team.\" J.A. 267. The section was divided into two columns. One column, under the heading TEAM, listed addresses for various National Football League franchises, and the other column, under the heading FREEBIE, listed items that could be obtained for no cost (such as bumper stickers or posters) upon request. Likewise, on the website, typical items might include American flag lapel pins or tie tacks, like those offered on January 9, 2003, which could be obtained by sending the specified postage and handling costs to the address provided by <freebies.comm>. Gail and Eugene Zannon, moreover, both gave deposition testimony confirming that their use of the term \"freebies\" was consistent with the commonly understood meaning of the word, referring to free goods and services, and that their primary business is \"the distribution of [information about] free or almost free goods and services.\" J.A. 447; 537.\n",

Typical of these domain names are <weeklyfreebie.com>, which compiles categorized lists of \"freebie\" products and where to get them, J.A. 1174; <coolfreebielinks.com>, which uses a banner announcing \"Freebies, free stuff, giveaways... call them what you want, they all break down to the same thing ... getting something for nothing,\" J.A. 1154; <freebies24x7.com>, which \"offers one of the Web's largest collection of freebies.... If it's freebies you want, then it's freebies you got.... so put away your wallet and grab some Freebies!\" J.A. 1258; and < freebiedirectory.com>, the domain name for a website describing itself as \"Your searchable source for FREEBIES\" and providing information about a wide variety of free products and services. J.A. 1152.

      "Defendants' website, and those listed above, are but a few of the 1,600-plus websites (or more) that incorporate the word \"freebie\" or \"freebies\" into their domain names. These websites are now so common that the term \"freebie site\" is often used by these sites to refer to other sites that, like defendants, offer information about free products or services.3 In addition to this voluminous information pulled directly from these websites, the record contains declarations from competitor sites. Glenda McGarity, the owner of a website called \"Killer Freebies & Deals,\" <killerfreebies.com>, understands \"the word `freebies' to refer to free or almost free goods and services,\" supplies \"information about freebies offered by other individuals or companies,\" and is aware of many such Internet businesses that offer freebies. J.A. 626. Likewise, Lee Seats, who operates About.com's section on the topic of freebies, <freebies.about.com>, uses \"freebies\" on his website \"to refer to free or almost free goods and services\" and is \"in the business of providing information, tips and advice about how to obtain free or almost free goods and services (i.e., freebies) offered by other companies or individuals.\" J.A. 629.

      "1. Additional Evidence that \"Freebies\" Is Not Generic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "Defendants contend that the district court failed to take into consideration any of their evidence, in addition to the certificate of registration, that created an issue of fact by demonstrating the distinctive, non-generic nature of the mark. First, defendants point out that in reviewing defendants' application for trademark registration, the PTO's examining attorney considered one of the same dictionary definitions of \"freebie\" that the district court found persuasive on the issue of genericness. Defendants argue the fact that the PTO ultimately issued the certificate of registration seriously undercuts the value of the dictionary definition. This is not additional evidence; it is part and parcel of the certificate of registration which, as we explained at length, is itself evidence the word or phrase in question is not generic. We fail to see how this part of the registration process offers anything that the whole does not. The district court, of course, took the registration into account and acknowledged its presumptive effect, but simply concluded it was not enough to prevent summary judgment for RSI. See Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 826.4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "Defendants also contend that the district court all but ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the registered term was not only not generic, but was a strong, commercially successful mark with a well-established secondary meaning. In particular, defendants high-light that <freebies.com> receives an average of \"100,000 visits per month from consumers around the world,\" J.A. 712; that Freebies Magazine in print form had millions of paying subscribers; and that defendants sold more than 385,000 books offering information similar to that provided in Freebies Magazine. Evidence of an acquired secondary meaning, however, has no relevance unless the mark in question has been found not to be generic. See, e.g., Home Builders Ass'n of Greater St. Louis v. L & L Exhibition Mgmt., Inc., 226 F.3d 944, 949 (8th Cir.2000) (\"A `generic' mark is the common name of a product or service.... It may not be registered nor used exclusively by one competitor, even if it has acquired secondary meaning.\"); A & H Sportswear, Inc. v. Victoria's Secret Stores, Inc., 237 F.3d 198, 222 (3rd Cir.2000) (same).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "For these same reasons, we also discount defendants' reliance on the evidence of actual and potential confusion — according to defendants, for example, there were several hundred complaints from consumers who were seeking defendants' website but ended up in RSI's site, or vice-versa. Evidence establishing a likelihood of confusion simply \"do[es] not bear upon the question of whether [a] trademark ... [is] generic.\" Ale House Mgmt., Inc. v. Raleigh Ale House, Inc., 205 F.3d 137, 144-45 (4th Cir.2000). In sum, defendant has failed to highlight any significant evidence, outside of the certificate of trademark registration, that would create a genuine issue of fact on genericness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41\n",
      "2. Non-Generic Use of \"Freebies\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42\n",
      "Defendants contend that, even if the word \"freebies\" is generic, they were not using this term generically in connection with their business, which defendants carefully describe as the provision of \"information about no-cost or low cost promotional offers.\" J.A. 412. Defendants emphasize that they do not actually distribute or offer the free products or samples, which they concede would constitute a generic use of \"freebies,\" but simply tell consumers how to obtain such items from others, which they claim does not. In essence, defendants argue that this distinction transforms their use of FREEBIES from generic to descriptive.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "In our view, this razor-thin distinction is not significant. Of course, it is certainly possible for a term to serve as a generic description for one category of products but function as a distinctive mark for unrelated products in a different context. See, e.g., In re Seats, Inc., 757 F.2d 274, 277 (Fed.Cir.1985) (holding that the word \"SEATS\" was not generic for ticket reservations services even though it could not be registered in connection with chairs or couches). Even though defendants do not directly distribute free products or \"freebies,\" their business nonetheless revolves around \"freebies\" in the generic sense of the word. As defendants' website proclaims, they are \"BRINGING YOU THE BEST FREE AND ALMOST FREE OFFERS SINCE 1977!\"5 J.A. 1382. Accordingly, we reject defendants' contention that they were not using the term in its generic sense.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The Incontestable Status of FREEBIES\n",
      "\n",
      "44\n",
      "Defendants suggest that, even if we do not agree that FREEBIES is, at the very least, a descriptive mark that has acquired secondary meaning, it is beyond dispute that FREEBIES has become incontestable, and therefore is not subject to challenge with regard to its secondary meaning. This argument misses the mark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45\n",
      "If a registered trademark becomes incontestable, the rebuttable presumption that a registered mark has acquired secondary meaning becomes \"conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark\" subject to a number of affirmative defenses enumerated in the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C.A § 1115(b) (West 1998 & Supp.2003). This list, however, does not include a defense based upon a mark's lack of secondary meaning — a merely descriptive mark, then, is subject to challenge based on its lack of distinctiveness until it acquires incontestable status. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. Thus, a presumption arises from the registration of a trademark that the mark is entitled to trademark protection because of either the mark's inherently distinctive nature or its secondary meaning, but the mark is subject to challenge on the basis that it is merely descriptive. See id.; America Online, 243 F.3d at 817-18. The validity of the same registered mark, after qualifying for incontestable status, is conclusively presumed and may not be challenged as merely descriptive. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. The Supreme Court provided this concise summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "A mark that is merely descriptive of an applicant's goods or services is not registrable unless the mark has secondary meaning. Before a mark achieves incontestable status, registration provides prima facie evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark in commerce. The Lanham Act expressly provides that before a mark becomes incontestable an opposing party may prove any ... defense which might have been asserted if the mark had not been registered ... [including a] challenge [to the] mark as merely descriptive.... With respect to incontestable marks, ... registration is conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark.... Mere descriptiveness is not recognized by [the relevant provisions of the Lanham Act] as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark.\n",

      "Id. (internal citations omitted).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "Here, however, the issue is not whether the mark is merely descriptive, but whether it is generic. And incontestability is never a shield for a mark that is generic. Although § 1115(b) does not enumerate the generic nature of a trademark as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark, a registration is subject to cancellation at any time \"if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services ... for which it is registered.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3). As we observed before, a generic word can never function as a trademark or receive a certificate of registration as one. Even an incontestable mark, therefore, comes within the reach of § 1064(3) and may be canceled if it becomes generic. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 658.\n",

      "4. Stylized Lettering in the FREEBIES Trademark\n",
      "\n",
      "49\n",
      "Finally, defendants contend that, separate and apart from their rights in the word FREEBIES, the stylized rendering of the letters is sufficiently distinctive to merit registration. Assuming the registered display of FREEBIES is distinctive (which is far from clear), that fact does not aid defendants — \"such a registration does not give any exclusive right to use the generic word per se\" — \"[t]he only exclusive right from such a `picture' registration is the use of that exact `picture' which happens to spell out a generic name.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:40 (citing Time, Inc. v. Petersen Pub. Co., 173 F.3d 113 (2nd Cir.1999)). We have no difficulty concluding that the modest stylized lettering of the FREEBIES mark in no way affords defendants ownership rights in the generic word \"freebies.\" And, defendants do not guide us to anything in the record to suggest that the stylized rendition of the word is \"so distinctive as to create a commercial impression separate and apart from the [generic] term.\" In re Northland Aluminum Prods., Inc., 777 F.2d 1556, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court properly rejected this argument.\n",

      "Under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), the owner of a protected mark has a cause of action \"against anyone who registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to [the owner's] trademark with the bad faith intent to profit from the good will associated with the trademark.\" Hawes v. Network Solutions, Inc., 337 F.3d 377, 383 (4th Cir.2003); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1). The district court concluded that because it \"found defendants' trademark ineligible for protection, there can be no ACPA violation.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 827. Nevertheless, the court also analyzed whether RSI had violated the ACPA as if the FREEBIES mark were not generic, concluding that \"there was insufficient evidence... in this record to sustain a finding that [RSI] registered the domain name in bad faith.\" Id. at 828. We need go no farther than the district court's initial conclusion that defendants cannot state a claim under the ACPA without a valid trademark. This conclusion is compelled from the statutory language.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "51\n",
      "In pertinent part, the ACPA provides that \"[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark,... if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person ... (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark ... and (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that ... is identical or confusingly similar to that mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Under the statute, the term \"mark\" includes \"trademark,\" which is defined as \"identify[ing] and distinguish[ing] [the owner's] goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127. As we noted before, a generic term cannot function as a trademark; in fact, to say \"generic mark\" is to utter an oxymoron. \"By definition, something that is generic cannot serve as a trademark because it cannot function as an indication of source.\" Sunrise Jewelry Mfg. Corp. v. Fred S.A., 175 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1999). Thus, a prerequisite for bringing a claim under the ACPA is establishing the existence of a valid trademark and ownership of that mark. As we have already determined that \"freebies\" is generic and not entitled to trademark protection, defendants cannot surmount this threshold barrier. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment against defendants on their cybersquatting counterclaim, and its declaration that RSI's \"use of the domain name www.freebie.com does not violate the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.\n",

      "RSI cross-appeals the district court's sua sponte dismissal of its request for costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. RSI asserted this claim in its complaint for declaratory relief; it has not yet filed a separate motion for fees and did not seek a ruling on costs and fees as part of its summary judgment motion. Nevertheless, the district court disposed of this question sua sponte, without the benefit of briefing or oral argument. The court held that the case did not satisfy the \"exceptional\" requirement for an award of fees, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a), and that an award of costs was inappropriate as well because \"no violation of a registered trademark has been established.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.

The statute does not define what qualifies as an \"exceptional case.\" Like many, if not most, of our sister circuits, we define the \"exceptional case\" as one in which \"the defendant's conduct was malicious, fraudulent, willful or deliberate in nature.\" PETA, 263 F.3d at 370 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., Horphag Research, Ltd. v. Pellegrini, 337 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir.2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1111, 124 S.Ct. 1090, 157 L.Ed.2d 900 (2004); Tamko Roofing Prods., Inc. v. Ideal Roofing Co., 294 F.3d 227, 229 (1st Cir.2002); Planetary Motion, Inc. v. Techsplosion, Inc., 261 F.3d 1188, 1205 (11th Cir.2001); United Phosphorus Ltd. v.

We depart from a number of other courts, however, once the analysis moves beyond the general definition of an \"exceptional case.\" This circuit imposes a dual standard of proof upon prevailing plaintiffs and defendants. A prevailing plaintiff seeking attorney fees must demonstrate \"that the defendant acted in bad faith.\" Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 958 F.2d 594, 599 (4th Cir.1992); PETA, 263 F.3d at 370.6 However, when an alleged infringer is the prevailing party, he can qualify for an award of attorney fees upon a showing of \"something less than bad faith\" by the plaintiff. Scotch Whisky, 958 F.2d at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que Restaurant, 771 F.2d 521, 526 (1985).7 Some pertinent considerations for judging a plaintiff's (or counterclaim plaintiff's) conduct when the defendant prevails include \"economic coercion, groundless arguments, and failure to cite controlling law.\" Ale House Mgmt., 205 F.3d at 144 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).

      "The district court cited two factors in support of its conclusion that RSI, having won on the trademark counterclaims, could not satisfy the lesser showing required of a prevailing defendant: (1) the favor-able arbitration decision by the UDRP panelist, tending to show defendants' good faith in filing its counterclaims; and (2) the certificate of registration, also tending to support a good faith belief in the propriety of the counterclaims.

RSI does not challenge the conclusion that defendants had a subjective, good faith belief that their trademark claims were viable.

      "The question, however, is not whether snippets of the record or isolated arguments clearly lack merit.

We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that this is not an \"exceptional case\" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a). Moreover, we see nothing in the district court's order to indicate that it ignored the objective aspect of the positions taken by defendants during this case. Furthermore, although it may have been preferable for the district court to solicit input from the parties at a separate hearing on this issue, RSI could have sought to alter or amend the judgment on the question of attorney fees under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which also may have resulted in a more detailed analysis from the district court. RSI chose not to do so, an understandable tactical choice in light of the fact it had just achieved an unqualified victory on the merits. In this case, we will not disturb the district court's decision, which is also the correct one, solely because it was entered sua sponte when RSI opted not to seize its opportunity to raise its concerns below via Rule 59(e).

      "\n",
      "FACTS\n",
      "On March 30, 2005, plaintiff Helen Pittman, an African-American woman, filed a complaint in Multnomah County Circuit Court alleging employment discrimination *1067 on the basis of race and naming as defendants the State of Oregon Employment Department and Deborah Lincoln, Director of the Employment Department. Pittman brought her claim against the Employment Department under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, and her claim against Lincoln under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. In her complaint, Pittman alleged that the Employment Department is \"an administrative agency and a subdivision of the State of Oregon that does business in Mutlnomah [sic] County.\"\n",
      "On April 12, 2005, defendants removed the case to federal court and then moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). In their motion to dismiss, defendants argued that there is no right of action to sue a state under either § 1981 or § 1983, and that a state, \"regardless, is immune from such suits under the 11th Amendment to the United States Constitution.\"[1]\n",
      "On August 8, 2005, the district court issued an opinion and order in which it granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. Addressing Pittman's § 1983 claim, the district court noted that states are not \"persons\" for purposes of § 1983, so Pittman could not proceed under that statute against the Employment Department. Turning to Pittman's § 1981 claim, the district court held that the State of Oregon waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity by removing the case to federal court, but agreed that § 1981 does not permit actions against a state, citing the Supreme Court's decision in Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, 491 U.S. 701, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989). Pittman then filed this appeal, contesting only the district court's dismissal of her § 1981 action against the Employment Department.\n",
      "\n",
      "ANALYSIS\n",
      "Under this circuit's case law, § 1981 contains a right of action against municipalities. Fed'n of African Am. Contractors v. City of Oakland, 96 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir.1996). The plaintiff maintains that Federation should be extended to permit a § 1981 cause of action against a state, while the State contends otherwise. After surveying the statutory language and history in light of governing case law, we must agree.\n",
      "A. We begin by recounting the historical background of the issue before us. Prior to the amendments brought about by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Pub.L. No. 102-166, 105 Stat. 1071, 42 U.S.C. § 1981 provided:\n",
      "All persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall have the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts, to sue, be parties, give evidence, and to the full and equal benefit of all laws and proceedings for the security of persons and property as is enjoyed by white citizens, and shall be subject to like punishment, pains, penalties, taxes, licenses, and exactions of every kind, and to no other.\n",
      "The Supreme Court has interpreted this language to prohibit racial discrimination by both private parties and state entities in the making and enforcement of contracts. See Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 168-171, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); Patterson v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 186, 109 S.Ct. 2363, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989) (concluding that Title VII burden-shifting framework applied to claims of discrimination by private employers under § 1981) (superseded on other grounds by the Civil Rights Act of 1991). *1068 Cf. Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., 392 U.S. 409, 441-43, 88 S.Ct. 2186, 20 L.Ed.2d 1189 (1968) (holding that in enacting § 1982  which, like § 1981, was part of § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866  Congress intended to reach both private discrimination and discrimination under color of state law).[2]\n",
      "Having held that § 1981 by its terms prohibits private discrimination as well as discrimination under color of state law, the Supreme Court in Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, 491 U.S. 701, 109 S.Ct. 2702, 105 L.Ed.2d 598 (1989), considered whether § 1981 created a private right of action to enforce that prohibition against state actors. Pointing to the fact that the Civil Rights Act of 1866, as originally enacted, contained a penal provision \"explicitly directed at state officials\" while \"nowhere . . . provid[ing] for an express damages remedy for violation of\" § 1981, the Court concluded that \"the express cause of action for damages created by § 1983 constitutes the exclusive federal remedy for violation of the rights guaranteed in § 1981 by state governmental units.\" Id. at 720-721, 733, 109 S.Ct. 2702. The Court thus held that the prohibition on discrimination by a state or its officials contained in § 1981 can be enforced against state actors only by means of § 1983. The primary practical consequence of that holding, highlighted in Jett, was that actions for vicarious liability would not lie against state actors because of the \"custom or policy\" limitation on actions against municipalities under § 1983. See Jett, 491 U.S. at 735-36, 109 S.Ct. 2702 (holding that, because § 1983 is the exclusive remedy for violation of § 1981 by a state actor, \"petitioner must show that the violation of his right . . . was caused by a custom or policy within the meaning of Monell\") (quotation marks omitted); Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs. of City of N.Y., 436 U.S. 658, 690-91, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).\n",
      "Two years after Jett, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Section 101 of which added two new subsections to 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The new subsection (c) provides:\n",
      "(c) Protection against impairment\n",
      "The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.\n",
      "In their reports on the bill, the House Education and Labor Committee and the House Committee on the Judiciary both indicated that the purpose of subsection (c) was to codify Runyon v. McCrary. See H.R. REP. No. 102-40(I), at 92 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 549, 630 (citing Runyon and stating that § 1981(c) \"confirms section 1981's coverage of both public and private sector employment\"); H.R. REP. No. 102-40(II), at 37 (1991), reprinted in 1991 U.S.C.C.A.N. 694, 731 (subsection (c) \"is intended to codify Runyon v. McCrary\"). The legislative history of the subsection nowhere makes reference to Jett, or to the availability of a private cause of action against states or state officials.\n",
      "Pittman contends that the addition of subsection (c) to § 1981 overruled Jett to create a cause of action against both municipalities and arms of the state. Pittman does not contend, nor would the language of the statute suggest, that the amendment explicitly created a right of action against arms of the state. She argues, however, that subsection (c) contains an implied right of action against both municipalities and state actors.\n",
      "*1069 In determining whether a statute contains an implied private right of action, this circuit continues to look to the fourfactor test outlined in Cort v. Ash, 422 U.S. 66, 95 S.Ct. 2080, 45 L.Ed.2d 26 (1975). See Orkin v. Taylor, 487 F.3d 734, 738 (9th Cir.2007). Under Cort, courts consider:\n",
      "1) \"[I]s the plaintiff one of the class for whose especial benefit the statute was enacted\"? Cort, 422 U.S. at 78, 95 S.Ct. 2080 (quotation marks omitted).\n",
      "2) \"[I]s there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or implicit, either to create . . . a [federal] remedy or to deny one\"? Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) \"[I]s it consistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply such a remedy\"? Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) \"[I]s the cause of action one traditionally relegated to state law\"? Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although we continue to consider the four factors outlined in Cort, we also note that subsequent Supreme Court decisions have clarified that \"legislative intent\" is the \"most important inquiry.\" See Orkin, 487 F.3d at 739; Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.S. 560, 575, 99 S.Ct. 2479, 61 L.Ed.2d 82 (1979) (the \"central inquiry [is] whether Congress intended to create, either expressly or by implication, a private cause of action\").\n",
      "All of the other circuits to reach the question have held that the 1991 amendments and the addition of subsection (c) did not overrule Jett, and that there is still no cause of action against municipalities or other state actors. In Butts v. County of Volusia, 222 F.3d 891 (11th Cir.2000), for example, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed both the language of the statute and the legislative history of the amendments and concluded that there was no evidence of \"Congress' desire to alter the Supreme Court's conclusion in Jett.\" Id. at 894. Examining the language of the amendments, Butts determined that it is \"clear that [§ 1981(c)] creates a right that private or state actors may violate but does not itself create a remedy for that violation.\" Id. As to the legislative history, the court noted that the purpose of the amendment was \"to codify the Supreme Court's decision in Runyon v. McCrary.\" Id.; see also Bolden v. City of Topeka, 441 F.3d 1129, 1137 (10th Cir.2006) (\"[E]ven after the 1991 amendments to § 1981, damages claims against state actors for § 1981 violations must be brought under § 1983.\"); Oden v. Oktibbeha County, 246 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir.2001) (no private cause of action against state actors under § 1981 even after the amendments); Dennis v. County of Fairfax, 55 F.3d 151, 156 n. 1 (4th Cir.1995) (§ 1981(c) did not \"overrule Jett's holding with respect to municipal liability but only [codified] Runyon v. McCrary\").\n",
      "We, however, in Federation of African American Contractors v. City of Oakland, 96 F.3d 1204 (9th Cir.1996), concluded that the addition of subsection (c) overruled Jett to create a cause of action against municipalities. In reaching this holding, we acknowledged that \"the amended 42 U.S.C. § 1981 does not expressly authorize private claimants to sue state actors directly.\" Id. at 1210. But we held that \"the amended 42 U.S.C. § 1981 contains a cause of action against state actors.\" Id. at 1214.\n",
      "Applying the Cort factors, the court determined that \"the statute, by its plain terms, creates federal civil rights in favor of a class of persons that include[d]\" the plaintiffs, a group of African-American contractors who alleged that they had been discriminated against on the basis of race by the city of Oakland. Id. at 1211. As to legislative intent, the court held that, although Congress did not mention an intent to overrule Jett, it did intend to provide \"parallel protection against private and governmental entities\":\n",
      "\n",
      "*1070 Because § 1981(c) affords identical protection against \"impairment by nongovernmental discrimination\" and \"impairment under color of State law,\" and because § 1981(c) implicitly codifies an implied cause of action against private defendants, we infer that § 1981(c) also contains an implied cause of action against state actors who \"impair\" a claimant's § 1981 rights.\n",
      "Id. at 1213.\n",
      "The court went on to hold that actions against state actors who violate federal civil rights \"have not been traditionally relegated to state law,\" and that a cause of action was not inconsistent with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme. Id. at 1213-14. In reaching this final conclusion, the court acknowledged that there was already a remedy for violations of § 1981 by municipalities under § 1983. It noted, however, that \"there is no alternative enforcement mechanism in the revised 42 U.S.C. § 1981 itself,\" and that implying a cause of action against municipalities under § 1981 \"imposes no substantive change on federal civil rights law,\" because such actions were already possible under § 1983.[3]Id. at 1214. Notably, the argument that § 1981 contains a cause of action against municipalities was raised in Federation in an attempt to free plaintiffs from the obligation to demonstrate a \"policy or custom\" as required under Monell to impose liability on local government units under § 1983. Id (noting that appeal presents the issue whether § 1981(c) overrules Jett, \"and, if so, whether the Act relieves plaintiffs from alleging that their civil rights were violated as a result of an official `policy or custom'\"). Federation ultimately held on the latter question that the \"policy or custom\" requirement pertains to municipalities sued under § 1981. 96 F.3d at 1215. The result, as Federation stressed, was that the availability of a cause of action under § 1981 worked no practical change in the outcome that would have obtained under Jett. Id. at 1214.\n",
      "B. Pittman argues that the reasoning of Federation necessarily applies not only to municipalities, but to arms of the state. The argument is a substantial one in two respects. First, the language of § 1981(c) itself does not support any distinction between municipalities and arms of the state. The statute merely affirms that it prohibits discrimination \"under color of law,\" and both municipal actors and arms of the state act \"under color of law.\" Second, much of Federation's analysis of whether it is appropriate to imply a private right of action does not depend on any distinction between municipalities and state entities. The statute, by its plain terms, creates rights in favor of individuals who have been discriminated against in employment on the basis of race. Further, causes of action against state actors for violation of federal civil rights have also not traditionally been relegated to state law.\n",
      "We nonetheless reject the extension of Federation to suits against arms of the state, for other reasons we conclude are more weighty. Most notably, the reasoning of Federation depended in part on its conclusion that implication of a cause of action against municipalities under § 1981 \"imposes no substantive change on federal *1071 civil rights law,\" because it does not expand the remedies available under § 1981 beyond those already available under § 1983. Id. The Employment Department argues that, in contrast, recognizing a cause of action against state actors under § 1981, would, in fact, expand the remedies available under that statute beyond those available under § 1983. On examination, that is so.\n",
      "As the Supreme Court has applied the Eleventh Amendment, \"an unconsenting State is immune from suits brought in federal courts by her own citizens as well as by citizens of another State.\" Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 662-63, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974). Municipalities, in contrast, are not entitled to sovereign immunity in federal court. See Bd. of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 369, 121 S.Ct. 955, 148 L.Ed.2d 866 (2001) (\"[T]he Eleventh Amendment does not extend its immunity to units of local government.\"); Beentjes v. Placer County Air Pollution Control Dist., 397 F.3d 775, 777-78 (9th Cir.2005) (Eleventh Amendment does not extend to municipal corporations or other political subdivisions that are not arms of the state).\n",
      "There are, however, exceptions to Eleventh Amendment immunity. When acting pursuant to its authority under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress can abrogate the sovereign immunity of the states. See Atascadero State Hosp. v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. 234, 238, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985) (superseded by statute on other grounds). Sovereign immunity also does not bar suits for prospective injunctive relief against individual state officials acting in their official capacity. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 156-57, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908). Moreover, a state may waive its Eleventh Amendment immunity  by, for example, removing an action to federal court, which is what happened in this case. See Lapides v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 535 U.S. 613, 620, 122 S.Ct. 1640, 152 L.Ed.2d 806 (2002) (by removing to federal court, a state \"voluntarily invoke[s]\" federal jurisdiction and thereby waives its immunity).\n",
      "Applying these principles of sovereign immunity to cases under § 1983 and § 1981, courts have held that states enjoy sovereign immunity from suits brought under both statutes. In Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979), the Supreme Court made clear that § 1983 \"does not explicitly and by clear language indicate on its face an intent to sweep away the immunity of the States\" as required for an abrogation of sovereign immunity. Id. at 345, 99 S.Ct. 1139. Similarly, we, like all of the courts of appeal that have reached the issue, have concluded that states enjoy sovereign immunity under § 1981 in the absence of waiver. Mitchell v. Los Angeles Cmty. Coll. Dist., 861 F.2d 198, 201 (9th Cir.1988) (\"[T]he district is a state entity that possesses eleventh amendment immunity from the appellants section 1981, 1983, and 1985 claims.\"); see also Singletary v. Missouri Dep't of Corr., 423 F.3d 886, 890 (8th Cir. 2005) (joining \"other circuits [that] have uniformly held that a state is immunized from § 1981 liability under the Eleventh Amendment\"); Freeman v. Michigan Dep't. of State, 808 F.2d 1174, 1178 (6th Cir.1987) (Eleventh Amendment prevents relief against a state under § 1981); Sessions v. Rusk State Hosp., 648 F.2d 1066, 1069 (5th Cir.1981) (same).\n",
      "The ability to bring an action against a state is governed, of course, not only by sovereign immunity, but also by whether the statute itself creates a cause of action against a state. As the Supreme Court held in Jett that there was no cause of action against state actors under § 1981, plaintiffs wishing to enforce § 1981's prohibitions against a state actor were relegated to the cause of action available under *1072 § 1983.[4] Interpreting § 1983, the Supreme Court has held that the term \"person\" under § 1983 encompasses municipalities but not states. Monell, 436 U.S. at 658, 98 S.Ct. 2018 (municipalities); Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989) (arms of the state). Under § 1983, then, the availability of sovereign immunity is coextensive with the availability of a cause of action against a state actor, whether a municipality or an arm of the state. And while Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity does not apply in state court, the practical effect of the holding in Will is that actions against arms of the state under both § 1983 and § 1981 cannot be brought in either federal or state court, because the cause of action in § 1983 does not reach arms of the state.\n",
      "For this reason, holding that § 1981(c) creates a cause of action against state actors would bring about some change in federal civil rights law that was not created by allowing actions against municipalities. Such a holding would allow cases in federal court against arms of the state in those instances in which they waive their Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity, as the State has in this case. Perhaps more importantly, it would allow actions in state court against arms of the state for violations of § 1981, at least when the state does not invoke sovereign immunity under its own law in its own courts.\n",
      "The Supreme Court has instructed that allowing suits against states in state court is a significant alteration in the federal/state balance that must be supported by a clear statement of Congressional intent. In Will v. Michigan Dep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989), the Supreme Court addressed the question whether the word \"person\" in § 1983 includes arms of the state. In holding that it did not, the Court began by noting that \"the question whether a State is a person under § 1983 [is] squarely before us since the Eleventh Amendment does not apply in state courts.\" Id. at 63-64, 109 S.Ct. 2304. The Court then held that, while \"the scope of the Eleventh Amendment and the scope of § 1983 are [] separate issues,\" id. at 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, it was appropriate to look to Eleventh Amendment cases requiring that where \"Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\" Id. at 65, 109 S.Ct. 2304 (quoting Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 242, 105 S.Ct. 3142) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court viewed it as highly unlikely, given that Congress did not abrogate state sovereign immunity under § 1983, \"that Congress intended nevertheless to create a cause of action against States to be brought in state courts, which are precisely the courts Congress sought to allow civil rights claimants to avoid through § 1983.\"[5]Id. at 66, 109 *1073 S.Ct. 2304. Given these concerns, the Court concluded that § 1983 did not clearly express Congressional intent to create a cause of action against arms of the state.\n",
      "Will, then, suggests that the creation of a right of action against state actors under a civil rights statute, even where there is no question of abrogating the state's sovereign immunity, constitutes an \"alter[ation in] the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government\" for which \"unmistakably clear language\" is required. We do not find it necessary to address here whether \"unmistakably clear language\" is always required to find an implied right of action against a state under a civil rights statute. Will nonetheless suggests that, at the least, there must be some evidence of Congressional intent to impose liability on states in order to find such an implied right of action.\n",
      "In fact, neither the language nor the legislative history of the statute suggests any intent to create a private right of action against arms of the state. Federation is not to the contrary, as it did not involve the application of Will; concerned only municipalities, not states; and stressed that it worked no practical changes in civil rights law because of the absence of sovereign immunity protection for municipalities.\n",
      "C. Our conclusion that § 1981(c) does not create a private right of action against states is bolstered by developments in the Supreme Court's approach to private rights of action that have occurred since this court issued its decision in Federation. In Gonzaga University v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 122 S.Ct. 2268, 153 L.Ed.2d 309 (2002), the Supreme Court made clear that, in determining whether a private right of action can be implied from a particular statute, rights-creating language is not determinative:\n",
      ". . . [E]ven where a statute is phrased in . . . explicit rights-creating terms, a plaintiff suing under an implied right of action still must show that the statute manifests an intent \"to create not just a private right but also a private remedy.\"\n",
      "Id. at 284, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (emphasis in original) (quoting Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 286, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001)). Section 1981(c) is phrased \"in . . . explicit rights-creating terms,\" but says nothing about a private remedy, nor does the legislative history.\n",
      "The holding in Gonzaga was not a significant departure from previous Supreme Court case law, which, beginning in the 1970s, has increasingly emphasized the distinction between rights and remedies. See Virginia Bankshares, Inc. v. Sandberg, 501 U.S. 1083, 1102, 111 S.Ct. 2749, 115 L.Ed.2d 929 (1991) (\"[R]ecognition of any private right of action for violating a federal statute must ultimately rest on congressional intent to provide a private remedy.\"); Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.S. 11, 15-16, 100 S.Ct. 242, 62 L.Ed.2d 146 (1979) (\"what must ultimately be determined is whether Congress intended to create the private remedy asserted\"). Nor does it lead us to believe that Federation can or must be overruled. See Hulteen v. AT & T Corp., 498 F.3d 1001, 1009 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc) (\"A three-judge panel must follow a prior circuit decision unless a subsequent decision by a relevant court of last resort either effectively overrules the decision in a case `closely on point' or undercuts the reasoning underlying the circuit precedent rendering the cases `clearly irreconcilable.'\"). Cf. Day v. Apoliona, 496 F.3d 1027, 1031 (9th Cir.2007) (\"Gonzaga and other recent Supreme Court cases concerning *1074 § 1983 rights have not so changed the law that it is now irreconcilable with our prior cases\"). Nonetheless, the clarity of the Supreme Court's recent command in Gonzaga regarding the insufficiency of rights-creating language with regard to the implication of a private cause of action supports our hesitation to extend Federation further in the absence of any evidence of Congressional intent to provide a remedy for violations of § 1981 by arms of the state.[6]\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "For the foregoing reasons, we hold that § 1981 does not contain a cause of action against states. The district court's dismissal of Pittman's § 1981 action against the State of Oregon Employment Department is AFFIRMED.\n",
      "NOTES\n",
      "[*]  The Honorable Judith Barzilay of the United States Court of International Trade, sitting by designation.\n",
      "[1]  Defendants further contended that Deborah Lincoln was not properly a party to the action because she had not been served. The court held that Lincoln had not been properly served, and dismissed the action against her. That ruling has not been challenged on appeal.\n",
      "[2]  42 U.S.C. § 1982 provides:\n",
      "\n",
      "All citizens of the United States shall have the same right, in every State and Territory, as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof to inherit, purchase, lease, sell, hold, and convey real and personal property.\n",
      "[3]  Although Federation refers in parts to \"state actors,\" it is clear from the context of the entire opinion  and from Federation's observation that its decision would not create a substantive change in the law  that it focused only on private causes of action against municipalities and other local government units. Federation involved a challenge to discrimination by Alameda County. Fed. of African American Contractors v. City of Oakland, 96 F.3d at 1205. (Although the caption continued to list \"City of Oakland\" as the first defendant, Federation involved an appeal from dismissal of the contractors' first amended complaint, which named only Alameda County as a defendant).\n",
      "[4]  Section 1983 provides, in relevant part:\n",
      "\n",
      "Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress. . . .\n",
      "[5]  While Will does provide support for the State's position, it does not do so on the basis the state argues in its brief. The State maintains that a holding that there is a cause of action against a state would, unlike in Federation, work a substantive change in civil rights law because \"state agencies are immune from lawsuits filed against them under § 1983.\" But states are also immune from suits in federal court under § 1981. Actions under § 1981 would still be barred by sovereign immunity in federal courts in the absence of waiver. The true differences would be with regard to waived Eleventh Amendment immunity and in the ability to bring § 1981 actions in state court.\n",
      "[6]  We note that, while implied rights of action necessarily require an intent to create a remedy, such an intent is unnecessary for creation of a right enforceable under § 1983. See Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 287, 122 S.Ct. 2268 (2002); Ball v. Rodgers, 492 F.3d 1094, 1103 (9th Cir.2007) (holding that the \"language of the [Medicaid] free choice provisions is sufficiently rights-creating\" to be enforced under § 1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n",

But rather than hew to this Court's precedent requiring neutrality, and acknowledging that personal freedoms do not end at the schoolhouse door, the Circuit Court established a bright-line rule that any personal religious expression in view of students is forbidden.

And, while the District does not appear to suggest that it is entitled to a categorical rule discriminating on the basis of religious \"status\" ( i.e., that a person is a Christian or holds Christian beliefs), the District does, in effect, argue that it can propagate a categorical rule to prevent observant Christians from revealing, even in the most diminutive of ways, any outward expression or \"use\" of their religion while on the job.

      "cases, however, the Court has focused much of its attention on the possibility of\n",
      "coercing the participation of students in state-sponsored religion. E.g., id. at 587. In\n",
      "the context of compulsory education laws, such a concern with coercion is natural,\n",

      "subjective responses may be relevant on the question of damages, we do not believe\n",
      "that strictly speaking they go to the merits of the establishment clause issue. The\n",
      "government can permissibly engage in any number of activities that its citizens find\n",
      "deeply offensive without violating the Constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      " We agree with the district court that the practices at issue in this case are\n",
      "unconstitutional, but we think that they are constitutionally infirm not because they\n",
      "offended Mr. Warnock but because they endorsed religion. The government, of\n",
      "course, may speak on a large number of different issues. The Constitution, however,\n",
      "forbids it from conveying the message that it decisively endorses a particular religious\n",
      "position. See Lynch, 465 U.S. at 682. We believe that prayers at mandatory teacher\n",
      "meetings and in-service training conveys such a decisive endorsement.\n",
      "\n",
      " The defendants rely on our decision in Brown v. Polk County, Iowa, 61 F.3d\n",
      "650, 658-59 (8th Cir. 1995), (en banc), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1158 (1996), where we\n",
      "held that a county could not order an employee to desist from \"any activities that\n",
      "could be considered religious proselytizing, witnessing, or counseling\" without\n",
      "running afoul of the free exercise clause. They argue that the prayers at issue here are\n",
      "analogous to the protected activity in Brown. But this case is distinguishable on three\n",
      "grounds. First, Brown involved a free exercise challenge to a government prohibition\n",
      "of religious activity rather than an establishment clause challenge to ongoing\n",
      "\n",
      "  -5-\n",
      "\f",
      "religious activity by the government itself. Second, virtually all of the activity at\n",
      "issue in Brown was clearly private speech: It involved personal statements by\n",
      "Mr. Brown about his own beliefs and personal religious effects in his office. Third,\n",
      "the prayers offered at government meetings in Brown were informal, sporadic, and\n",
      "spontaneous. Id. at 652-53. An objective observer of such behavior could not\n",
      "conclude that the government was endorsing Mr. Brown's faith.\n",
      "\n",
      " In contrast, some of the prayers at issue here were offered in mandatory\n",
      "teachers' meetings by the official conducting the meetings, circumstances that would\n",
      "lead an objective observer to conclude that the government was explicitly endorsing\n",
      "the religious content of the prayers offered. The same is true of the requirement that\n",
      "Mr. Warnock attend in-service training at a religious college where prayers were\n",
      "offered as part of the training. This endorsement, rather than any offensive or\n",
      "coercive impact that the prayers had on Mr. Warnock, is what we believe makes them\n",
      "unconstitutional.\n",
      "\n",
      "  III.\n",
      " The resolution of Mr. Warnock's challenge to the scope of the district court's\n",
      "injunctive relief follows from the nature of the government's establishment clause\n",
      "violation. The district court enjoined the defendants from praying at mandatory\n",
      "meetings when Mr. Warnock was present and directed that Mr. Warnock be allowed\n",
      "to opt out of any in-service training where prayers would be offered. We review a\n",
      "district court's decision to issue an injunction for an abuse of discretion. Shen v. Leo\n",
      "A. Daly Co., 222 F.3d 472, 477 (8th Cir. 2000). In this case, we conclude that the\n",
      "injunction should be modified.\n",
      "\n",
      " The district court crafted its injunction so as to spare Mr. Warnock a potentially\n",
      "offensive confrontation with prayers at mandatory teacher meetings or in-service\n",
      "training. We think that the difficulty with this approach is that it either conceives of\n",
      "the constitutional violation in terms of Mr. Warnock's subjective feelings of offense,\n",
      "\n",
      "  -6-\n",
      "\f",
      "or is premised on the proposition that the primary establishment clause violation in\n",
      "this case lies in the fact that Mr. Warnock was being coerced or religiously\n",
      "indoctrinated by the state. As we noted above, however, we believe that it is the\n",
      "government's endorsement of a particular religious message that constitutes the\n",
      "constitutional violation here, not the effects of official prayers on Mr. Warnock's\n",
      "psyche. Hence the district court's injunction does not cure the constitutional violation\n",
      "because it continues to allow the defendants to engage in conduct that violates the\n",
      "establishment clause so long as Mr. Warnock is not present. The meaning of the\n",
      "establishment clause, however, cannot turn on where Mr. Warnock happens to be\n",
      "when a government official engages in a prayer at an official function.\n",
      "\n",
      " To the extent that the injunction embodies this mistaken view of the\n",
      "establishment clause, we conclude that it must be modified. Cf. National Basketball\n",
      "Ass'n v. Minnesota Prof'l Basketball, Ltd. P'ship, 56 F.3d 866, 870 (8th Cir. 1995).\n",
      "It is true, of course, that courts may use their equitable discretion to grant injunctions\n",
      "that do not reach every illegality at issue in a suit. As the Supreme Court has\n",
      "observed in the establishment clause context, \"equitable remedies are a special blend\n",
      "of what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable.\" Lemon, 411 U.S. at 200\n",
      "(footnote omitted). The decision to grant an injunction that does not reach all illegal\n",
      "behavior, however, must turn on a careful weighing of the equities in the case and\n",
      "highly situational judgments about judicial competence and the efficacy of a court\n",
      "order. See, e.g., 1 Dan B. Dobbs, Law of Remedies § 2.9(5), at 242 (2d ed. 1993). In\n",
      "this case, there is nothing to suggest that the district court's injunction rested or could\n",
      "have rested on such a discretionary judgment. Hence, we remand the case with\n",
      "instructions to modify the injunction to preclude prayers at mandatory meetings\n",
      "regardless of whether Mr. Warnock is present.\n",
      "\n",
      "  IV.\n",
      " We turn next to Mr. Warnock's argument that the district court erred in failing\n",
      "to grant him relief from religious harassment. Mr. Warnock asks that we increase the\n",
      "\n",
      "  -7-\n",
      "\f",
      "award of compensatory damages to take into account the allegedly unconstitutional\n",
      "harassment that he suffered. We review the district court's factual findings for clear\n",
      "error and apply the law to Mr. Warnock's case de novo.\n",
      "\n",
      " As a threshold matter, we note that some of the \"harassment\" that Mr. Warnock\n",

      "personal religious effects – such as a framed psalm on the wall of Mr. Archer's office\n",
      "– were harassing. But people do not give up their free-exercise or free-speech rights\n",
      "when they become government employees. See Brown, 61 F.3d at 652-59. When\n",
      "their speech and acts can reasonably be attributed to the government itself, of course,\n",
      "the restrictions of the establishment clause apply. But when such activity is clearly\n",
      "personal and does not convey the impression that the government is endorsing it, the\n",
      "mere fact that it occurs in a government setting does not render it unconstitutional.\n",

      "endorsement of or indifference to the student's action. Furthermore, in light of the\n",
      "fact that the cross was removed before Mr. Warnock ever saw it, we cannot say that\n",
      "the first amendment requires a more draconian response by school officials to insure\n",

      "The Upshur County West Virginia School Board has, for some years now, allowed non-student, private groups such as Little League, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union to distribute literature in the Upshur County public schools.  In accordance with written policy, however, the Board has denied groups wishing to distribute religious or political materials the same access to the County's schools.  Three years ago, in response to a request by a local religious group, and in an attempt to blunt the Board's discrimination against private religious and political speech, the Board interpreted its written policy so as to allow the passive distribution of religious (and political) material in the schools.  Pursuant to this new policy, the Board thereafter designated a single day during the year on which private religious groups can make Bibles or other religious material available on tables set up in accessible locations, such as halls or libraries, in the Upshur County schools.  The table displays are set up and stocked entirely by private citizens who are not affiliated in any way with the schools, and the tables bear signs informing students only that they should feel free to take the Bibles or other material offered.  Pursuant to district court injunction, the tables also bear a disclaimer, renouncing any sponsorship or endorsement by the school.  No one is allowed to enter classrooms to announce the availability of the religious or political material, or to stand at the tables to encourage or pressure students to take the material.  No school announcement or assembly is allowed to mark the availability of the Bibles or any other religious or political material.  School principals are charged with ensuring strict compliance with these guidelines.\n",

      "Upon challenge by appellants, the district court held that the School Board could, for one day during the year, permit the table displays without violating the Establishment Clause because the Board has a neutral policy of allowing religious and nonreligious groups alike to set up such displays in the schools, and because the displays do not constitute an impermissible endorsement of religion.  Except as to one aspect of the district court's judgment discussed below, we affirm.\n",

      "The Upshur County School Board has historically allowed nonstudent, private groups, such as Little League, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, 4-H, and the Women's Christian Temperance Union, to distribute literature in the schools, although there has been no formal, written policy to this effect.  Superintendent Lynn E. Westfall or school activity personnel \"review materials before they are made available to be distributed to students,\" J.A. at 96, 104, 136, to ensure that the materials are age \"appropriate\" and not \"harmful to children\" and that the materials will not cause a \"[m]ajor disruption\" of the school environment.

In response to an incident in which members of the Gideons \"went into the classroom, talked to the students, and then handed Bibles to the students,\" J.A. at 122-23, 102, however, the School Board adopted a policy in 1989 prohibiting the \"distribution\" of religious or political advocacy materials to students in the County's schools.  The 1989 Policy states in relevant part:\n",

      "During the summer of 1994, two state senators, a local businessman, and Ed McDaniels, a local teacher and minister, approached Superintendent Westfall to ask whether the Board could legally allow religious groups to set up \"a table in a predetermined location [in an Upshur County school] with religious material upon it [accessible] to students, where students [could] freely come by and pick up\" the materials.  J.A. at 182.  McDaniels and his supporters believed that then-recent Supreme Court decisions, including Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District, 508 U.S. 384, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993);  Board of Education of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990);  and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), confirmed that, pursuant to a neutral practice of allowing the distribution of literature in the schools, the Board could allow McDaniels' group to make Bibles and other religious material available to students without violating the Establishment Clause and that, in fact, to deny the group the opportunity to do so would affirmatively discriminate against religious speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "In response to the group's request, Westfall sought legal counsel and was advised that there might be Establishment Clause concerns if the Board were to allow personal distribution of Bibles and other religious materials, but that \"[t]here was neither statutory nor case law specifically prohibiting\" the Board from allowing religious groups to passively make Bibles or other religious material available in the manner proposed.  J.A. at 102-03, 224, 243, 302.  Westfall informed the other members of the Upshur County School Board of this advice, J.A. at 302, and also of the fact that some of McDaniels' supporters were considering pursuing in court their claim that the Board's policy of forbidding private religious speech impermissibly discriminated against such speech.  J.A. at 296.\n",

      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "At its December 6, 1994, meeting, the School Board considered McDaniels' request that religious groups be allowed to make Bibles available to Upshur County students one day during the year at predetermined locations in the schools, framing its inquiry as whether McDaniels' request could be accommodated under the language of the existing 1989 Policy.  J.A. at 240, 243, 251-52, 268-69.  After hearing testimony in support of McDaniels' request, the Board interpreted \"distribute\" in its 1989 Policy to mean \"to hand to, to pass out,\" J.A. at 21, and distinguished such distribution from passively making materials available for students to pick up if they wished.  Thus, the Board determined that the 1989 Policy did not prohibit private groups from making Bibles and other religious material available to students on tables located in the schools.  Accordingly, the Board \"instructed the Superintendent to meet with Mr. McDaniels to arrange a day for making Bibles available to students of Upshur County schools.\" J.A. at 330.\n",

      "Superintendent Westfall met with McDaniels on February 14, 1995, to select the day on which McDaniels would be allowed to make Bibles available and to establish the guidelines that McDaniels and his group were to follow.  Because the Board was sensitive to possible Establishment Clause concerns, Westfall imposed a number of restrictions on the manner in which the Bibles could be made available.  The private groups making the Bibles available were to be responsible for setting up the tables on which the Bibles would be displayed.  J.A. at 24.  Bibles not picked up by students during the day were to be removed at the end of that day by the groups responsible for the display.  J.A. at 24.  No teacher or other school employee was to participate in these or any other custodial activity relating to the Bible displays.  J.A. at 108.  The tables were to be placed in a location in each school (such as a library or hall) that was accessible to students, J.A. at 108, 374, \"where students normally congregate and would not feel they were being watched or pressured into taking a Bible,\" J.A. at 374 (district court op.); there was to be a sign on each table that read \"Please feel free to take one,\" J.A. at 24, 94;  and the source of the Bibles was not to be identified, J.A. at 95.  No one was to be allowed to stand at the table to encourage or pressure students to take Bibles, J.A. at 25, and no one was to be allowed to enter classrooms to discuss the Bibles' availability, J.A. at 108-09.  Moreover, the schools were not to announce that Bibles were available or hold any school assembly in connection with the availability of the Bibles.  J.A. at 108.  Westfall also \"reiterated in that meeting that everyone understood that any other religious material representing any other religious beliefs would be given equal opportunity either on that day or some other day to be arranged ... in the same manner [that the Bibles were] to be made available to students.\" J.A. at 25.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "Additionally, Westfall advised Upshur County school principals that the Board was supervising access to the schools, not sponsoring or promoting the dissemination of Bibles, and instructed the principals to ensure compliance with the guidelines.  J.A. at 25-26, 375 (district court op.).  Westfall also told principals that if a kindergartner was unable to read the sign, the principal could read it to him or help the student to read the sign as a reading exercise.  J.A. at 25.\n",

      "On February 23, 1995, appellants filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to enjoin the scheduled placement of Bibles on tables in the schools.  After a brief hearing on February 24, 1995, the district court preliminarily enjoined appellees from providing access to the schools to any individual or group seeking to make Bibles available until a hearing could be held on the merits of appellants' challenge.  A trial on a permanent injunction was then held on May 30, 1995, and on September 30, 1996, the district court issued a memorandum opinion and order vacating the preliminary injunction and denying a permanent injunction.  J.A. at 3-7, 371-403.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "In denying a permanent injunction, the district court held that the Upshur County School Board had not created a public forum in its schools, but had created \"through policy and practice, ... a nonpublic or 'limited purpose' forum to which selective access is permitted for the purpose of enhancing the educational mission of the public schools.\" J.A. at 383.  The court noted that under Lamb's Chapel, \"[c]ontrol over access to a nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint neutral,\" J.A. at 384 (quoting Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 392-93, 113 S.Ct. 2141). Because the Board had decided that distribution of Bibles was consistent with the educational mission of schools to expose children to a wide variety of views, the court concluded that plaintiffs were demanding that the court \"enforce an impermissible viewpoint discrimination against religious material that the Board has concluded is consistent with the purpose of the forum.\" J.A. at 385.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "The district court then held that making the Bibles available would not violate the Establishment Clause.  The court first applied the \"neutrality test,\" and concluded that the passive distribution of the Bible was permitted pursuant to a neutral government policy of providing access to the Upshur County schools for private expression consistent with the educational mission of the schools.  J.A. at 392-94, 383-85.  The Bible hand-out was private religious expression, not government speech, the district court reasoned, because it was privately sponsored and carried out by private citizens.  J.A. at 393.  The court also concluded that the Board's equal access policy did not discriminate in favor of Christianity--even if it incidentally benefitted Christian religions--because the policy allowed handouts of \" 'religious materials' generally.\" J.A. at 394.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16\n",
      "The district court also held that making the Bible available to students was not an impermissible endorsement of religion.  The court concluded that a \"reasonable student\" would not be likely to view the Bible distribution as an endorsement because that student would know that the Board allows other organizations to distribute literature;  because school personnel would not be involved in the distribution of the Bibles;  because the signs on the tables would emphasize that taking a Bible was completely voluntary;  and because an express disclaimer could be affixed that would further negate any appearance of endorsement.  J.A. at 397-99.  The court acknowledged that the Board's policy granted speakers access to a captive audience of Upshur County students, but found that\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "[t]he fact that school age children, presumably of all faiths, are compelled to be in close proximity to the forum is counterbalanced by the voluntary basis on which the religious materials will be made available.  No student will be forced to take a Bible, and the mere fact that students might inadvertently come into contact with an unattended table full of free Bibles does not, in this Court's opinion, present a significant risk of perceived \"endorsement\" of Christianity in light of the general context in which the \"reasonable student\" will perceive the tables.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "J.A. at 400.  The court also found that the schools would have to take into account the \"age appropriateness\" of the Bible handout, perhaps implying that modifications of the plan might be required if the children were too young to distinguish between private and government speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "The plaintiffs thereafter moved for a stay of the decision and reinstatement of the preliminary injunction pending appeal.  On October 24, 1996, the district court declined to reinstate the injunction because it concluded that the injunction would violate the First Amendment rights of those citizens who wanted to make the Bibles available.  The district court did, however, enjoin the Board to post a disclaimer sign on the tables with language substantially as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "The Supreme Court has, over the past decade, consistently sustained against Establishment Clause challenge neutral government policies that permit private religious speech on and within state educational and other properties on the same terms as private secular speech is permitted.

Rector of University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 2520-25, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) (holding that university could pay the publication expenses of a student Christian newspaper in accordance with its general policy of funding student newspapers);  Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, 515 U.S. 753, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 2447-50, 132 L.Ed.2d 650 (1995) (plurality) (holding that a state could, pursuant to a \"religiously neutral\" policy, permit a private party to display a cross in a traditional public forum located next to the state's seat of government);  id. 515 U.S. at 770-74, 115 S.Ct. at 2451-52 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment);  Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 395-97, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (holding that a school could allow after-hours access to its facilities to a religious group when the school had made its facilities generally available to a wide variety of public organizations);  Mergens, 496 U.S. at 247-53, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (1990) (plurality) (holding that a high school could officially recognize a student religious club and afford it the same benefits as other student clubs);  id. at 260-62, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (same);  Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270-75, 102 S.Ct. 269 (holding that a university could allow a student religious group to use university facilities that were generally available for activities of student groups).  Indeed, the Supreme Court has recently affirmed that the neutrality of a government program is a \"significant factor in upholding [it] in the face of Establishment Clause attack.\"  Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2521. As the Court has said, government acts neutrally if it acts for some purpose other than advancing religion, see id. 515 U.S. at 839-40, 115 S.Ct. at 2522, and if, when it opens a forum for private speech, it respects the distinction between government speech and private speech endorsing religion by refraining from encouraging any mistaken impression that the private speakers speak for the government, see id. 515 U.S. at 841-43, 115 S.Ct. at 2523.

At the conclusion of a full bench trial, the district court specifically found that the Board's \"express purpose\" for its practice of \"allow[ing] private speakers to access the public schools\" is to \"enhance [the students'] education by exposing them to a broad spectrum of knowledge.\" J.A. at 384.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that such \"an open-forum policy, including nondiscrimination against religious speech, [has] a secular purpose.\"  Widmar, 454 U.S. at 271, 102 S.Ct. 269 (footnotes omitted);  see also Mergens, 496 U.S. at 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality).\n",

      "The Board's decision, however, must be viewed against the backdrop of the Board's existing policy, which appellants would have the court wholly ignore.  Although, as noted, the Board had not adopted a written policy allowing the distribution of private material in the schools, the well established, historical practice of the Board was to allow distribution of such material (subject only to routine administrative review for age appropriateness), but to forbid distribution of religious and political material altogether.  The district court found that the Board had adopted this ban on the distribution of religious literature, not because it believed that such literature was inconsistent with the purpose of the school forum, but \"[s]olely\" because it believed \"that allowing Bibles to be distributed was a violation of the Establishment Clause.\" J.A. at 384-85.  When, in light of the Supreme Court's more recent precedents, McDaniels and other private citizens requested that they be allowed to make Bibles available, the Board was persuaded by their argument that the Establishment Clause did not require the Board's existing policy of complete exclusion of religious materials and discrimination against religious speech and, therefore, granted the citizens' request.  J.A. at 385.  And, indeed, the Supreme Court's decisions that had been rendered since the 1989 adoption of the Board's policy, including Lamb's Chapel and Mergens, had confirmed not only that the state could allow private religious speech in a state forum governed by a neutral policy of equal access, but that discrimination against religious speech in such a forum could violate the First Amendment.  Even appellants concede that the Board's 1989 policy, as originally interpreted, may well have been unconstitutional.  See Appellants' Reply Brief at 9.\n",

      "27\n",
      "Accordingly, as the district court found, when the Board acted to eliminate the absolute prohibition on private religious literature in the schools, \"the Board was not exhibiting any favoritism\" for religion in general or Christianity in particular, but was simply lifting one forum restriction on religious speech to which most other speech had never been subject and thereby \"permitting the distribution of Bibles and other religious material similar in character to material already permitted.\" J.A. at 385.  Cf. Capitol Square, 115 S.Ct. at 2447 (plurality) (\"We find it peculiar to say that government 'promotes' or 'favors' a religious display by giving it the same access to a public forum that all other displays enjoy.\").  As Board member Martha White Feola explained, \"the intention was to offer choices to children, not [to] put[ ] Bibles in their hands or any other religious materials.\" J.A. at 138.\n",

      "And, indeed, the Board's December 1994 interpretation of the word \"distribute\" in its 1989 policy on its face applies equally to all religious speech and to political speech, as well--the only two categories of speech restricted and disadvantaged by the 1989 policy.  Superintendent Westfall confirmed that the Board's policy clarification reaches all speech restricted by the 1989 policy, that the Board's position at its December meeting was that \"other materials would be made available equitably with the Bibles,\" J.A. at 225, and that the Board intended, by affirming a broad equal access policy, \"to provide equal availability to any other group that chose to offer to make materials available to students,\" J.A. at 22, 109-110.  See also J.A. at 128, Testimony of Superintendent Westfall (\"[The Board's] understanding from the outset of this issue [was] that other groups would have equal access to follow the same procedure\" for making literature available.); J.A. at 109-10, Testimony of Superintendent Westfall (stating that the Board communicated to those who attended the December 1994 Board meeting that groups that wanted to distribute other religious material would have equal access to the schools).  The Board clearly recognized that it was creating an \"open forum,\" to which political groups, adherents of all faiths, individuals opposed to religion, and others with a \"certain perspective they want to make available to students\" will share access.  J.A. at 128-29.  The record that we have before us thus provides every \"assurance that the next similarly situated group seeking\" access to the Upshur County school forums will receive access on the same--if not more favorable--terms than those under which McDaniels' group was provided access.  Board of Education of Kiryas Joel Village School District v. Grumet, 512 U.S. 687, 703, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).\n",

      "In fact, rather than elevating religious speech to a preferred status, the Board's policy clarification still leaves private religious speech at a disadvantage vis-a-vis most other speech, because it precludes religious speakers from delivering their messages to Upshur County students face-to-face.  The Board has also imposed numerous other restrictions on religious speech, in order to minimize Establishment Clause concerns, including, significantly, limiting religious speakers to a single day during the year on which to make their literature available, requiring an explicit disclaimer, and instructing principals to ensure compliance with the strict guidelines governing the displays of religious materials.  From all of these actions, it is evident that the Board has made a good faith effort to recognize the legitimate claim of its religious citizens under recent Supreme Court precedent not to be discriminated against in the Upshur County school forums, while attempting to mitigate the risk of \"abuses involving direct contact with students and potential religious proselytizing in the classroom,\" Appellees' Brief at 35.\n",

      "Nor is the fact that McDaniels' request to offer the Bibles was religiously motivated ultimately relevant to our inquiry as to the permissibility of the Board's action.  We do not impute an impermissible purpose to advance religion to an elected official merely because he responds to a religiously motivated constituent request, and the record is absolutely devoid of any evidence that would suggest that any Board member's vote was religiously motivated.  As the district court noted, J.A. at 388, appellants do not even contend that the Board was religiously motivated in allowing private citizens to offer the Bibles to the County's students;  appellants argue only that the decision was politically motivated.\n",

      "In sum, by accommodating its constituents' request that religious speech be allowed at least limited access to the Upshur County open school forums, the Board did nothing more than affirm \"the right of religious speakers to use [the Upshur County school] forums on equal terms with others,\" Widmar, 454 U.S. at 272 n. 12, 102 S.Ct. 269, and the Supreme Court has explicitly held that \"prevent[ing] discrimination against religious and other types of speech\" in a school forum is an \"undeniably secular\" purpose.

      "The neutrality of the Board's action is evidenced, not only by its secular purpose of reducing the extent of discrimination against religious speech, but also by the fact that the Board has affirmed and maintained the distinction between its own speech and the private religious speech that occurs in the school forum by acting affirmatively to discourage any mistaken impression that the private speakers are speaking for the Board or the schools.  See Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2522-23. In Rosenberger, the Supreme Court concluded that the University of Virginia had not fostered any mistaken impression that the views printed in the student publications it funded were its own, because the University made clear to the student publishers that funding should not be misinterpreted as responsibility for or approval of their publications, and because it required the student publications to include a written disclaimer, which made clear to readers that the publications were independent of the University.  See id. 515 U.S. at 823-25, 115 S.Ct. at 2514;  cf. Mergens, 496 U.S. at 251, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality) (\"To the extent a school makes clear that its recognition of [a student religious club] is not an endorsement of the views of the club's participants, students will reasonably understand that the school's official recognition of the club evinces neutrality toward, rather than endorsement of, religious speech.\")  (citations omitted).\n",

      "The Upshur County School Board has taken similar \"pains to disassociate itself from the private speech\" at issue in this case.  Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2523. The Board has informed McDaniels and his supporters that it is allowing them to make Bibles available because it has an equal access policy and does not wish to discriminate against religious speech, not because the Board wants students to embrace the religious message of the Bible.  See, e.g., J.A. at 25.  Additionally, the Board has taken significant steps to prevent Upshur County students from mistakenly concluding that the Board is sponsoring the Bible display by requiring, in accordance with the district court's injunction, that disclaimers be placed on the tables that explicitly state that the schools are neither endorsing nor sponsoring the display, and by setting strict guidelines which forbid any school teacher or employee from participating in any way in making the Bibles available.\n",

      "35\n",
      "Appellants advance two arguments that the Board has, notwithstanding these prophylactic steps, impermissibly blurred the line between private religious speech and government speech, such that the Bible displays are fairly attributable to the schools themselves.  First, appellants argue that the state has, in essence, transformed the private religious expression at issue in this case into government speech by allowing it to occur in school during school hours when state law mandates student attendance, thereby compelling a \"captive audience\" of students to receive the religious message.  Appellants' Brief at 17, 35-40 (\"[W]hen the government creates a captive audience through compulsory attendance laws and turns that audience over to a private religious group, the government is not merely a passive conduit for expression ... but is a participant.\").  The Board has not, however, compelled any student to hear or receive the religious message of the Bible.  The Bibles are not distributed in the formal classroom setting, are not part of classroom activities, and are not part of the schools' curriculum.  No student is required or even encouraged to pick up a Bible, much less to read one.  In fact, both school employees and the private citizens organizing the Bible display are affirmatively forbidden from, in any way, pressuring or even encouraging students to take Bibles.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "Of course, the very fact that the Bibles are available may be thought to convey a religious message to Upshur County students--one which students may inadvertently and involuntarily receive if they walk through the particular area in which the Bibles are displayed.  Appellants argue that this message, at least, must be attributed to the government because the state effectively compels students to receive the message by compelling their school attendance.  However, this message, too--if received at all--is received during \"noninstructional time,\" when students are in the hall or library outside of the structured classroom setting.  Mergens, 496 U.S. at 251, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality).  Moreover, the Supreme Court has never held that the mere fact that private religious speech occurs during school hours is sufficient to render it state speech.  Indeed, the Court implicitly rejected this suggestion in Mergens when it treated the speech of religious clubs at a high school as private religious expression, despite the fact that the official school recognition of the clubs mandated by the Court's opinion would guarantee the religious clubs \"access to the school newspaper, bulletin boards, the public address system, and the annual Club Fair.\"  Id. at 247, 250-51, 110 S.Ct. 2356.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "Undoubtedly, the distribution of the school newspaper, student viewing of school bulletin boards, and announcements over the public address system about official club activities all occurred during school hours.  Nevertheless, the Mergens plurality and Justices Kennedy and Scalia in concurrence were apparently neither troubled nor swayed by Justice Marshall's concern that \"[t]he comprehensiveness of [this access] highlight[ed] the Establishment Clause dangers posed by\" conferring official school recognition on high school religious clubs.  Id. at 268, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "The imposition on a student from seeing a privately sponsored table of Bibles in the hallway during one day of the school year is, we are satisfied, no greater than that from seeing signs advertising a religious club on the school's bulletin boards or hearing broadcasts about the clubs over the public address system every day, and the argument for attributing the religious speech to the government is no greater in the former situation than in the latter.  The only message fairly attributable to the government in either case is that private speech will be allowed in the forum on a nondiscriminatory basis.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "Second, appellants argue that Upshur County schools are not public forums for private speakers, but are in fact \"tightly controlled nonforum[s]\" to which the Board allows access on a discretionary basis only to speech that it deems age appropriate, not harmful to students, and not disruptive to the school environment.  Appellants' Brief at 19.  Consequently, appellants contend, all of the speech allowed in the Upshur schools has been approved or \"endorsed\" by the Board, reflects the Board's view of what is appropriate for students to hear, and, as a result, becomes--in some sense--the Board's speech.  See id. at 19, 33. We cannot accept this argument that the mere fact that the school, quite properly, retains the prerogative to exclude from its halls speech that threatens its educational mission means either that the Bible sponsors speak for the Board or that the Board is fostering the mistaken impression that they do.\n",

      "The government need not be administering a \"public forum\" or even a \"limited public forum\" as those terms are understood in free speech jurisprudence in order for it to allow private religious expression on a neutral basis without violating the Establishment Clause.  See, e.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 391-93, 395, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (declining to decide whether school facilities were a \"public forum\" or a \"nonpublic forum\" because, in either event, the schools were required by the Free Speech Clause to allow religious groups to use those facilities on equal terms and providing such equal access would not violate the Establishment Clause);  Widmar, 454 U.S. at 267, 102 S.Ct. 269 (holding that a university could not discriminate against religious speech in a \"generally open\" forum);  Mergens, 496 U.S. at 241-42, 246-48, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality) (holding that even though the school might not be the kind of \"limited public forum\" recognized in Widmar, it was a \"limited open forum\" as defined by Congress under the Equal Access Act and the school was thus required to allow religious clubs and could do so without violating the Establishment Clause).\n",

Like the Board in this case, the school district in Mergens did not have a written policy governing the formation of student clubs, but, in practice, it allowed those clubs whose \"goals and objectives [were] consistent with school board policies and with the school district's 'Mission and Goals'--a broadly worded 'blueprint' that expresses the district's commitment to teaching academic, physical, civic, and personal skills and values.\"  Id. at 232, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality).\n",

      "The plaintiffs in Mergens contended that because the clubs were obviously \"an integral part of [the school's] educational mission, official recognition of [a religious club] would effectively incorporate religious activities into the school's official program, endorse participation in the religious club, and provide the club with an official platform to proselytize other students.\"  Id. at 247-48, 110 S.Ct. 2356. Justice Marshall, joined by Justice Brennan, agreed that, because the \"school's message with respect to its existing clubs [was] not one of toleration but one of endorsement,\" id. at 265, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment), the school was required to take special steps to \"fully dissociate itself from [the proposed religious] club's religious speech and avoid appearing to sponsor or endorse the club's goals,\" id. at 270. Justice Marshall would have required the school either to \"entirely discontinue encouraging student participation in clubs and clarify that the clubs are not instrumentally related to the school's overall mission\" or \"to continue its general endorsement of those student clubs that did not engage in controversial speech,\" but to \"affirmatively disclaim[ ] any endorsement of the Christian club,\" id.\n",

      "However, a majority of the Court in Mergens unmistakably rejected the plaintiffs' and Justice Marshall's position, and held that it would not violate the Establishment Clause for the school to allow religious clubs without changing its existing policy.  See Mergens, 496 U.S. at 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality);  id. at 260-62, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Kennedy, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Certainly, to allow religious clubs under that policy, the school in Mergens would have to find, implicitly at least, that student participation in religious activities is consistent with the school's view of appropriate student character development.  Cf. id. at 261, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (\"I should think it inevitable that a public high school 'endorses' a religious club, in a commonsense use of the term, if the club happens to be one of many activities that the school permits students to choose in order to further the development of their intellect and character in an extracurricular setting.\").  Nevertheless, as Justice Kennedy explained, \"no constitutional violation occurs if the school's action is based upon a recognition of the fact that membership in a religious club is one of many permissible ways for a student to further his or her own personal enrichment.\"  Id.\n",

      "Similarly in this case, the Board's decision that religious speech is one of many kinds of speech that is consistent with the schools' educational mission and that is appropriate for students to hear if they so choose does not evince the favoritism of religion that the Establishment Clause condemns.  Rather, to require the Board to exclude religious literature as such from the forum it has created to further the schools' educational mission by exposing the county's students to a variety of age appropriate private speech would evince the hostility toward religious speech that the Establishment Clause does not require and that the Free Exercise and Free Speech Clauses forbid.  See, e.g., id. at 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality) (\"The Establishment Clause does not license government to treat religion and those who teach or practice it, simply by virtue of their status as such, as subversive of American ideals and therefore subject to unique disabilities.\")  (quoting McDaniel v.

Capitol Square, 115 S.Ct. at 2448-49 (plurality).  The record is devoid of any evidence, however, that the Board has applied its forum standards in a manner that discriminates in favor of Bibles or against other religious materials or non- or anti-religious materials.

      "Despite all of appellants' broad arguments to the contrary, appellants themselves concede, as they must, that the Upshur County schools could, as a general matter, permit private distribution of religious materials pursuant to a neutral, open access policy because \"[a]n open access policy 'does not confer any imprimatur of State approval on religious sects or practices' ... because the forum is available to a broad class of nonreligious as well as religious speakers.\" Appellants' Reply Brief at 20 (quoting Appellees' Brief at 35);  see also Appellants' Brief at 38 (\"If ... the Board had requests from a wide spectrum of private groups wanting to make mass distributions of free books to students, then it might be able legitimately to decide to accommodate those requests, including requests from religious groups to distribute religious materials.\").  Because the Board has, in fact, adopted such a neutral, equal access policy, appellants' case against the Board's decision to allow passive distribution of religious materials reduces to the single, factual assertion that Christian religious speech is dominating and will always dominate the Upshur County school forums.  See Appellants' Brief at 29-33.  According to appellants, this alleged domination means that \"even if the Upshur County Board has a policy that sa[ys] any private groups or citizens [can] distribute their books to the county's school children, that policy would still violate the Establishment Clause,\" because the only groups who have taken advantage of the equal access policy and are likely to take advantage of it in the future are Christians who want to make Bibles available.

Capitol Square, 115 S.Ct. at 2454 (O'Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Even assuming, however, that a neutral government policy of equal access may be converted into government favoritism toward religion if religious groups are the only speakers who choose to use the forum, we doubt that the passive distribution of Bibles on a single day during the year, when other material is distributed freely and actively throughout the year, could ever constitute impermissible domination of a forum, even in the absence of other speech similar to the Bible.  But, in any event, appellants' argument that the Bible or other religious speech will dominate Upshur County's forums lacks factual support in the record and is both premature and speculative.\n",

      "Appellants all but concede not only that there is a sufficiently vigorous exchange of informational announcements and pamphlets in the Upshur County schools that the schools could allow distribution of religious materials of a \"similar\" character, but also that the schools would risk unconstitutionally discriminating against religious speech were they to exclude such religious materials.  See Appellants' Reply Brief at 9 (noting that the schools could encounter constitutional \"difficulties if they refused to distribute 'religious' materials that were analogous to informational announcements by the scouts, 4-H, or the Little League\").  Thus, appellants' argument that Christian religious speech is dominating the Upshur county school forums depends on their characterization of passive Bible distribution as a radically different form of speech than has historically occurred in the Upshur forums.  Appellants argue that \"youth activities groups--the scouts, 4-H, and Little League\" and \"their literature are so dramatically different from a coalition of churches (or of just private citizens) handing out Bibles that they cannot possibly provide an antidote for the religious message of the defendants' action in permitting the Bible distribution.\" Appellants' Reply Brief at 4. Even indulging appellants' intimation that private religious speech in a generally open school forum is a poison in need of \"antidote,\" we are not persuaded that the difference between books, on the one hand, and pamphlets on the other, is of constitutional moment.  Nor do we understand how the character of the private speaker is relevant to our analysis.\n",

      "Moreover, and perhaps most important for resolution of the particular case before us, even if there is a constitutionally significant difference between Bible distribution and distribution of the type of literature previously made available in the Upshur schools, appellants' argument would nonetheless be premature.  The Board only recently clarified its 1989 policy so as to open the Upshur County school forums to a much broader spectrum of speech--including religious and political speech--than traditionally has had access to the Upshur County schools, and it was only during the process leading to this clarification that the Board actually affirmed that the Upshur County schools are \"open forum[s]\" that welcome a wide variety of private speech.  We cannot hold that the Board's policy of providing equal forum access to private speakers violates the Establishment Clause simply because the first speaker in the forum happens to deliver a religious message, any more than we could hold that the Equal Access Act sustained in Mergens would be unconstitutional as applied to the approval of a religious club simply because it was the first to apply for recognition under a school policy allowing students to establish official, noncurricular clubs.  Any such holding would exhibit an antipathy toward religious speech both at odds with our religious heritage and forbidden by our Constitution.\n",

However, this is precisely the case where there is every reason to believe that the future will not necessarily resemble the past.  The Board's clarification of its equal access policy is relatively recent and has been under legal attack almost from its inception.  Appellants filed this suit less than three months after the December 1994 policy interpretation and little more than a week after Superintendent Westfall first met with McDaniels to arrange a date for making the Bibles available.

      "As should be evident from the foregoing discussion, we are convinced that the Board has neither coerced any student to participate in a religious activity nor impermissibly \"endorsed\" religion by allowing, under the circumstances described, the privately sponsored Bible displays for a single day during the year.  \"The inquiry with respect to coercion must be whether the government imposes pressure upon a student to participate in a religious activity.\"  Mergens, 496 U.S. at 261, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (emphasis added).  As we discussed earlier, the Board's action does not raise the specter of official coercion because neither the Board nor any other school employee will require or even encourage any student to pick up a Bible, much less to read one, and the Board has also expressly forbidden the private sponsors of the tables from imposing upon any student to take a Bible.  The Bibles are made available outside of the formal classroom setting and students will be able to ignore or simply walk past the table set up in the hall or library--presumably without even calling any attention to that choice.  Thus, no student will be put to the choice of \"participating [in a religious exercise], with all that implies, or protesting.\"  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992).

In so holding, we are fully mindful of the unrivaled symbolic power of the Bible.  We also recognize that there is an almost irresistible visceral temptation to raise the constitutional hurdle proportionately to the power of this text.  But ultimately we are convinced that the power of a given religious text must be irrelevant to the constitutional analysis and that we cannot yield to the temptation to adjust the constitutional calculus depending upon the content of the particular religious material at issue.  The Bible is no less deserving of the Constitution's protection than any other text of faith.

Appellants even concede that, today, the Upshur County School Board may constitutionally permit private groups to offer the Bible and other religious materials in open forums of the Upshur County schools, because the imprimatur of the state is not conferred upon a religious message that is imparted by a private party in such forums.  And appellants acknowledge, as the district court specifically found, that the County has invited private speakers into its public schools.  Essentially, appellants' only argument is that Upshur County does not have a policy of open access that sufficiently \"diffuses the religious impact\" of the Bibles because the only persons who, thus far, have availed themselves of the School Board's new policy allowing the distribution of religious and political material are persons who wish to offer the Bible.

Those critical, uncontroverted facts are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "73\n",
      "First, and indisputably, the Bible was and is the only sectarian religious text--indeed, the only non-curricular book of any sort--that the Upshur County School Board has ever approved for distribution in the County schools.  The Board adopted its 1989 policy in reaction to an in-school Bible distribution by the Gideons.  Superintendent Lynn Westfall (a thirty-two-year veteran of the Upshur County schools) testified that after the Gideons \"went into the classroom[s], talked to the students, and then handed the Bibles to the students,\" the Board approved its policy prohibiting the distribution of religious materials \"advocating a particular religion, denomination, or the beliefs thereof\" in the schools.  A Board member further explained that the Board considered the Gideons' distribution \"a problem\" because \"children were being coerced or pressured into accepting things.\" Moreover, when the Board adopted its 1989 policy it made no distinction between permitting groups to distribute religious materials (including Bibles) and permitting them to make available religious materials.  (Similarly, I make no distinction herein between \"distributing\" and \"making available.\") The Board followed that policy--without exception--until it sanctioned the Bible distribution now at issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "74\n",
      "Second, after adoption of the 1989 policy, only four private groups distributed literature in the schools prior to the challenged Bible distribution:  the Little League, the Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, and the 4-H Club.  (Some twenty years earlier, the Women's Christian Temperance Union had distributed some literature in the schools, but that distribution had not been repeated in recent times.) These four groups, recognized by the Superintendent as \"quasi-educational,\" \"[y]outh service, youth activity-oriented groups,\" distributed \"informational announcements and pamphlets\" regarding membership and activities.  Although the public schools in Upshur County and throughout the state commonly receive requests to distribute Bibles, the four groups granted access neither requested nor received permission to distribute Bibles, sectarian religious texts, books espousing theological or religious principles, or, in fact, books of any kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "75\n",
      "Third, the circumstances leading to the Board's decision to permit the challenged Bible distribution remain uncontroverted.  In August 1994, Reverend Eddie McDaniels, a local minister and radio talk show host, accompanied by a businessman and two state senators, asked to place Bibles on tables in public schools--to \"make them available\" to students.  The group argued that \"making the Bibles available\" did not violate the Board's formal policy barring \"distribution\" of sectarian religious materials.  Reverend McDaniels indicated to the Superintendent (who in turn reported to the Board) that \"some of the people involved feel strongly enough about this issue that they may pursue it legally.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "76\n",
      "The Superintendent sought counsel from the Board's attorney, who advised that, although existing law did not \"specifically prohibit\" a private group from making the Bibles available, the Board should deny the request and adhere to its existing policy.  The Superintendent reported this advice to the Board, along with his opinion that the Board should \"stand[ ] firmly behind[the] existing policy,\" because \"at the time that the Board adopted [the] policy, both distribution and [the making] availab[le] of Bibles were prohibited.\" In late October, the Superintendent shared the research with Reverend McDaniels' group, and suggested that the group distribute the Bibles through the Fellowship of Student Athletes, \"a voluntary student group that meets off school hours,\" which, like other student clubs in the schools, could freely make Bibles (or other religious or non-religious literature) available to their fellow students.  Reverend McDaniels' group rejected this suggestion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "77\n",
      "After meeting with the Superintendent, Reverend McDaniels attempted to convince each member of the Board to permit the distribution of Bibles throughout the school system.  He informed them that one of the members of his congregation, Tom Shaw, planned to publish a statement in the local paper urging citizens to vote against the upcoming school tax levy unless the Board sanctioned the Bible distribution.  In exchange for a commitment to consider the distribution at their next Board meeting, Reverend McDaniels stated that he would try to halt publication of Shaw's statement.  In response, one Board member suggested that the group distribute the Bibles through the parent-teacher organization, or at grocery stores, other business places, or at after school events.  Reverend McDaniels again rejected these suggestions and the idea of distributing Bibles in the churches, explaining that \"there are people who do not go to church that he could probably find in school.\"\n",

As the Superintendent acknowledged, the Board minutes from that meeting do not contain any suggestion that religious materials other than Bibles would be permitted in the Upshur County schools.

Specifically, the Board president conceded that no member of the Board or Administration ever mentioned--in all of the discussions prior to granting permission for the Bible distribution--that the 1989 policy \"was going to be adopted, changed or interpreted in order to provide a broad forum for the free flow of ideas.\" He further testified that he had never \"directed\" the Superintendent \"to bring a broad public forum into the schools of Upshur County,\" and during his tenure on the Board (since 1982), he had never suggested that \"it might be a good idea to create a broad public forum\" in the schools, nor did he recall other Board members making such a suggestion.\n",

That finding was clearly correct.  Public schools do not by nature possess the attributes of a public forum open for \"indiscriminate use\" by the citizenry or some segment thereof.  See Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 267-70, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988).

But even if Reverend McDaniels' group did possess such a right, the Board could not constitutionally grant the group access to the schools if the distribution offended the Establishment Clause.

Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), the Supreme Court enunciated a three-part test to determine whether government action violates the Establishment Clause.  To satisfy the prohibition against conduct that establishes religion, government action must:  (1) have a secular purpose;  (2) have as its \"primary effect ... one that neither advances nor inhibits religion\";  and (3) \"not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.\"  Id. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105 (internal quotation marks omitted).  A majority of the Court has recently reaffirmed the importance of Lemon 's \"purpose\" prong, and concluded that its \"effect\" and \"entanglement\" prongs rightly comprise a single inquiry.

Noting that the Board's 1989 policy enunciated its commitment to the \"unrestricted pursuit of knowledge,\" the majority implies that the Bible distribution grew naturally from that policy.  See ante at 279-81. But the uncontroverted facts offer no support for this theory.  The Board adopted its 1989 policy, expressly barring the distribution of religious materials \"advocating a particular religion, denomination, or the beliefs thereof,\" because of its concern that the previous Bible distribution (by the Gideons) resulted in coercion of students.  The Board steadfastly followed that policy during the subsequent five years, and ultimately permitted the contested Bible distribution only in response to political strong-arming and threatened legal action, and only after initially deciding to stand by its nondistribution policy.\n",

Although on occasion the Court has considered the trial testimony of those responsible for a challenged state action as to their motivation, see, e.g., Wallace, 472 U.S. at 57, 105 S.Ct. 2479, that practice has been criticized within the Court, see id. at 77, 105 S.Ct. 2479 (O'Connor, J., concurring);  id. at 86-87, 105 S.Ct. 2479 (Burger, C.J., dissenting).  Perhaps more important, the Court has never held that self-serving, after-the-fact testimony about motivation can establish a particular secular purpose when the government action itself and the events that led to it compel a different conclusion.  After all, the stated purpose underlying governmental action must be \"sincere and not a sham.\"  Edwards, 482 U.S. at 586-87, 107 S.Ct. 2573. In this case, as one of the amici filing a brief in support of the Board notes, \"Board members admitted at trial that the Board did not reach its decision for educational purposes but did so because of community pressure.\" Amicus Curiae Brief of Texas Justice Foundation at 11 (emphasis added).\n",

      "The undisputed facts thus make the purpose inquiry closer than the majority suggests.  The record undeniably demonstrates that Reverend McDaniels' group--who wanted to distribute a particular version of the Bible in the public schools \"because that's where the kids are\"--sought to \"advance religion,\" and that the Board voted to permit the Bible distribution only after that group lobbied and petitioned the Board, and worked to defeat the school tax.

The district court held it does not, Peck, 941 F.Supp. at 1473-74 n. 7;  however, the parents who challenge the Bible distribution argue that the Board necessarily embraced the religious biases of Reverend McDaniels' group.  They maintain that \"when the Board acted solely with the design of appeasing the group ... the religious purpose of the group became the religious purpose of the Board.\" Brief of Appellants at 48.  In support of this proposition the parents cite Palmore v. Sidoti, 466 U.S. 429, 432-34, 104 S.Ct. 1879, 80 L.Ed.2d 421 (1984), in which the Supreme Court held, in an equal protection context, that government cannot act to give effect to private biases.\n",

As already noted above, I believe Reverend McDaniels' group had no right to distribute Bibles in the Upshur County schools.  See supra § I.B. This conclusion does not, however, require that a court shut its eyes to the record.  Reverend McDaniels' group asserted such a right and threatened suit to establish it.  At the Board's request, its attorney researched the question and concluded that, although the distribution might cause Establishment Clause concerns, no law \"specifically prohibited\" it.  The undisputed facts demonstrate that the Board's motivation stemmed at least in part from an aversion to a loss of needed revenue for the schools, from the familiar desire to avoid a lawsuit, and from an (erroneous) concern for accommodating the group's asserted right to access the schools.  This undoubtedly satisfies the secular purpose criterion and the district court did not err in so finding.\n",

In a truly open, public forum with a wide array of messages, a greater expectation exists that citizens will understand government does not endorse any particular message--that the government acts neutrally.  Conversely, in a nonpublic forum, where government exerts enormous control over the content of expression (and where the spectrum of private speech is circumscribed), it is far more likely that citizens will perceive a message of government endorsement, or lack of neutrality.\n",

However, the Board does not contend that the Bible distribution here was instituted or carried out as part of the school curriculum.  As the majority proclaims, \"[t]he Bibles are not distributed in the formal classroom setting, are not part of classroom activities, and are not part of the school's curriculum.\"  Ante at 282.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "126\n",
      "I recognize that people of good will may nonetheless wish that the public schools would instill in students veneration for the Bible and the principles it espouses.  But the Supreme Court has specifically concluded that when, as here, privately financed religious expression in the public schools \"serves no [ ] educational function\" its only possible effect is \"to induce the schoolchildren to read, meditate upon, perhaps to venerate and obey.\"  Stone, 449 U.S. at 42, 101 S.Ct. 192. The Court has held that \"[h]owever desirable this might be as a matter of private devotion it is not a permissible state objective under the Establishment Clause.\"  Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "127\n",
      "Third, a reasonable, informed observer would know that the Board consistently operated the school system as a nonpublic forum, retaining the authority to selectively deny access to inappropriate or harmful groups and affording access only to a few youth activity groups so that they could distribute informational pamphlets.  No amount of obfuscation can change the fact that this case differs dramatically from the cases on which the majority so heavily relies.  In those cases, the government granted many groups access to a forum, making the forum indeed \"open,\" and then denied access to a similarly situated group solely on the basis of its religious perspective.  See, e.g., Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 2515-17, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995) (when a state university provided a \"limited public forum\" to 118 student groups--15 of which were \"student news ... or media groups\"--it could not exclude a student journal solely because of the journal's \"religious editorial viewpoint\");  Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 393-95, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (when public \"property had repeatedly been used by a wide variety of private organizations\" likely creating a \"limited public forum,\" the government could not deny access to a similarly situated group \"solely because\" of the \"religious standpoint\" of its speech);  Widmar, 454 U.S. at 273-274, 102 S.Ct. 269 (when a university routinely made its facilities available for meetings of \"over 100 recognized student groups,\" creating an \"open\" \"public forum,\" it could not deny access to another recognized student group on account of the group's religious perspective alone).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "128\n",
      "In contrast, between 1989 and 1994 the Board allowed only four private youth activity groups access to the schools to distribute informational literature.  Moreover, as the parents note, \"nothing in the record[ ] indicate[s] that any of[those] groups sought access to the schools with any degree of regularity, let alone to a degree that would create a lively exchange of ideas, information, or concepts.\" Reply Brief at 4. Just as granting access to a wide variety of groups decreases the likelihood that a message of endorsement is conveyed, see Rosenberger, 115 S.Ct. at 2527 (O'Connor, J. concurring), so too granting access to a few groups substantially increases that likelihood.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "129\n",
      "Fourth, a reasonable observer would fully comprehend that the Board contravened its established policy and practice and permitted the Bible distribution to accommodate those who wanted Bibles in the schools, not to establish an \"open\" forum.  That is, a reasonable observer would know that the Board voted to \"instruct[ ] the Superintendent to meet with Reverend McDaniels to arrange a day for making Bibles available\" in the public schools only after (1) the Board initially decided to affirm its 1989 policy barring all sectarian religious materials, (2) Reverend McDaniels heavily lobbied the Board to permit the Bible distribution, (3) one of Reverend McDaniels' congregants urged Upshur County voters \"to withhold our taxes\" unless and until the Board permitted the Bible distribution, (4) the school tax levy failed, (5) numerous Protestant churchgoers petitioned the Board to make Bibles available, and (6) the 500-plus crowd at the December meeting urged the Board to approve the Bible distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "130\n",
      "Conversely, such an observer would also realize that, as the Board president testified, no one--including Board members--ever urged that the Board establish a broad, open forum, and when it permitted the challenged Bible distribution the Board did not think it was adopting, changing, or interpreting its policy to create such a forum.  In fact, even after permitting the Bible distribution, the Board retained discretion to withhold access to inappropriate speakers.  Thus, contrary to the majority's suggestion, in permitting the Bible distribution the Board did not create a \"newly established open forum.\"  Ante at 287. In admitting Reverend McDaniels' group, the Board acted, as the government did in Grumet, 114 S.Ct. at 2491, in a sui generis manner, which \"gives reason for concern whether the benefit received ... will [be] provide[d] equally to other religious (and nonreligious) groups.\" For this reason, as in Grumet, \"we have no assurance that the next similarly situated group\" will receive the same treatment.  Id. And much like Grumet, \"the historical context in this case\" does not \"furnish us with any reason to suppose\" that those seeking to distribute Bibles in the schools represent \"merely one in a series\" of groups seeking this access.  Id. Rather, a reasonable observer would know that the history of the Upshur County schools conclusively demonstrates that the proponents of Bibles are the only private groups that have ever sought to place religious texts in the public schools, see supra § I.A., and the demographics of heavily Protestant Upshur County powerfully suggest that no other religious group will ever seek to follow their lead.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "131\n",
      "Finally, a reasonable, informed observer would be aware that the Bible distribution took place during a regular school day when state law mandates school attendance and where the susceptibility of children to the \"subtle coercive pressure[s]\" of government and their peers is \"most pronounced.\"  Lee, 505 U.S. at 592, 112 S.Ct. 2649;  see also Edwards, 482 U.S. at 583-84, 107 S.Ct. 2573. The Seventh Circuit, in holding another Bible distribution unconstitutional, noted that \"[t]he only reason the Gideons find schools a more amenable point of solicitation than, say, a church or local mall, is ease of distribution, since all children are compelled by law to attend school and the vast majority attend public schools.\"  Berger v. Rensselaer Cent. Sch. Corp., 982 F.2d. 1160, 1167 (7th Cir.1993).  Both Reverend McDaniels and the newspaper statement of his follower voiced precisely this sentiment.  See supra at 291 (\"Schools are the best place to distribute [Bibles] because that's where the kids are.\").  As Justice Kennedy recently explained for the Court, \"[w]hat to most believers may seem nothing more than a reasonable request that the nonbeliever respect their religious practices, in a school context may appear to the nonbeliever or dissenter to be an attempt to employ the machinery of the State to enforce a religious orthodoxy.\"  Lee, 505 U.S. at 592, 112 S.Ct. 2649. He noted, citing several scholarly sources, that \"[r]esearch in psychology supports the common assumption that adolescents are often susceptible to pressure from their peers towards conformity, and that the influence is strongest in matters of social convention.\"  Id. at 593-94, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (emphasis added).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "132\n",
      "Of course, many of the children whom the majority holds constitutionally subject to the Bible distribution are not even \"adolescents.\" The majority reaches its extraordinary holding as to these young children by employing an analysis, the neutrality test, see ante at 279-85, that simply does not apply in this nonpublic forum.  See supra at 295-97. When the majority does briefly acknowledge the proper endorsement test analysis, ante at 284-85, 287-88, it ignores the history and context of the Bible distribution--all of which would have been apparent to any reasonable observer--and concludes that all Upshur County students except those in grades 1 to 4 \"are particularly capable of recognizing\" the distinction \"between a school's equal access policy and school sponsorship of religion.\"  Ante  at 287 & n. *.  This conclusion wholly ignores the youth of the middle school and junior high school children subjected to the Bible distribution.  Neither the Supreme Court nor Congress have ever suggested, let alone concluded, that children this young have the capacity to discern whether school authorities effectively sponsor religion.  Indeed, the legislative history of the Equal Access Act at issue in Mergens indicates that Congress specifically choose to avoid its application to children of this age.  The original legislative proposal applied to both \"public elementary and secondary school[s],\" S.Rep. No. 98-357, at 38 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2348, 2384, but the law enacted by Congress applies only to secondary schools, see  20 U.S.C.A. § 4071(a) (West 1990).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "133\n",
      "Moreover, although Congress has \"rejected the argument that high school students are likely to confuse an equal access policy with state sponsorship of religion,\" Mergens, 496 U.S. at 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (plurality opinion), Upshur County high school students did not confront a choice between an \"equal access policy and school sponsorship of religion.\"  Ante at 287. Let me be clear:  no \"equal access policy\" existed in the Upshur County Schools.  Rather, students observed an established and consistently followed policy that permitted no  private sectarian religious speech in the public schools, a policy that allowed private speech only from four youth groups distributing informational pamphlets (hardly the \"vigorous exchange\" characterized by the majority, ante at 285), a policy that reserved discretion to the school administrators over the \"appropriateness\" and \"harmfulness\" of materials, and a policy from which the School Board deviated only after a well organized effort headed by a clergyman managed to defeat a school tax levy.  Reasonable, informed observers confronted with these facts could only conclude that the School Board had endorsed religion.  As in Allegheny County, \"[n]o viewer could reasonably think that [the Bibles] occupy this location\"--here a table inside a public school during mandatory school hours--\"without the support and approval of the government.\"  492 U.S. at 599-600, 109 S.Ct. 3086.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "134\n",
      "The majority's reliance on the fact that the distribution takes place in the hallways as students move from one compulsory class period to another does not alter the balance.  See ante  at 287-88. The Supreme Court has rightly noted that \"[l]aw reaches past formalism.\"  Lee, 505 U.S. at 595, 112 S.Ct. 2649. The State of West Virginia compels students to attend school, not just individual classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "135\n",
      "Indeed, the distribution of Bibles in public schools during periods of mandatory attendance may well amount to coercion just as the short, nondenominational school graduation ceremony prayers in Lee did.  Justices Kennedy and Scalia have noted the difficulty in drawing the \"line between voluntary and coerced participation\" in a secondary school.  Mergens, 496 U.S. at 261-62, 110 S.Ct. 2356 (Kennedy, J., concurring, joined by Scalia, J.).  And the younger the children involved, the more obscure the line becomes.  Here, as in Lee, \"the school district's supervision and control\" of a \"school setting\" succeeded in \"plac[ing] public pressure, as well as peer pressure, on attending students\" to \"signify adherence to the religious expression.\"  505 U.S. at 593-94, 112 S.Ct. 2649. In Lee, the Court held it not \"consistent with the Establishment Clause [to] place primary and secondary school children in this position.\"  Id. at 593, 112 S.Ct. 2649.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "136\n",
      "I appreciate the factual differences between this case and Lee that might lead some to conclude Lee presented a more obvious Establishment Clause violation.  For instance, in Lee, the challenged religious expression was a short nondenominational prayer while here it is distribution of a religious text, and it could be argued that coercive pressures to participate in a religious service exceed those inducing a student to accept a free Bible.  However, in view of the power of the Bible as a tool of religious indoctrination, this argument loses force.  As Justice Brennan has noted, the \"Holy Bible[is] more clearly sectarian\" than \"rather bland\" nondenominational prayers.  See Schempp, 374 U.S. at 267, 83 S.Ct. 1560 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Devout and well meaning members of the school community surely might bring more pressure on a student to participate in a Bible distribution than in a nondenominational graduation prayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "137\n",
      "Furthermore, other factual differences clearly indicate that the Bible distribution constitutes the more obvious Establishment Clause violation.  For example, Bibles were made available during an entire school day, much longer than the two minutes of nondenominational prayer at issue in Lee. 505 U.S. at 594, 112 S.Ct. 2649.  (Similarly, the majority's intimation that limiting the Bible distribution to a single day somehow cures any constitutional concern, ante at 281, 282, 285, 287-88 ignores the fact that although the graduation prayers in Lee subjected the students to religious activity only once or twice over the entire course of their elementary and secondary school careers, the Supreme Court squarely invalidated them.) Moreover, while most of the high school graduation ceremonies in Lee were \"conducted away from the school,\" 505 U.S. at 583, 112 S.Ct. 2649, the Bibles were distributed in the schools.  And, whereas the parties in Lee stipulated that \"attendance at graduation ceremonies [wa]s voluntary,\" id., no one disputes that public school attendance is mandatory.  Thus, the Bible distribution manifests the very element--\"legal coercion to attend school,\"--that the dissent in Lee found critically absent.  Id. at 643, 112 S.Ct. 2649 (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "138\n",
      "Before concluding, I must briefly address the majority's suggestions that the restrictions, principally a disclaimer, placed on the Bible distribution render it constitutional.  Ante at 280-81, 281-82, 285-86, 287-88. In some situations a disclaimer can help to prevent a perception of government endorsement, but an observer must be able to read and understand a disclaimer if it is to have any effect.  It remains unclear whether the young children here could read or understand the Board's disclaimer, even if read to them.  Furthermore, no disclaimer can save government action from an Establishment Clause challenge when, as here, \"other indicia of endorsement ... outweigh the mitigating effect of the disclaimer.\"  Id. 515 U.S. at 793-94 n. 2, 115 S.Ct. at 2462 n. 2 (Souter, J., concurring).  Just as the nearly unanimous Stone Court concluded that a disclaimer was \"not sufficient to avoid conflict with the First Amendment,\" 449 U.S. at 41, 101 S.Ct. 192, the disclaimer in this case simply cannot eliminate the many indications of government endorsement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "139\n",
      "Moreover, although I recognize the visceral appeal of holding that the Bible distribution amounts to nothing more than a de minimis constitutional violation, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected precisely this sort of \"de minimis \" contention.  The Court has held that \"[i]t is no defense\" to assert that constitutional violations are \"relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment.\"  Schempp, 374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. 1560;  see also Lee, 505 U.S. at 594, 112 S.Ct. 2649;  Engel, 370 U.S. at 436, 82 S.Ct. 1261. With unmatched eloquence, the Court has explained that \"[t]he breach of neutrality that is today a trickling stream may all too soon become a raging torrent and, in the words of Madison, 'it is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties.' \"  Schempp, 374 U.S. at 225, 83 S.Ct. 1560 (quoting James Madison, Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments ).\n",

      "III.\n",
      "\n",
      "140\n",
      "The ratifiers of the Bill of Rights knew too well the danger posed by state encroachment on religious liberty, and so forbade official actions that favor religion or a particular religious creed.  Government can convey a message of endorsement as well with a blind eye as with a firm voice or a guiding hand.  And, particularly where impressionable school children are involved, government can coerce participation in even nominally voluntary religious activity.  Today's majority chooses to ignore the evident effect of the Board's conduct.  Neither the Establishment Clause nor the jurisprudence interpreting it countenance that result.  I must, therefore, dissent.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "*\n",
      " While we are not convinced that, even in the elementary school context, concerns of coercion or endorsement should be sufficient to constitutionally foreclose the County from implementing a neutral policy designed to accommodate free speech and free exercise interests--especially where, as here, the children's only exposure to the private religious speech is both passive and limited--we are convinced that a majority of the Supreme Court might well believe that these concerns should be and are sufficient in the elementary school context to invalidate such a policy.  We can appreciate fully what might be the Court's thinking in this regard.  In elementary schools, the concerns animating the coercion principle are at their strongest because of the impressionability of young elementary-age children.  Moreover, because children of these ages may be unable to fully recognize and appreciate the difference between government and private speech--a difference that lies at the heart of the neutrality principle--the County's policy could more easily be (mis)perceived as endorsement rather than as neutrality.  Thus, because our obligation as a court of appeals is to reason as we believe the Supreme Court would, we do hold that the School Board's policy is unconstitutional to the extent that it allows the display of Bibles and other religious material in the elementary schools of the County.  Accordingly, to the extent that the district court judgment sustains this aspect of the Upshur County policy, the judgment is reversed\n",

      "Under the Equal Access Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 4071-4074, public school students who wish to pray and study the Bible together after school enjoy the same right to meet in school classrooms as other extracurricular groups. The school can avoid the requirements of the Equal Access Act by prohibiting all \"noncurriculum related\" student groups or by declining federal funding. In this case, a public high school subject to the Act negotiated to impasse with a small group of students who wanted to form an after-school Bible Club. Agreement was reached on every aspect of the club's status and operation, but one. The students insisted on a club charter provision that only Christians could be club officers;  the school refused recognition on the sole ground that this condition violated the school policy prohibiting all student groups from discriminating on the basis of (among other things) religion. The students sued, and moved for a preliminary injunction that would force the school to recognize the club. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Leonard D.

      "Roslyn High School (the \"School\") is a public school serving grades nine through twelve. Located in Roslyn, New York, the School is part of the Roslyn Union Free School District (the \"District\"). The District is governed by a Board of Education (the \"Board\"), which employs a Superintendent to implement its policies.\n",

      "4\n",
      "In September 1993, as Emily Hsu began her senior year at Roslyn High and her brother Timothy entered as a freshman, Emily met with the school's principal, Mark Weyne, to ask if she could form an after-school Christian Bible Club (the \"Club\"). He told her that he would look into it, and referred the matter to the office of the District Superintendent. In November 1993, the Assistant Superintendent for Curriculum and Instruction, Marilyn Silverman, met with Emily and Jane Shin (another Roslyn High student interested in forming a Bible club) \"to obtain additional information about the club.\" Emily was told that the Board would discuss the Club at a December 2 meeting. Emily, Jane, and a third interested student, Johnny Whang, attended the meeting. After Emily and Jane explained their proposal to the Board, the Board had a \"broad ranging discussion of the issue\" and postponed final decision. Emily claims that during that discussion:  a Board member stated that School officials did not want the Club to meet, but that they were legally required to grant the Club access;  a second Board member suggested that the District should stop accepting federal funds in order to avoid the mandate of the Equal Access Act;  and the Board indicated that it was tabling the proposal so that it could study in greater depth the consequences of forgoing federal money.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "Several weeks after the Board meeting, Emily and Jane met with Silverman and Roslyn High's new principal, Howard Rubin.

      "In early January 1994, Emily delivered to Silverman the Club's proposed constitution. Article I stated that the \"Walking on Water\" club would be open to all Roslyn High School students \"regardless of race, color, age, religion, sex, national origin, or physical handicap.\" Article II stated that the Club would provide \"a time of praise for students to gather in Christian fellowship,\" which was defined as a time \"when Christians gather to praise God ...\" (the \"Christian fellowship provision\"). Fellowship would be provided \"in the form of singspiration[, that is,] singing inspirational music which exalts the Lord Jesus Christ....\"  Article III described the Club's weekly, hour-long meetings. Meetings would open and close with a prayer. The first half of the meetings would consist of \"singspiration.\" The second half might include more prayer, more \"singspiration,\" testimonies from students about their belief in Jesus Christ, guest speakers, skits, games, or Bible study. According to the Hsus, these activities were to be consistent with the Club's overarching goal of spending an hour of spirituality together \"to praise God.\"  Article IV listed potential projects for the Club, including volunteer community service, charitable fund raising, and picnics.\n",

Five officer positions were created:  President, Vice-President, Secretary, Music Coordinator, and Activities Counselor. The President would be \"responsible for the overall spiritual direction and oversight of the Bible club ... [and] the spiritual content of the regular weekly meetings,\" and the Vice-President would help perform these responsibilities. The Secretary would take the minutes and do the accounting. Both the Vice-President and Secretary were to \"be prepared to perform the presidential functions\" in the President's absence. The Music Coordinator would select the \"praise and worship songs\" and \"lead the singing and worship of the Lord\" at \"Singspiration time.\" The Activities Coordinator would plan the community service work, charitable fundraising, and picnics. All officers had to be prepared \"to open or close a meeting with prayer or to lead a Bible study,\" and \"to give testimony to the life-changing presence of Jesus Christ in his/her life.\" Article V required that all of these officers be \"professed Christians either through baptism or confirmation\" (the \"leadership provision\"). That provision is the bone of contention here.\n",

They explained to the students that two provisions of the Club's constitution were unacceptable:  the provision defining Christian fellowship as a gathering of \"Christians,\" and the provision limiting officers to \"professed Christians.\" Emily responded by crossing out the word \"Christians\" in the Christian fellowship provision, and writing in the more inclusionary word, \"people.\" Emily was more unbending as to the School's second objection, however, and wrote the following sentences in the margin of the leadership provision:  \"All members eligible to vote will also be eligible to run for offices. Accepting Jesus Christ as savior is a requirement for all officers.\"  (The second sentence thus imposed an eligibility requirement not implicit in the first sentence.)\n",

The first statement prohibits the Board from discriminating against any student \"on the basis of race, color, national origin, creed or religion, marital status, sex, age or handicapping condition,\" in providing \"access to ... student activities.\" The second statement requires that the District\n",

Only if the Club's officers are Christian, say the Hsus, will the Club \"serve the function we desire for it to serve.\" Because of their belief that the leadership provision is an integral part of the Club, they did not think it meaningful to form a club based on the School's conditional recognition, and have therefore treated the School's resolution as tantamount to non-recognition.

On February 21, 1995, the district court issued a thorough opinion denying the request for a preliminary injunction and denying the defendants' motion.  876 F.Supp. 445 (E.D.N.Y.1995). Rejecting the Hsus' Equal Access Act claim, the court held that the School \"appears to have satisfied its obligation under the Act,\" id. at 456, by letting the Club meet \"on the same basis\" and \"subject to the same terms and conditions\" as other clubs.  Id. at 454. Those \"terms and conditions\" (that is, the nondiscrimination policy) were reasonable, said the court, because they were \"aimed at ... protecting the well-being of all students by ensuring equal and nondiscriminatory access of all students to student clubs.\"  Id. at 455. The court concluded both that the nondiscrimination policy on its face did not violate the Establishment Clause, and that the Establishment Clause required that the nondiscrimination policy be applied to the Walking on Water Club, since an exemption for the Club would create an \"unavoidable [ ] risk of excessive entanglement.\"  Id. at 460. In addition, the court held that such an exemption would convey \"a message of exclusion\" and would permit \"discrimination based on religion in the school setting.\" According to the court, this discrimination, like \" 'racial discrimination in education[,] violates a most fundamental national public policy, as well as rights of individuals.' \"  Id. at 459 (quoting Bob Jones Univ. v.

Finally, the court rejected the plaintiffs' free exercise, free speech, and free association claims on the ground that applying the School's nondiscrimination policy to the Club advanced, in the least restrictive manner possible, the School's compelling interest in \"ensur[ing] all other students the right to be free from invidious discrimination in school, ...

      "28\n",
      "It is \"normally appropriate\" to review a district court's preliminary injunction decision under a deferential standard, determining whether the district court has abused its discretion, Thornburgh v. American College, 476 U.S. 747, 755, 106 S.Ct. 2169, 2175-76, 90 L.Ed.2d 779 (1986), rev'd on other grounds, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833, 870, 112 S.Ct. 2791, 2816-17, 120 L.Ed.2d 674 (1992), either by \"an error of law,\" Blum v. Schlegel, 18 F.3d 1005, 1010 (2d Cir.1994) (internal quotations omitted), or by \"applying an incorrect legal standard.\"  Waldman Publishing Corp. v. Landoll, Inc., 43 F.3d 775, 780 (2d Cir.1994). However, the presumption that we review a preliminary injunction decision for \"abuse of discretion\" is \"a rule of orderly judicial administration, not a limit on judicial power.\"  Thornburgh, 476 U.S. at 757, 106 S.Ct. at 2177. The appropriate level of deference afforded to a preliminary injunction decision is \"not inflexible.\"  Id. at 756, 106 S.Ct. at 2176. For instance, we held in Romer v. Green Point Savings Bank, 27 F.3d 12, 16 (2d Cir.1994), that preliminary injunction decisions must undergo \"greater scrutiny\" when they \"effectively award victory in the litigation\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29\n",
      "When a district court's order, albeit in the form of a TRO or preliminary injunction, will finally dispose of the matter in dispute, it is not sufficient for the order to be based on a likelihood of success or balance of hardships ...;  the district court's decision must be correct (insofar as possible on what may be an incomplete record), and appellate review should be plenary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30\n",
      "Id.  And in Thornburgh, the Supreme Court explained why the Third Circuit had been correct to conduct \"plenary review\" of the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "31\n",
      "[I]f a district court's ruling rests solely on a premise as to the applicable rule of law, and the facts are established or of no controlling relevance, that ruling may be reviewed even though the appeal is from the entry of a preliminary injunction.\n",

      "32\n",
      "Id. at 757, 106 S.Ct. at 2177;  see also Blum, 18 F.3d at 1010 (\"abuse of discretion\" standard applies \"[w]here the facts are of controlling relevance\"). Judge Friendly offered a similar explanation in applying \"a broad standard of review\" in Donovan v. Bierwirth, 680 F.2d 263, 270 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1069, 103 S.Ct. 488, 74 L.Ed.2d 631 (1982):\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "There is no real dispute over what did and what did not occur. The quarrel is over the legal standard and its application to facts not seriously in dispute....  We would ill perform our duties by a decision affirming the district court because of limitations on the scope of review....\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34\n",
      "See also Henry J. Friendly, Indiscretion About Discretion, 31 Emory L.J. 747, 777-78 (1982).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35\n",
      "As these cases make clear, deferential review is justified by the circumstances ordinarily accompanying preliminary injunction rulings:  expedited proceedings and untested facts produce tentative rulings with provisional consequences, allowing room for a different ultimate outcome. However, when these circumstances are absent and the district court ruling resembles a final decision on the merits, there is less justification for substantial deference. We therefore consider the nature of the district court's ruling.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "Presented with a preliminary injunction motion, the district court (naturally) decided the substantive issues in that framework. Its decision, however, resembles more closely a grant of summary judgment to the defendants. First, as in Thornburgh and Donovan, \"the facts [we]re established,\" and the only dispute was over the correct legal standard to apply. There is no sign that the factual record needs development or that factual disputes need resolution before the merits of the plaintiffs' claims can be finally decided. The district court expressed no such need at the two-day hearing or in its opinion, and the parties expressed no such need, then or after.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "Second, there is no indication that the district court's consideration of this case was abbreviated by any perceived time constraint, as is common in a preliminary injunction proceeding. The plaintiffs' amended complaint was filed in March 1993, the hearing was held two months later, and the request for \"preliminary\" injunctive relief was denied in February 1994, eleven months later. At that point, Emily Hsu had been a graduate of Roslyn High for eight months, and Timothy Hsu was well into his sophomore year.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "Third, the purpose of the preliminary injunction motion was not the ordinary goal of \"preserv[ing] the relative positions of the parties.\"  Thornburgh, 476 U.S. at 755, 106 S.Ct. at 2175-76. The preliminary injunction motion sought an order requiring the School to recognize the Walking on Water Club on its terms, thus altering the status quo. Moreover, the injunction was likely to give these plaintiffs the only opportunity that the courts could likely afford for them to participate in the Club.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "In these ways, the district court's decision, explained by a decisive and categorical opinion, resembled a definitive ruling on the merits of the plaintiffs' claims.5  As in Romer, the district court's decision \"effectively award[ed] victory in the litigation.\" And as in Thornburgh and Donovan, the district court's resolution of the case hinged not on what the facts were--since the material ones are undisputed--but on how the law should be applied. As a result, our review of the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction is plenary.\n",
      "\n",
      "III. The Hsus' Rights\n",
      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "A preliminary injunction is granted if the party seeking the relief establishes two elements:  first, the party will suffer \"irreparable harm\" if the injunction is denied;  second, either the moving party is likely to succeed on the merits, or there are \"sufficiently serious questions going to the merits\" and the \"balance of hardships tip[s] decidedly\" its way.  Resolution Trust Corp. v. Elman, 949 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.1991). The district court ruled that the Hsus would carry their burden as to the first element if the School denied them their First Amendment rights:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41\n",
      "If, as plaintiffs contend, they are being deprived of their First Amendment rights by defendants' nondiscrimination policy, they have and will continue to sustain irreparable harm. As the Supreme Court has stated:  \"The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"  Elrod v. Burns, [427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2690, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976)] . . . .  Accordingly, this Court finds that plaintiffs have demonstrated that they will suffer irreparable harm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42\n",
      "876 F.Supp. at 451. The district court's finding of irreparable harm was thus conditioned on the conclusion (ultimately rejected by the district court) that the Hsus were being deprived of free speech rights. Since the irreparable harm inquiry depends on the merits of the claims, we turn to the merits, asking whether the Hsus are \"likely to succeed,\" and consider irreparable injury at the end of our opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "The Hsus make two statutory and several constitutional claims. Consistent with our practice of avoiding constitutional questions wherever possible, we begin with the Hsus' statutory claims.

Nelson, 472 U.S. 846, 854, 105 S.Ct. 2992, 2996, 86 L.Ed.2d 664 (1985) (it is \"a fundamental rule of judicial restraint\" that \"[p]rior to reaching any constitutional questions, federal courts must consider nonconstitutional grounds for decision\" (internal quotations omitted));  Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162, 168-69 (2d Cir.1991) (same).\n",

      "45\n",
      "It shall be unlawful for any public secondary school which receives Federal financial assistance and which has a limited open forum to deny equal access or a fair opportunity to, or discriminate against, any students who wish to conduct a meeting within that limited open forum on the basis of the religious, political, philosophical, or other content of the speech at such meetings.\n",

      "46\n",
      "There is no doubt that Roslyn High School is a \"public secondary school\" that has a \"limited open forum\"7 and receives federal funds.

      "\n",
      "47\n",
      "There is scant authority to guide us in our effort to interpret these statutory terms. The legislative history of the Act9 indicates that its authors sought to end discrimination against religious extracurricular groups in public schools by mandating a policy of neutrality. See 130 Cong.  Rec. 19,224 (1984) (statement of Sen.  Hatfield).  To the Act's authors, \"equal access\" meant that \"secondary school students engaging in religious speech have the same rights to associate together and to speak as do students who wish to meet to discuss chess, politics, or philosophy.\" Id. at 19,216 (Sen.  Denton) (emphasis added).\n",

      "Supporting and opposing members of Congress worried that this grant of protection for student speech was too broad and the intrusion on school autonomy too great;  specifically, they expressed concern that a law intended to ensure that after-school prayer groups could meet would leave a school powerless to bar the Ku Klux Klan, cults, or intrusive proselytizers.10  Though Senator Hatfield, the Senate's primary sponsor, thought this concern was overstated, arguing that the Act still allowed schools to outlaw groups that \"would be disruptive to the purpose of [the] school ... [, including a group like] the American Nazi Party ... that is dedicated to the purpose of dividing people, on grounds of race or religion,\" id. at 19,224, he admitted that \"we are [not] going to be able to anticipate every possible instance that will arise under this expansion of rights....\"  Id. at 19,225.11  Indeed, the members of Congress do not appear to have anticipated the situation that confronts us:  there is no discussion in the legislative history about whether \"equal access\" allows an after-school religious club to limit its leaders to those of a particular religious faith. Nor did members of Congress discuss whether the term \"speech at [the] meetings\" includes a leadership eligibility requirement that is intended to guarantee that the speech at the club meetings will have a particular content.\n",

In Mergens, students at a Nebraska public high school wanted to form an after-school Christian club, open to students of all religions, for prayer and Bible discussion.  Id. at 232, 110 S.Ct. at 2362-63. The students sought the school's official recognition, which would have given the club \"access to the school newspaper, bulletin boards, the public address system, and the annual Club Fair.\"  Id. at 247, 110 S.Ct. at 2370. The students' proposal contemplated that there would be no faculty adviser.  Id. at 232, 110 S.Ct. at 2362-63. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 4071(c)(2) & 4072(2). The school denied recognition on the grounds that every recognized club needed a faculty sponsor, and that recognition of a religious club would violate the Establishment Clause.

(We address the Establishment Clause aspect of the Court's decision in section IV, infra.) In discussing whether the school's refusal to recognize the Bible club fell within the terms of the statute, the Court concerned itself almost exclusively with the meaning of the term \"noncurriculum related student groups,\" a concept not at issue in our case.12  The final paragraph of the Court's statutory interpretation section briefly discussed the term \"equal access,\" holding simply that to deny the Bible Club \"official recognition\" (including denial of access to the school newspaper, bulletin boards, and public address system) was to deny it \"equal access.\"  Id. at 247, 110 S.Ct. at 2370.\n",

In interpreting the Act, we therefore rely on the common meanings of the words themselves, the logic and architecture of the Act, the congressional purpose of providing religious clubs with the \"same rights\" as other clubs, the Supreme Court's direction in Mergens that the Act is to be \"interpreted broadly,\" 496 U.S. at 239, 110 S.Ct. at 2366, and Supreme Court cases from analogous areas of the law.\n",

      "Did the School refuse to recognize the Hsus' club \"on the basis of the religious ... content of the speech at [the Club's] meetings\"? One might argue that there is no \"speech\" at issue here. After all, the School did not base its qualified recognition of the Club on what would be said at the Club meetings, but on what could be characterized as the Club's \"act\" of excluding non-Christians from leadership. The School has demonstrated that it would recognize the Walking on Water Club (or any other religious club) without regard to the content of the club's prayers or discussions, so long as no religious exclusions were made.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "54\n",
      "We are therefore confronted with difficult issues about the meaning of the statutory term \"speech.\" We conclude that, in light of the Supreme Court's command that we construe the Act broadly, the term \"speech\" includes the Walking on Water's Club leadership policy provision, to the extent that it is reasonably designed to assure that a certain type of religious speech will take place at the Club's meetings.13  We take guidance from the Supreme Court's recent decision in Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2338, 132 L.Ed.2d 487 (1995). In that case, the Court recognized that the message a group imparts sometimes depends upon its ability to exclude certain people, and that this exclusion may be protected by the First Amendment. The veterans group that organized the annual St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston refused to let an Irish gay pride group march with a gay pride banner. The Massachusetts courts held that this exclusion ran afoul of the state's public accommodations law, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of, inter alia, sexual orientation.  Id. at ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2341-43. The Supreme Court reversed, holding that this application of the state law violated the parade organizers' First Amendment free speech rights.  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2343. The Court noted that the parade did not exclude gay people in general, but rather excluded a group of gay people that wanted to communicate a particular message during the parade. By excluding that group, the parade organizers sought to \"tailor\" their own message by omitting a particular communication from the banners that constituted their speech, id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2347, and by \"select[ing] the expressive units of the parade from potential participants.\"14  Id. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2348. The lesson we draw from Hurley is that the principle of \"speaker's autonomy\" gives a speaker the right, in some circumstances, to prevent certain groups from contributing to the speaker's speech, if the groups' contribution would alter the speaker's message.\n",

      "Hurley does not control this case, because (first) it concerns speech rights under the Constitution, not a federal statute, and (second) the Club's proposed exclusion differs somewhat from the exclusion at issue in Hurley. Here, we are not faced with the exclusion of a discrete group that will definitely communicate a specific message if included. Rather, a broad cross-section of people is excluded from leadership in the Club because they lack a personal characteristic or belief, without any showing that they would desire to communicate any particular message.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "56\n",
      "Despite these two differences, Hurley remains instructive. First, since the Act creates an analog15 to the First Amendment's default rule banning content-based speech discrimination, cases discussing the meaning of \"speech\" in First Amendment jurisprudence are also interpretive tools for understanding the Act.  Second, the exclusions here and in Hurley are too similar to be meaningfully distinguished. As in Hurley, the Club's decision to exclude is based on its desire to preserve the content of its message. The Hsus claim that having Christian leaders necessarily shapes the content of the religious speech at their meetings, because the nature and quality of the speech at the meetings is dependent upon the religious commitment of the officers. We can accept this claim to the extent that there is an integral connection between the exclusionary leadership policy and the \"religious speech\" at their meetings. No party or amicus is challenging the idea that the activities of this Club will consist of \"religious speech.\" We accept--as the parties and the district court have apparently accepted--that the purpose of the Club is to organize participation in activities that will be in the nature of religious devotions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "57\n",
      "However, as we review the Club's constitution, we see that some of the activities are not unambiguously \"religious.\" Although meetings will consist mostly of prayers, \"singspiration\" (a form of musical prayer), Bible readings, and testimonies about the impact of Jesus Christ in the students' lives, the Club's constitution also lists guest speakers, skits, and games as possible activities at the meetings.16  There is no reason to limit the range of activities that may be undertaken by an after-school religious club that discriminates, so long as the activities are integral to a sectarian religious experience. But to the extent that such a group engages in social and community activities that are not integral to a sectarian religious experience, it is in danger of becoming merely a religious affinity group practicing social exclusion. The entire thrust of the Hsus' case, the School's resistance, and the amici's arguments assumes that the activities at the Club's meetings promote and express the Christian religious experience in an integral way, and we proceed on this assumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "58\n",
      "On the other hand, the constitution also lists picnics and volunteer community service as Club activities, events which would obviously take place outside of the Club's meetings at the schoolhouse. Taking an expansive view, one can say that religion suffuses all the conduct of a pious person, so that the worshipful contemplation of nature on a picnic, as well as acts of charity and service, may all be deemed to have a religious dimension. However, this is not \"religious speech\" within the meaning of the Equal Access Act, if only because it will not occur at a \"meeting.\" In addition, there is no reason to believe, based on the present record, that the planning of a picnic or a service project must be done by a Christian in order to make it meaningful for Christian students. In the Walking on Water Club, the planning of these non-school activities is the only responsibility of the Activities Coordinator, who, according to the Hsus, must ensure that the activities do not \"offend Christian sensibilities.\" But an agnostic with an understanding of \"Christian sensibilities\" might plan these activities as well as any other student. Similarly, it is very difficult to understand why the \"religious speech\" at the Walking on Water Club meetings would be affected by having a non-Christian \"Secretary,\" whose principal duties are \"to accurately record the minutes of meetings and be involved in the Club's financial accounting and reporting.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "59\n",
      "The Hsus claim that all officers, including the Secretary and Activities Coordinator, must be prepared to \"open or close a meeting with prayer ... or to lead a Bible study\" and that this duty justifies the exclusion of non-Christians from those posts. But this assertion has no limiting principle. Anyone in attendance at a religious meeting may be called upon for a benediction or to \"lead a Bible study.\" There is thus no difference between (a) the Hsus' desire to discriminate in the selection of numerous officers of a small club, each of whom may be called upon to officiate briefly, and (b) a religious test for membership or attendance, which is plainly insupportable.17\n",

      "60\n",
      "The leadership provision is defensible, however, as to the President, Vice-President, and Music Coordinator of the Club, because their duties consist of leading Christian prayers and devotions and safeguarding the \"spiritual content\" of the meetings. Guaranteeing that these officers will be dedicated Christians assures that the Club's programs, in which any student is of course free to participate, will be imbued with certain qualities of commitment and spirituality. Thus, we conclude that the decision to allow only Christians to be President, Vice-President, or Music Coordinator is calculated to make a certain type of speech possible, and will affect the \"religious ... content of the speech at [the] meetings,\" within the meaning of the Equal Access Act.18  From this point on, our reference to the Club's exclusionary leadership policy refers only to the exclusion of non-Christians from these three leadership positions.\n",

      "In interpreting the term \"speech,\" we are also guided by a set of Supreme Court cases similar to Hurley, although analyzed under the Court's freedom of association jurisprudence. The right to free association for expressive purposes is implicit in the First Amendment free speech guarantee. See NAACP v. Alabama ex. rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460-61, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 1170-71, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488 (1958);  Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., 431 U.S. 209, 233, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1798, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977). That right is an instrumental one:  expressive association is protected \"as an indispensable means of preserving other individual liberties.\"  Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3249, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). The right to associate also includes the right not to associate.  Id. at 623, 104 S.Ct. at 3252-53.\n",

In both cases, the Court upheld the application of state antidiscrimination laws to private civic clubs that wished to continue their exclusion of women as members. Although the Court determined that the statutes infringed on the expressive association rights of the private clubs, \"that infringement [was] justified because it serves the State's compelling interest in eliminating discrimination against women.\"  Rotary, 481 U.S. at 549, 107 S.Ct. at 1948. See also Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623, 104 S.Ct. at 3252-53;  New York State Club Ass'n, Inc. v.

      "Roberts and Rotary (like Hurley ) are analytically distinct from this case, because they involve constitutional rights, not statutory ones. Nevertheless (like Hurley ) they assist our interpretation of the term \"speech\" in the Equal Access Act. The Act, which protects students only against the denial of equal access on the basis of their \"speech,\" does not expressly protect their right to \"associate.\" But since the grant of speech protection is to \"students who wish to conduct a meeting,\" the right to associate for the purpose of holding such a meeting is a necessary corollary. The Act's authors made it clear that the language of § 4071(a) was intended to protect both free speech and free association rights of certain student clubs. 130 Cong.  Rec. 19,216 (1984) (statement of Sen.  Denton);  id. at 19,217 (Sen.  Hatfield).  Thus, the Act contains an implicit right of expressive association when the goal of that association is to meet for a purpose protected by the Act.\n",

      "As in Roberts and Rotary, when the students' desire to hold a meeting covered by the Act involves a decision not to associate with other students, that decision, depending on its purpose, may constitute an exercise of the students' right of expressive association. On the one hand, an exclusion solely for reasons of hostility or cliquishness, with no direct bearing or effect on the group's speech, does not implicate the right to expressive association. But expressive association is implicated when the decision to exclude is made in order to foster the group's shared interest in particular speech. See William P. Marshall, Discrimination and the Right of Association, 81 Nw. U.L.Rev. 68, 78-80, 90-91 (1986). As the Court said in Roberts, a regulation that prevents a group from excluding certain people \"may impair the ability of the original members to express only those views that brought them together.\"  468 U.S. at 623, 104 S.Ct. at 3252 (emphasis added).

      "It is undisputed that the decision by the Walking on Water Club to impose a religious test for leadership positions has been made purely for expressive purposes--to guarantee that meetings include the desired worship and observance--rather than for the sake of exclusion itself. As we have explained, supra, this test serves this expressive purpose for three of the leadership positions. As in other instances in which a limitation on the right to associate for expressive purposes has been held to infringe on the right to free speech, the School's refusal to allow the Walking on Water Club to guarantee that Christians will lead its Christian prayers implicates free speech rights under the Act. This does not mean, however, that the students' Equal Access Act claim automatically prevails. On the constitutional level, the right to free association is not absolute.  Roberts and Rotary make clear that a \"compelling\" governmental interest (such as eliminating discrimination against women) will override the right to expressive association.  Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623, 104 S.Ct. at 3252-53;  Rotary, 481 U.S. at 549, 107 S.Ct. at 1947-48. And, since the students' right to expressive association here is based on a statute applicable to public schools--where free speech rights receive somewhat less protection generally--it is not at all apparent that a governmental interest need be \"compelling\" to override the expressive association rights at issue here. We ask in sections IV and V, infra, whether the School has a valid reason (under the Constitution or otherwise) for denying the Club the recognition it seeks. We can conclude at this point, however, that when an after-school religious club excludes people of other religions from conducting its meetings, and when that choice is made to protect the expressive content of the meetings, a school's decision to deny recognition to the club because of the exclusion is a decision based on \"the content of the speech at [the] meetings,\" within the meaning of the Equal Access Act.\n",

      "The District argues that \"equal access\" has not been denied. It claims that it is applying its nondiscrimination policy neutrally to all after-school clubs, that this equal treatment amounts to \"equal access,\" and that recognition of the Walking on Water Club, with its discriminatory constitution, would afford the Club special treatment, a level of accommodation that the Act does not demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "70\n",
      "The District's focus on the even application of its nondiscrimination rule misses the point. The Act mandates that students be given \"equal access,\" not that the School's internal rules be administered uniformly. A rule against wearing hats in the school building, perfectly and consistently enforced, might deprive Jewish students of equal access to after-school facilities for shared religious observance. Similarly, a rule requiring students to wear appropriate footwear at all times, perfectly and consistently enforced, might effectively ban after-school meetings of the Yoga Club. The neutral application of the School's rules allows the School to say that it is treating all clubs equally. But exemptions from neutrally applicable rules that impede one or another club from expressing the beliefs that it was formed to express, may be required if a school is to provide \"equal access.\"\n",

      "The District argues that allowing the Hsus to discriminate on the basis of religion would grant them special rights:  since the Chess Club may not limit its officers to Muslims, even if its founding members trust only Muslims to lead them, then the Walking on Water Club may not limit its officers to Christians. We agree that the Hsus are only entitled to the same rights that other student clubs have. But the District's argument ignores the fact that the Walking on Water Club is a religious club and the Chess Club is not. Walking on Water Club meetings will include certain types of religious prayers and songs. The Club's leadership eligibility requirement on the basis of religion is therefore similar to a chess club's eligibility requirement based on chess. Though the District argues that only those exclusions based on \"ability and performance\" are appropriate, this ignores one of the principal ways in which many extracurricular clubs typically define themselves:  by requiring that their leaders show a firm commitment to the club's cause. The record does not include the constitutions of other extracurricular clubs at Roslyn High School,19 but it would be sensible--and unremarkable in light of the clubs' particular purposes--for the Students Protecting the Environment Against Contamination Club to require that officers have a demonstrated commitment to conservation or recycling;  for Students Against Drunk Driving to require that officers have taken the pledge;  or for Students for Social Responsibility to require that officers have a social conscience. Similarly, a hypothetical school scouting club could preserve its character and values by requiring that officers be exemplars of the scouting movement, just as a hypothetical Marxist discussion group could require that officers be dedicated to socialist values or be card-carriers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "72\n",
      "All of these \"tests\" of an officer's commitment to the group's cause allow the group to ensure that its agenda will be advanced at its meetings. One can expect that students in favor of contaminating the environment will lead different meetings than those against contamination, for instance. Similarly, the Hsus may reasonably expect that the prayers at a Club meeting led by non-Christians would be different than the prayers led by Christians. Seen in this light, the discrimination practiced by the Walking on Water Club merely requires that its officers have a certain level of commitment to the program and purpose of the Club. Because that program and purpose are religious and sectarian, the requisite level of commitment and belief is quite naturally expressed in terms of religious belief.20  Equal treatment should mean that the Walking on Water Club enjoys the same latitude that other clubs may have in determining who is qualified to lead the Club. Thus, just as a secular club may protect its character by restricting eligibility for leadership to those who show themselves committed to the cause, the Hsus may protect their ability to hold Christian Bible meetings by including the leadership provision in the club's constitution.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "73\n",
      "This type of commitment requirement may be especially important to religious clubs. The Equal Access Act provides that \"employees or agents of the school ... [may be] present at religious meetings only in a nonparticipatory capacity.\"  20 U.S.C. § 4071(c)(3). Though the Act provides protection for political and philosophical clubs as well as religious clubs, this provision of the Act singles out religious clubs, denying only to them the opportunity to have faculty sponsors (presumably because of Establishment Clause concerns). Thus, while political clubs and chess clubs may have faculty sponsors to promote institutional stability, help guarantee that new leaders are committed to the club's cause, and ensure that the club remains true to its purpose, religious clubs do not have that protection. It is therefore particularly understandable that a religious group would seek to assure in other ways that its leadership is genuinely committed to its cause.\n",

      "\n",
      "74\n",
      "The District argues that its nondiscrimination policy does not in any way hamper the ability of Club members to express their religious beliefs. After all, says the District, the nondiscrimination policy \"does not require that a 'non-Christian' lead the club.  [Club] members are free to elect whomever they believe will be the best leader and may cast their vote according to their conscience.\" The district court took a similar view, suggesting that the School's nondiscrimination policy did not actually prevent the Hsus from forming a club with Christian leaders, because the Club could rely on \"[e]lective forces\" to make sure that its desired leaders were chosen.21  876 F.Supp. at 455. The Hsus' concern that the Club \"risk[ed] facing 'non-Christian leadership' \" and might be \"taken over\" by students inimical to the Club's purpose was dismissed by the court as \"speculation.\"  Id. at 456. But of course, it is also speculation at this point to conclude that there would be no hostility toward a Christian Bible Club at Roslyn High.  We simply do not know. And considering that (i) the Club may not have a faculty sponsor and (ii) religious groups have historically been the object of hostility and persecution more often than, say, chess players or glee clubs, the Hsus' concern that their effort to pray and discuss the Bible after school might be disrupted, though speculative, is by no means unreasonable. In any event, it is not disputed that this concern has been enough to chill their speech.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "75\n",
      "More importantly, telling the Club to rely on elections to assure that its leaders are Christians contemplates that the Club will engage in the same type of religious discrimination embodied in the Club's constitution. The School cannot have it both ways. If it insists on outlawing all religious discrimination, including clubs with discriminatory constitutions, it can scarcely recognize clubs that elect officers on the basis of their religion. But since the whole purpose of the Club is to gather for sectarian praise and worship (as the School and district court have recognized), the need for the Hsus to realize that purpose justifies the imposition of a religious test for the leaders of the after-school meetings. Thus, the School's complete ban on \"religious discrimination,\" however it is enforced, also bans the Bible club envisioned by the Hsus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "76\n",
      "We therefore reject the District's argument that the Hsus could abandon the leadership provision of the Club's constitution without suffering any tangible harm. Under the Equal Access Act, the Hsus may try to preserve the content of the religious speech at their meetings by discriminating in a way that ensures that the Club's leaders will be committed to both its cause and a particular type of expression. The School's recognition of the Club only on the condition that it abandon this effort therefore constitutes a failure to provide equal treatment, and denies the Walking on Water Club \"equal access.\" In short, the Hsus are likely to succeed on their claim that Roslyn High violated § 4071(a) of the Equal Access Act, to the extent that the Club's leadership provision applies to the President, Vice-President, and Music Coordinator of the Club.22\n",

      "By concluding that the School's non-recognition denies the Hsus \"equal access,\" we are giving the term \"equal access\" the broad construction that the Supreme Court requires. See Mergens, 496 U.S. at 239, 110 S.Ct. at 2366. This does not mean, however, that all efforts by a student club to exclude other students are protected by the statute, even if the exclusion is based on a club's desire to realize its expressive purpose. The Equal Access Act is not a set of federal handcuffs fitted to school principals. Schools must have rules to control their students, and rules will always have the effect of suppressing someone's idea for a club. Though the School's effort to apply its nondiscrimination rule is trumped by the Equal Access Act, the Act's mandate of equal access can be trumped by the School's responsibility for upholding the Constitution, for protecting the rights of other students, and for maintaining \"appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\" See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep.  Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 509, 89 S.Ct. 733, 738, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969) (internal quotations omitted).

      "The School, with support from the Anti-Defamation League as amicus curiae, claims that exempting the Walking on Water Club from its nondiscrimination policy would violate the Establishment Clause by conferring upon a Christian club a benefit that other clubs do not enjoy. This exemption would violate all three prongs of the so-called \"Lemon test,\" runs the argument, because the exemption would have no secular purpose, would have the primary effect of advancing religion, and would excessively entangle the School in religious matters. See Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2111-12, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971). The School also claims that providing the Club with an exemption would \"encourage and pressure\" students to join the Club and become practicing Christians.

      "As the Court has pointed out, the government may not act with the purpose of \"endors[ing]\" religion, Mergens, 496 U.S. at 249, 110 S.Ct. at 2371, or \"promoting a particular point of view in religious matters.\"  Amos, 483 U.S. at 335, 107 S.Ct. at 2868. There is no promotion or endorsement of religion here, as the defendants themselves have made clear.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "95\n",
      "These terms meet the requirement of Justice Marshall's concurrence in Mergens (which, of the three opinions finding no Establishment Clause violation, was the one most worried about the tension between the Clause and the Equal Access Act, see supra note 23), that the School must \"disassociate itself from the Club's religious speech\" by, for example, \"affirmatively disclaim[ing] any endorsement of the Christian club.\"  496 U.S. at 270, 110 S.Ct. at 2382 (Marshall, J., concurring). Assuming that the School were to retain a similar disclaimer in recognizing the Walking on Water Club with its exclusionary policy, the School's stated purpose could not be mistaken for an endorsement. In any event, recognition of the Club in compliance with the Equal Access Act will serve the same purpose as Congress's purpose in passing the statute:  \"to prevent discrimination against religious and other types of speech.\"  Id. at 249, 110 S.Ct. at 2371;  see supra section III.C.\n",

Section 702 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 gives religious groups an exemption from a generally applicable nondiscrimination law. In finding a secular purpose for that provision, the Amos Court stressed that a law's purpose need not be \"unrelated to religion.\"  483 U.S. at 335, 107 S.Ct. at 2868. Here, the purpose for exempting the Club would be similar to the purpose underlying § 702:  to \"alleviate significant governmental interference with the ability\" of the Club to engage in after-school prayers. See id. As discussed above, the Club reasonably insists that the actual leaders of its Christian prayers be Christians, on the assumption that only they have the necessary commitment and faith to do the job. The nondiscrimination policy interferes with the realization of the Club as a religious group. Under Amos, the removal of that impediment serves a secular function.\n",

      "98\n",
      "In ascertaining whether the primary effect of the School's recognition would be to advance religion, the Court's analysis in Mergens and Amos is once again dispositive. In Mergens, the critical inquiry was whether the school \"endorsed\" the religious speech.  496 U.S. at 250, 110 S.Ct. at 2371. The Court specified that disclaimers of the type already devised by Roslyn High would guarantee that no reasonable student could conclude that the school was using its activities and influence to advance religion.  Id. at 251, 110 S.Ct. at 2372. And as the Mergens Court made clear, the conduct of religious exercises in a school, with the school's sanction and under its \"aegis,\" does not have the primary effect of advancing religion.  Id. at 250-52, 110 S.Ct. at 2371-73. Nor is it impermissible, according to Mergens, for a club engaging in after-school prayers to have access to the school's bulletin boards, public address system, and newspaper.  Id. at 247, 252, 110 S.Ct. at 2370, 2373. Finally, the Mergens Court has already found it immaterial that the religious club's announcements would have a captive audience composed of students who are required to attend school under compulsory attendance laws.  Id. at 249-52, 110 S.Ct. at 2371-73;  cf. Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 597-99, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2661, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (impermissible for public high school to have rabbi give opening prayer at graduation ceremony, \"because the State has in every practical sense compelled attendance and participation in an explicit religious exercise at an event of singular importance to every student, one the objecting student had no real alternative to avoid\").\n",

      "The School and the Anti-Defamation League raise all of these arguments anew. There is no indication, however, that the religious activities of the Walking on Water Club will be any different from the religious activities of the Bible club at issue in Mergens. The Walking on Water Club may fill an after-school classroom with musical prayers, solicit new members with posters, or announce its meetings over the public address system. But these activities do not distinguish the Club in any meaningful way from the club in Mergens;  nor do they suggest that recognition of the Walking on Water Club would have the primary effect of advancing religion.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "100\n",
      "The salient difference between this case and Mergens, of course, is the dispensation that the Club needs with respect to the School's nondiscrimination policy. But exempting the Club from the nondiscrimination policy simply puts the Club on the same footing as non-religious clubs who make distinctions among their members on the basis of commitment. In this situation, an exemption is a policy of neutrality. See supra section III.C.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "101\n",
      "Even if the exemption from the nondiscrimination policy is viewed as a \"benefit,\" enjoyed only by the Walking on Water Club (and other sectarian religious clubs), there still is no Establishment Clause violation. As the Court explained in Amos, the flow of a \"benefit\" only to a religious group does not mean that the government's actions are advancing religion. The School--like Congress in enacting § 702 of the Civil Rights Act--would simply be \"allow[ing the Club] to advance religion.\"  483 U.S. at 337, 107 S.Ct. at 2869. The exemption here provides a \"benefit\" to a religious group, as did the property tax exemption upheld by the Court in Walz v. Tax Comm'n, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970). As in Walz, the benefit means that the religious group can do something it could not do before, and as a result may be able to better advance its religion. But allowing people with religious faith to advance their religions is not what is meant by \"the establishment of religion,\" as the Court made clear in Walz:  for the authors of the Religion Clauses, \"the 'establishment' of religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\"  397 U.S. at 668, 90 S.Ct. at 1411;  see also Amos, 483 U.S. at 337, 107 S.Ct. at 2869. In other words, the state action itself must constitute an endorsement of religion. Cf. Mergens, 496 U.S. at 250, 110 S.Ct. at 2371 (\"[T]here is a crucial difference between government speech endorsing religion, which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.\"). Since the exemption from the School's policy simply allows the Club to pursue a leadership policy that it reasonably considers critical to its ability to hold religious meetings at the school, and since Mergens decided that allowing such meetings does not constitute a state endorsement or advancement of religion, the exemption cannot be considered an endorsement by the School of the Hsus' religion or the Club's leadership policy. There is no showing that the exemption of the Walking on Water Club would constitute an endorsement of its activities. Absent such a showing, we can only conclude that the exemption would not have the primary effect of advancing religion.27\n",

      "The potential source of entanglement in our case that was not present in Mergens is the Club's policy limiting its leaders to those who \"accept Jesus Christ as savior\"--which, according to the Hsus' counsel, means all Christians. The School worries that, if there is an argument within the Club about whether a particular student has or has not in fact \"accepted Jesus Christ as savior,\" the School would be forced to mediate the dispute and to adjudicate the student's standing as a Christian. We agree that certification of religious qualifications would constitute excessive entanglement in a religious group's internal affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "107\n",
      "But the School's anxiety is unwarranted. Leadership disputes that hinge on a student's supposed religious qualifications can be resolved internally by the members of the Club, who have the option, if there is a schism, of splitting the group into two different clubs. Alternatively, if the School is faced with rival claimants to leadership, it may treat each faction as a separate club. If the squabbling gets out of hand, then (as counsel for the Hsus suggested at oral argument) the School would be justified in withdrawing recognition of the Club for \"materially and substantially interfer[ing] with the orderly conduct\" of the School. See 20 U.S.C. § 4071(c)(4). And of course, under Tinker and the line of cases discussed infra in section V.B., the accommodation of student expression does not require the School to lay down any instrument it needs to maintain discipline. Since we do not see how the School would necessarily become embroiled in the internal workings of the Club, we conclude that recognition will not entangle the School in the Club's religious activities.\n",

Congressional supporters of the Equal Access Act made it clear during the floor debates that the Act adopted these limitations,28 and that they did not intend the Act to open the school doors to hate groups, cults, and proselytizers. See 130 Cong.  Rec. 19,232 (statement of Sen.  Hatfield) (Equal Protection Clause will protect against discriminatory student groups);  id. at 19,244 (Sen.

      "The Hsus argue that discrimination by an after-school student group that is suitably distanced from the school is a purely private action and that the Equal Protection Clause therefore does not come into play. The Hsus admit, however, that their club cannot exist without authorization from the School;  indeed, the School's recognition is what the Hsus are seeking here. Thus, even though the Equal Access Act states that a school may not \"sponsor[ ]\" a club like the Hsus', 20 U.S.C. § 4071(c)(2), the School's grant of recognition, which the club needs in order to gain access to school facilities, authorizes and enables the club to pursue its exclusionary policy. In Amos, the state action was evident:  Congress had enacted an exemption of religious groups from a generally applicable ban on religious discrimination in employment decisions.  483 U.S. at 329, 107 S.Ct. at 2865. The state action here is similar:  recognition of the Club would mean an exemption for religious after-school clubs from one part of the School's nondiscrimination policy. This exemption would allow religious clubs to discriminate in a way that other clubs may not. Thus, a school's recognition of a club that discriminates does constitute state action and does implicate the Equal Protection Clause.\n",

What the Equal Protection Clause forbids is state action that implements or sanctions invidious discrimination. The use of heightened scrutiny for all cases of racial and sex discrimination implements both the suspicion that such discrimination is almost always invidious, and the policy that only the strongest reasons justify advantages based on race or sex. See Loving v. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 10-11, 87 S.Ct. 1817, 1822-23, 18 L.Ed.2d 1010 (1967);  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197-98, 97 S.Ct. 451, 456-57, 50 L.Ed.2d 397 (1976). Similar suspicion accompanies the granting of benefits by the state to one religious group but not others. See Amos, 483 U.S. at 339, 107 S.Ct. at 2870. If any of these types of discrimination were present here, we would have a different case. But because religious discrimination by a religious group is \"vital\" to the group's religious mission and the ability of the group to define itself on the basis of shared faith, no great suspicion attaches to a government decision to allow it.\n",

      "The Court in Amos was considering allowances made for a church, which of course the Walking on Water Club is not. But this Club is still a religious community that has the same need to define itself as other religious communities, notwithstanding its reliance on a public school to sanction its existence and to give it a roof. As in Amos, the state's accommodation of religious discrimination by a religious group allows the group to define and express itself in religious terms--a state motivation that is benign and a state purpose that is legitimate. In addition, state actions that allow religious discrimination only by religious groups impose no burdens on non-religious groups. Nor do such actions in any way subordinate or stigmatize non-religious groups by suggesting that they are inferior, since they have their own ways of pursuing legitimate exclusions that help them define their groups and promote their agendas. Having considered the purpose for the exemption that the Club needs from the School, and the effect of exempting the Club from the School's nondiscrimination policy, we conclude that there is nothing invidious about it. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216-17 & n. 14, 102 S.Ct. 2382, 2394-95 & n. 14, 72 L.Ed.2d 786 (1982) (classifications based on prejudice are generally invidious);  Brown v.

      "Even if a school's accommodation of a religious group is motivated by the legitimate desire to facilitate the group's self-expression, and even if that accommodation does no harm to non-religious groups, the particular type of discrimination practiced by the group may lead to a finding of invidiousness. If authorized by the School, private act of invidious discrimination by a student club also constitutes a state act of invidious discrimination. Treating one religion differently than another will almost always be invidious. But determining whether discrimination is invidious in a particular case depends on an understanding of the context that informs and characterizes that discrimination. Understanding this context requires consideration of who is discriminating. The Walking on Water Club wishes to discriminate in one respect on the basis of faith. As the district court said, this is a type of discrimination that would be unlawful for the School \"to engage in directly.\"  876 F.Supp. at 455. But the critical distinction here is that by granting the Walking on Water Club recognition on the Club's terms, the School would not be engaging in this type of discrimination directly. It would simply be letting the Walking on Water Club do it.\n",

      "Nothing in the record or the School's arguments suggests that the Walking on Water Club insists on Christian leaders because of animus against people of other religions. Since the Club exists solely to engage in Christian \"praise of God,\" non-Christians suffer no articulable disadvantage by being unable to lead the Club's prayers and devotions. Nor is there any indication that the exclusion of non-Christians from Club leadership will subordinate or stigmatize them. Were any of these facts otherwise, the School might be justified in refusing an exemption from its nondiscrimination policy. See Bob Jones Univ. v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 604, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 2035, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983) (IRS's refusal to grant tax-exempt status to a university with racially discriminatory admissions policies upheld using strict scrutiny analysis under the Free Exercise Clause, because of the government's \"fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education\").29\n",

We reject the first argument for the reasons stated above, since the invidiousness of religious discrimination will vary depending on the surrounding context. The concern expressed in the School's second argument is unwarranted. The Equal Protection Clause and the School's nondiscrimination policy still allow the School to resist these destructive forms of discrimination, precisely because they are invidious. But since there is no invidious discrimination here, we conclude that an exemption for the Walking on Water Club is consistent with the Equal Protection Clause.\n",

East Brunswick Bd. of Ed., 12 F.3d 1244, 1255-56 (3d Cir.1993), and leadership positions in a club like Students Against Drugs may be inaccessible to students who advocate the legalization of drugs. Clearly, some types of discrimination are permissible in a high school setting, and some are not. The district court concluded that \"a school-recognized club that is permitted to discriminate on the basis of religion likely would be disruptive to the educational mission of the school,\" because it would be \"invidious\" and would impinge on the \"rights of other Roslyn students to be free from discrimination in school.\"  876 F.Supp. at 462. But as we explained in section V.A., supra, religious discrimination is not automatically invidious in a religious club;  and the right of other students to be free from invidious discrimination is not infringed here. As the Court said in Fraser, a school may encourage \"tolerance of divergent political and religious views\" as part of its mission to inculcate \"fundamental values,\" 478 U.S. at 681, 106 S.Ct. at 3163, although this type of tolerance need not extend to \"highly offensive or highly threatening\" speech.  Id. at 683, 106 S.Ct. at 3163. The School does not (and we think cannot) argue that the discriminatory leadership policy of the Walking on Water Club is highly offensive or threatening.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "130\n",
      "It is a delicate task to supervise student discrimination and exclusion to ensure that it is consistent with \"fundamental values\" and is not \"invidious.\" Schools may encounter student religious groups that want to discriminate invidiously on the basis of religion, by excluding others out of bias or by stigmatizing those excluded. We admit that the line between invidious and non-invidious discrimination does not glow in the dark. But for better or worse, schools have had to draw that line ever since the Tinker case in 1969.\n",

      "In doing so, public school administrators must be given a great deal of autonomy in deciding how best to run their schools:  \"[T]he education of the Nation's youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state and local school officials, and not of federal judges.\"  Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. at 273, 108 S.Ct. at 571. We must recognize, however, that the Equal Access Act is a definite, though measured, interference in these purely local decisions. A school's conclusory statement that prayer meetings will substantially and materially impede the orderly conduct of the school is an insufficient weight in the balance struck by the Act.32  See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 508, 89 S.Ct. at 737 (\"[I]n our system, undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression.\"). And here, the School offers nothing beyond these conclusory assertions. Based on this record, we conclude that allowing the Walking on Water Club to guarantee that three of its prayer leaders will be Christians does not constitute \"substantial and material interference\" with the School's mission of educating and disciplining.\n",

      "VI. Preliminary Injunction\n",
      "\n",
      "132\n",
      "Having determined that the Hsus are likely to succeed on their claim that the Equal Access Act requires Roslyn High School to recognize the Walking on Water Club with its leadership provision (as applied to three of its leaders), and that this recognition is constitutional, we conclude that the second prong of the preliminary injunction standard (likelihood of success on the merits) is satisfied. The first prong is satisfied as well, since Timothy Hsu has been suffering and continues to suffer irreparable harm. The Equal Access Act protects free speech rights. As mentioned above, we follow the Supreme Court and take no position on whether the Equal Access Act is required by the First Amendment or whether it extends free speech rights beyond the scope of the First Amendment. See supra note 6. Either way, the Act protects \"expressive liberties,\" and we therefore take guidance from the Supreme Court's oft-quoted statement that \"[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\"  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2689, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976);  see Paulsen v. County of Nassau, 925 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir.1991) (statement in Elrod is justified by \"our historical commitment to expressive liberties\"). In past cases, we have extended that principle to conclude that prisoners are irreparably injured when they are denied access to published reports containing criticisms of prison conditions, Abdul Wali v. Coughlin, 754 F.2d 1015, 1026 (2d Cir.1985) (quoting Elrod ), and that parents of public school students are irreparably injured when the school provides separate remedial education classes to a discrete religious group (even though the parents' \"expressive liberties\" were not infringed).  Parents' Ass'n v. Quinones, 803 F.2d 1235, 1242 (2d Cir.1986) (quoting Elrod ). We believe that the denial for one year (now two years) of the right to pray in an after-school Bible group as envisioned by the Hsus also constitutes \"irreparable injury,\" and that the Hsus are entitled to the issuance of a preliminary injunction so that the injury will cease.\n",
      "\n",
      "VII. Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "133\n",
      "Our holding is narrow. We do not hold that administrators must allow religious discrimination in the schools. Religious discrimination by student clubs will often be invidious and will rarely fall within our holding. However, when a sectarian religious club discriminates on the basis of religion for the purpose of assuring the sectarian religious character of its meetings, a school must allow it to do so unless that club's specific form of discrimination would be invidious (and would thereby violate the equal protection rights of other students), or would otherwise disrupt or impair the school's educational mission. Courts must be extremely reluctant to overrule the judgment of local school administrators who are responsible for making these sensitive decisions. But in this case, the only judgment Roslyn High School has made is that every instance of religious discrimination by a student group is invidious and disrupts the school's mission. Invidious discrimination entails more context-specific judgments. We hold only that, on this record, the Hsus are likely to succeed on that part of their Equal Access Act claim that relates to the Club's President, Vice-President, and Music Coordinator. We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for the issuance of an injunction and additional proceedings (if necessary) that are consistent with this opinion. See Patton v. Dole, 806 F.2d 24, 31 (2d Cir.1986) (\"Although reversal of an order denying an application for a preliminary injunction is customarily accompanied by a directive that the district court conduct a new hearing on remand, an appellate court, on a finding of merit in plaintiff's case, can in the alternative direct the district court to issue the injunction.\"); 11A Charles A.

For many individuals, religious activity derives meaning in large measure from participation in a larger religious community. Such a community represents an ongoing tradition of shared beliefs, an organic entity not reducible to a mere aggregation of individuals. Determining that certain activities are in furtherance of an organization's religious mission, and that only those committed to that mission should conduct them, is thus a means by which a religious community defines itself. Solicitude for a church's ability to do so reflects the idea that furtherance of the autonomy of religious organizations often furthers individual religious freedom as well.\n",

See Rosenberger, --- U.S. at ----, 115 S.Ct. at 2525 (O'Connor, J., concurring) (\" 'the message [must be] one of neutrality rather than endorsement' \") (quoting Mergens, 496 U.S. at 248, 110 S.Ct. at 2370-71)\n",

      " The Anti-Defamation League points for support to Parents' Ass'n v. Quinones, 803 F.2d 1235 (2d Cir.1986), a case that predates both Mergens and Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993) (no Establishment Clause violation to allow religious community group to show religious-oriented film in school classroom after school). In Quinones, a public school, required by federal law to give remedial education to all \"educationally deprived\" students in the school district, provided remedial classes to 400 girls who attended a private Hasidic elementary school. The public school built new walls closing off a previously open corridor so that the Hasidic students would be insulated from the largely-Hispanic public school population, as the Hasidic leaders and parents insisted. Yiddish-speaking teachers were provided for the classes, and \"English as a Second Language\" courses were taught, even though such courses were not available to the largely Spanish-speaking public school students.  803 F.2d at 1237-38\n",
      "We held that the school violated the Establishment Clause by creating a \"symbolic link\" between the school and the Hasidim \"that is likely to have a magnified negative impact on the minds\" of the students.  Id. at 1241. We explained:\n",
      "The lengths to which the [school] has gone to cater to these religious views, which are inherently divisive, are plainly likely to be perceived, by the Hasidim and others, as governmental support for the separatist tenets of the Hasidic faith. Worse still, to impressionable young minds, the [school's] Plan may appear to endorse not only separatism, but the derogatory rationale for separatism expressed by some of the Hasidim.\n",
      "Id.  Having renovated the school solely to satisfy one religion's demand that there be no contact with public school students, the school in Quinones could not avoid sending a message of endorsement. This case is different. Here, the School is providing ordinary classroom space, as it does to other school groups, and has explicitly disclaimed any endorsement of the Club's activities. In addition, the \"benefit\" given to the Club (an exemption from the ban on religious discrimination) could not be desired by non-religious groups for any non-invidious purpose. The Hasidic girls, on the other hand, were provided with an exclusive benefit (English as a Second Language courses) that the other students legitimately wanted and may have needed. Finally, the school's support for the Hasidim had \"a magnified negative impact on the minds\" of the students because of the sect's \"derogatory rationale [behind its policy of] separatism.\" Here, nothing suggests that the Club's rationale is \"derogatory.\"\n",

(5) to sanction meetings that are otherwise unlawful ... or (7) to abridge the constitutional rights of any person.\" The protection provided by the Tinker line of cases is incorporated in subsections 4071(c)(4) and 4071(f):  subsection 4071(c)(4) provides that a school offers a group \"a fair opportunity\" to meet if it \"uniformly provides,\" inter alia, that \"the meeting does not materially and substantially interfere with the orderly conduct of educational activities within the school\";  subsection 4071(f) provides that, \"Nothing in this [Act] shall be construed to limit the authority of the school ... to maintain order and discipline on school premises [or] to protect the well-being of students and faculty.\"\n",

      "30\n",
      " This phrase differs only immaterially from the standard in Tinker, which allows schools to prohibit expression that interferes with \"appropriate discipline.\" The Act allows the suppression of expression that interferes with \"the orderly conduct of educational activities.\" The phrase \"educational activities\" of course embraces practically everything schools do, including the availability of extracurricular opportunities\n",

Danforth) (under the Act, \"the school administration does have, does continue to have inherent power to prevent the unrestrained, intensive, extreme psychological pressure which could be utilized by some religious groups to attempt to bring other kids within the religious community\"). The Walking on Water Club's constitution states that the Club \"would like to spread the Good News of God and His word.\" There is no indication in the present record that this statement is meant to express anything other than a desire to \"spread\" Christianity to those non-Christians who voluntarily attend the Club's meetings.

But as the Court explained in Tinker, the fact that a school's suppression of student expression is well-intentioned does not make the suppression permissible.

      "Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by student groups called \"Contracted Independent Organizations\" (CIOs).  The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student activities related to the University's educational purpose.  CIOs must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the University and that the University is not responsible for them.  The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely because its student newspaper, Wide Awake:  A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, \"primarily promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,\" as prohibited by the University's SAF Guidelines.  Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.  After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University, the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment Clause.\n",
      "\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech.  Pp. ____.\n",
      "(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794.  In determining whether a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957, this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand, content discrimination—i.e., discrimination against speech because of its subject matter—which may be permissible if it preserves the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint discrimination—i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955.  The most recent and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 124 L.Ed.2d 352, in which the Court held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination.  Here, as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible line-drawing based on content:  By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints.  Pp. ____.\n",
      "(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds rather than access to facilities is unavailing.  Although it may regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233; Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278, 70 L.Ed.2d 440, the University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 76 L.Ed.2d 129.  Its argument that the scarcity of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong.  Pp. ____.\n",
      "(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.  The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach:  The term \"promotes\" as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or ultimate reality, while the term \"manifests\" would bring within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality.  It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. ____.\n",
      "2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying with the Establishment Clause.  Pp. ____.\n",
      "(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.  Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546.  There is no suggestion that the University created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause.  The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.  The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf of, \"religious organizations,\" and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;  it sought funding under the Guidelines as a \"student . . . communications . . . grou[p].\"  Neutrality is also apparent in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate itself from the private speech involved in this case.  The program's neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which would violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp. ____.\n",
      "(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345, 49 L.Ed.2d 179, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue.  A public university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would use the facilities for devotional exercises.  See e.g., Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274.  This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities is paid out of a student activities fund to which students are required to contribute.  Id., at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272.  There is no difference in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved here:  The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers.  Were the contrary view to become law, the University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious message.  Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis.  Pp. ____.\n",

Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him, together with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence and of the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. § 57-1, as one of his proudest achievements, the University is among the Nation's oldest and most respected seats of higher learning.

CIO status is available to any group the majority of whose members are students, whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that complies with certain procedural requirements.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.  A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must pledge not to discriminate in its membership;  and must include in dealings with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer, stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that the University is not responsible for the CIO. App. 27-28.  CIOs enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms and computer terminals.  Id., at 30.  A standard agreement signed between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits and opportunities afforded to CIOs \"should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled by the University, that the University is responsible for the organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.\" Id., at 26.\n",

The SAF is based on the University's \"recogni[tion] that the availability of a wide range of opportunities\" for its students \"tends to enhance the University environment.\"  App. 26.  The Guidelines require that it be administered \"in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the University as well as with state and federal law.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.  The SAF receives its money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to each full-time student.  The Student Council, elected by the students, has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions are subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for Student Affairs.

One of these is \"student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media groups.\" Id., at 61a.  The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF.  The student activities which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities, philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities, activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt status, those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social entertainment or related expenses.  Id., at 62a-63a. The prohibition on \"political activities\" is defined so that it is limited to electioneering and lobbying.  The Guidelines provide that \"[t]hese restrictions on funding political activities are not intended to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization which . . . espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints, including those that may be unpopular or are not generally accepted.\"  Id., at 65a-66a.

If an organization seeks SAF support, it must submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the organization's creditors upon determining that the expenses are appropriate.  No direct payments are made to the student groups. During the 1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIOs.  One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the SAF, and 118 received funding.

WAP publishes Wide Awake:  A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia.  The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal \"offers a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues, especially those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia.\"  App. 45.  The editors committed the paper to a two-fold mission:  \"to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.\"  Ibid.  The first issue had articles about racism, crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil and free will, and reviews of religious music.  In the next two issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews and interviews with University professors.  Each page of Wide Awake, and the end of each article or review, is marked by a cross.  The advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the Christian perspective of the journal.  For the most part, the advertisers are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores.  By June 1992, WAP had distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake to University students, free of charge.\n",

      "WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a \"religious organization,\" WAP would not have been accorded CIO status.  As defined by the Guidelines, a \"religious organization\" is \"an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.  At no stage in this controversy has the University contended that WAP is such an organization.\n",

It made its determination after examining the first issue.  App. 54. WAP appealed the denial to the full Student Council, contending that WAP met all the applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.  The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed to the next level, the Student Activities Committee.  In a letter signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial of funding.  App. 55.\n",

They alleged that refusal to authorize payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise of religion, and to equal protection of the law.  They relied also upon Article I of the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. §§ 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp.1994), but did not pursue those theories on appeal.

In the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation may not favor one speaker over another. City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2128, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional.  See Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458-2459, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994).  These rules informed our determination that the government offends the First Amendment when it imposes financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of their expression.  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 507-508, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991).  When the government targets not subject matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.  See R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 S.Ct. 2538, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992).  Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious form of content discrimination.  The government must abstain from regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.  See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).\n",

      "These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public forum is one of its own creation.  In a case involving a school district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we declared that \"[t]here is no question that the District, like the private owner of property, may legally preserve the property under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.\"  Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).  The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.  See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985);  Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957.  Once it has opened a limited forum, however, the State must respect the lawful boundaries it has itself set.  The State may not exclude speech where its distinction is not \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum,\" Cornelius, supra, at 804-806, 105 S.Ct. at 3450-51;  see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 49, 103 S.Ct., at 955, 957, nor may it discriminate against speech on the basis of its viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147;  see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955;  R.A.V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393, 112 S.Ct., at ---- - ----, ---- - ----;  cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 414-415, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989).  Thus, in determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between, on the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the other hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations.

      "The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable.  See, e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47, 103 S.Ct., at 955-956 (forum analysis of a school mail system);  Cornelius, supra, at 801, 105 S.Ct., at 3448 (forum analysis of charitable contribution program).  The most recent and most apposite case is our decision in Lamb's Chapel, supra.  There, a school district had opened school facilities for use after school hours by community groups for a wide variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes.  The district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening facilities to groups for religious purposes.  Invoking its policy, the district rejected a request from a group desiring to show a film series addressing various child-rearing questions from a \"Christian perspective.\"  There was no indication in the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the school facilities was \"denied for any reason other than the fact that the presentation would have been from a religious perspective.\"  508 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2145.  Our conclusion was unanimous:  \"[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.\"  Ibid.\n",

      "The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our precedents) that \"ideologically driven attempts to suppress a particular point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in funding, as in other contexts,\" but insists that this case does not present that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on content, not viewpoint.  Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10.  As we have noted, discrimination against one set of views or ideas is but a subset or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content discrimination.  See, e.g., R.A.V., supra, at 391, 112 S.Ct., at ----.  And, it must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise one.  It is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a comprehensive body of thought.  The nature of our origins and destiny and their dependence upon the existence of a divine being have been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human history.  We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel, viewpoint discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's objections to Wide Awake.  By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may be discussed and considered.  The prohibited perspective, not the general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party payments, for the subjects discussed were otherwise within the approved category of publications.\n",

      "The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate is bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response to religious speech.  Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description of the marketplace of ideas.  If the topic of debate is, for example, racism, then exclusion of several views on that problem is just as offensive to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one.  It is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other, or yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint.  The dissent's declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways.\n",

      "The University's denial of WAP's request for third- party payments in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in Lamb's Chapel and that we found invalid.  The church group in Lamb's Chapel would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just as the school district in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views of the group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in this case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake reveal an avowed religious perspective.  See supra, at ____. It bears only passing mention that the dissent's attempt to distinguish Lamb's Chapel is entirely without support in the law.  Relying on the transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to argue that we found viewpoint discrimination in that case because the government excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed in the forum there.  Post, at ____, and n. 13.  The Court relied on no such distinction in holding that discriminating against religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint. There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which, unlike an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law) that exclusion or inclusion of other religious or antireligious voices from that forum had any bearing on its decision.\n",

      "The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds rather than access to facilities.  The University begins with the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to accomplish its educational mission.  Citing our decisions in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), and Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the University argues that content-based funding decisions are both inevitable and lawful.  Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding decisions as well as to those involving access to facilities, it is urged, its holding \"would become a judicial juggernaut, constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make in the allocation of public funds.\"  Brief for Respondents 16.\n",

      "To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v. Vincent, supra.  There, in the course of striking down a public university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated: \"Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources.\"  454 U.S., at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277.  The quoted language in Widmar was but a proper recognition of the principle that when the State is the speaker, it may make content-based choices.  When the University determines the content of the education it provides, it is the University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message.  In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, supra, we upheld the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling. There, the government did not create a program to encourage private speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.  We recognized that when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S., at 194, 111 S.Ct., at 1773.  When the government disburses public funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.  See id., at 196-200, 111 S.Ct., at 1774-1776.\n",
      "\n",

      "21\n",
      "It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar, that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.  A holding that the University may not discriminate based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates does not restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled by different principles.  See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2372, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990);  Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-272, 108 S.Ct. 562, 569-570, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). For that reason, the University's reliance on Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, is inapposite as well.  Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant tax deductions for contributions made to veterans' groups engaged in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to other charities which pursued lobbying efforts.  Although acknowledging that the Government is not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, 103 S.Ct., at 2001, we reaffirmed the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision of financial benefits by observing that \"[t]he case would be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous ideas,' \" see id., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002 (quoting Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S.Ct. 524, 533, 3 L.Ed.2d 462 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 519, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958).  Regan relied on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain speakers—veterans organizations —and not a distinction based on the content or messages of those groups' speech.  461 U.S., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002;  cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957.  The University's regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction as its sole rationale and operative principle.\n",

      "The distinction between the University's own favored message and the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.  The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction in the agreement each CIO must sign.  See supra, at __.  The University declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are not the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and are not its responsibility.  Having offered to pay the third-party contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected viewpoints.\n",

      "The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding of speech differs from provision of access to facilities because money is scarce and physical facilities are not.  Beyond the fact that in any given case this proposition might not be true as an empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its availability is wrong as well.  The government cannot justify viewpoint discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of scarcity.  Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been scarce, had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision would have been no different.  It would have been incumbent on the State, of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on some acceptable neutral principle;  but nothing in our decision indicated that scarcity would give the State the right to exercise viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.\n",

      "Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to examine publications to determine whether or not they are based on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them. The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling of individual thought and expression.  That danger is especially real in the University setting, where the State acts against a background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition.  See Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972);  Keyishian v.

In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna, Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and to learn.  See generally R. Palmer & J. Colton, A History of the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992).  The quality and creative power of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure of a school's influence and attainment.  For the University, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for the nation's intellectual life, its college and university campuses.\n",

      "The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party contractor payments on behalf of WAP effects a sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry in the context of University sponsored publications.  The prohibition on funding on behalf of publications that \"primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,\" in its ordinary and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach.  The term \"promotes\" as used here would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in a deity or ultimate reality.  See Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining \"promote\" as \"to contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of:  further, encourage\").  And the term \"manifests\" would bring within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate reality.  See id., at 1375 (defining \"manifest\" as \"to show plainly:  make palpably evident or certain by showing or displaying\").  Were the prohibition applied with much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes.  And if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx, Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some of their major essays excluded from student publications.  If any manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.  Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point out their (necessary) imperfections.\n",

Indeed, that is the ground on which the University prevailed in the Court of Appeals.  We granted certiorari on this question:  \"Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state university to exclude an otherwise eligible student publication from participation in the student activities fund, solely on the basis of its religious viewpoint, where such exclusion would violate the Speech and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication were nonreligious.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  The University now seems to have abandoned this position, contending that \"[t]he fundamental objection to petitioners' argument is not that it implicates the Establishment Clause but that it would defeat the ability of public education at all levels to control the use of public funds.\"  Brief for Respondents 29; see id., at 27-29, and n. 17;  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.

Recognizing that this Court has regularly \"sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary benefits to religious groups where the government has created open fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited,\" 18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at 277, 102 S.Ct., at 278), the Fourth Circuit asserted that direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects is \"a beast of an entirely different color,\" 18 F.3d, at 286.

It reasoned that because Wide Awake is \"a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion and advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal philosophy,\" the University's provision of SAF funds for its publication would \"send an unmistakably clear signal that the University of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote the wide promulgation of such values.\"  18 F.3d, at 286.\n",

      "A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have decided a series of cases addressing the receipt of government benefits where religion or religious views are implicated in some degree.  The first case in our modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947).  There we cautioned that in enforcing the prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion, we must \"be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the government] from extending its general state law benefits to all its citizens without regard to their religious belief.\"  Id., at 16, 67 S.Ct., at 512.  We have held that the guarantee of neutrality is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are broad and diverse.  See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (SOUTER, J.)

      "The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There is no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a religious cause.  The object of the SAF is to open a forum for speech and to support various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.  The University's SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments on behalf of, \"religious organizations,\" which are those \"whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.\"  Pet. for Cert. 66a.  The category of support here is for \"student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications media groups,\" of which Wide Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year.

      "The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches.  A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to Establishment Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the Republic.  The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the levying of taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing and supporting specific sects.  The exaction here, by contrast, is a student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression is an integral part of the University's educational mission.  The fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether an objecting student has the First Amendment right to demand a pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to which he or she does not subscribe.  See Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 2237, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990);  Abood v.

But the $14 paid each semester by the students is not a general tax designed to raise revenue for the University.  See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (\"A tax, in the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution, signifies an exaction for the support of the Government\");  see also Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596, 5 S.Ct. 247, 252, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884).  The SAF cannot be used for unlimited purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one religion.  Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes to a special fund from which any group of students with CIO status can draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational mission;  and to the extent the student is interested in speech, withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech, whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view, or neither.  Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an expenditure from a general tax fund.  Here, the dis- bursements from the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and effected to provide financial support for a church.\n",

      "Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme in a further meaningful respect.

The Court of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's religious orientation would be attributed to the University is not a plausible fear, and there is no real likelihood that the speech in question is being either endorsed or coerced by the State, see Lee v.

Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976);  Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988);  Hunt v.

Even assuming that WAP is no different from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before it, and the dissent would have us do the same.  We do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity. Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds flow directly to WAP's coffers.\n",

      "It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional exercises.  See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274;  Mergens, 496 U.S., at 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2373.  This is so even where the upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities attributed to those uses is paid from a student activities fund to which students are required to contribute.  Widmar, supra, at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272.  The government usually acts by spending money. Even the provision of a meeting room, as in Mergens and Widmar, involved governmental expenditure, if only in the form of electricity and heating or cooling costs.  The error made by the Court of Appeals, as well as by the dissent, lies in focusing on the money that is undoubtedly expended by the government, rather than on the nature of the benefit received by the recipient.  If the expenditure of governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay for a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel would have to be overruled.  Given our holdings in these cases, it follows that a public university may maintain its own computer facility and give student groups access to that facility, including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say first-come-first-served, basis.  If a religious student organization obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and used a computer to compose or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a religious content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing the group with access would no more violate the Establishment Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly hall.  See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993);  Widmar, supra;  Mergens, supra.  There is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its behalf.  The latter occurs here.  The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as CIOs by reason of their officers and membership.  Any benefit to religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a further degree of separation from the student publication, for it avoids the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep, repair, and replacement attributable to student use, and has a clear record of costs.  As a result, and as in Widmar, the University can charge the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity in question.  It would be formalistic for us to say that the University must forfeit these advantages and provide the services itself in order to comply with the Establishment Clause.  It is, of course, true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing it, and we must guard against this abuse.  That is not a danger here, based on the considerations we have advanced and for the additional reason that the student publication is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used in the University's own regulations.  It is instead a publication involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that would be both incomplete and chilled were the Constitution to be interpreted to require that state officials and courts scan the publication to ferret out views that principally manifest a belief in a divine being.\n",

      "Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the University, in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to scrutinize the content of student speech, lest the expression in question—speech otherwise protected by the Constitution —contain too great a religious content.  The dissent, in fact, anticipates such censorship as \"crucial\" in distinguishing between \"works characterized by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens to express views that a given religion might approve.\"  Post, at ____. That eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship, to ensure that all student writings and publications meet some baseline standard of secular orthodoxy.  To impose that standard on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources of free speech and expression.  As we recognized in Widmar, official censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis.\n",

Such inquiries would tend inevitably to  entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our  cases.  E.g., Walz [v.

The neutrality commanded of the State by the separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the University's course of action.  The viewpoint discrimination inherent in the University's regulation required public officials to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief.  That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion, which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause requires.

This insistence on government neutrality toward religion explains why we have held that schools may not discriminate against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities that the schools make available to all.

Withholding access would leave an impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:  \"the message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;  if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open to others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility toward religion.\"  Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.

It is equally clear that petitioners' viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide Awake is a religious activity, under both the University's regulation and a fair reading of our precedents.

The benefit to religion under the program, therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her government paycheck to the church.  Ibid.

This safeguard accompanying the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the funds are used only to further the University's purpose in maintaining a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from whatever perspective.

      "Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement of the religious message.  Wide Awake does not exist in a vacuum.  It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for advertising and readership.  The widely divergent viewpoints of these many purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the University, significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one publication is perceived as endorsed by the University.  Besides the general news publications, for example, the University has provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor magazine that has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and Al-Salam, a publication to \"promote a better understanding of Islam to the University Community,\" App. 92.  Given this wide array of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints in the forum supported by the University, any perception that the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.

Unlike monies dispensed from state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected from students who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying recipients only from among those who originally paid the fee.  The government neither pays into nor draws from this common pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting individual students proportional refunds.  The Student Activities Fund, then, represents not government resources, whether derived from tax revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that simply belongs to the students.\n",

When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of categorical obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified. The Court today does only what courts must do in many Establishment Clause cases—focus on specific features of a particular government action to ensure that it does not violate the Constitution.  By withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides generally to all other student publications, the University has discriminated on the basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause.  And particular features of the University's program—such as the explicit disclaimer, the disbursement of funds directly to third-party vendors, the vigorous nature of the forum at issue, and the possibility for objecting students to opt out—convince me that providing such assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible use of public funds to endorse Wide Awake's religious message.\n",

      "Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called \"Assessment Controversy\" was indicative of the principles embodied in the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the dissent's conclusion that government must actively discriminate against religion.  The dissent's historical discussion glosses over the fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill that sparked the controversy:  The assessment was to be imposed for the support of clergy in the performance of their function of teaching religion.  Thus, the \"Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion\" provided for the collection of a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be appropriated \"by the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each religious society . . . to a provision for a Minister or Teacher of the Gospel of their denomination, or the providing places of divine worship, and to none other use whatsoever.\"  See Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 539, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).1\n",

      "James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be understood in this context.  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, Madison's objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the premise that religious entities may never participate on equal terms in neutral government programs.  Nor did Madison embrace the argument that forms the linchpin of the dissent:  that monetary subsidies are constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.  Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the neutrality principle that the dissent inexplicably discards.  According to Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed because it \"violate[d] that equality which ought to be the basis of every law.\"  Madison's Remonstrance ¶ 4, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).  The assessment violated the \"equality\" principle not because it allowed religious groups to participate in a generally available government program, but because the bill singled out religious entities for special benefits.  See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated the equality principle \"by subjecting some to peculiar burdens\" and \"by granting to others peculiar exemptions\").\n",

      "Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson to take from the Assessment Controversy.  For some, the experience in Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental preferences for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation of Church and State:  Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23 (1982);  Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again:  A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L.Rev. 569, 590-591 (1984).  Other commentators have rejected this view, concluding that the Establishment Clause forbids not only government preferences for some religious sects over others, but also government preferences for religion over irreligion.  See, e.g., Laycock, \"Nonpreferential\" Aid to Religion:  A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L.Rev. 875, 875 (1986).\n",

      "I find much to commend the former view.  Madison's focus on the preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above.  The funding provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:\n",

      "In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remonstrance, \"Madison's seventh, ninth, eleventh, and twelfth arguments all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance, bigotry, unenlightenment, and persecution that had generally resulted from previous exclusive religious establishments.\"  Cord, supra, at 21.  The conclusion that Madison saw the principle of nonestablishment as barring governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems especially clear in light of statements he made in the more-relevant context of the House debates on the First Amendment.  See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 98, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 2511, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (Madison's views \"as reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate] that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination among sects,\" but not \"as requiring neutrality on the part of government between religion and irreligion\").  Moreover, even if more extreme notions of the separation of church and state can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from \"arguments reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the social contract between government and a civil society,\" Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of nonestablishment in the Constitution.  In any event, the views of one man do not establish the original understanding of the First Amendment.\n",

      "But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this case.  Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that the Establishment Clause \"categorically condemn[s] state programs directly aiding religious activity\" when that aid is part of a neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries.  Post, at ____. Even if Madison believed that the principle of nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial support for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits specifically targeting religion), there is no indication that at the time of the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them from more generally available financial subsidies.2\n",

      "In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against the dissent's suggestion.  In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison prepared an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican Church.  This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and was not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version of disestablishment;  Madison merely wanted the Convention to declare that \"no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,] to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges. . . .\"  Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May 29-June 12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson & W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added).  Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance stressed that \"just government\" is \"best supported by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with the same equal hand which protects his person and his property;  by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering any Sect to invade those of another.\"  Madison's Remonstrance ¶ 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 537;  cf. Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49, 3 L.Ed. 650 (1815) (holding that the Virginia constitution did not prevent the government from \"aiding the votaries of every sect to . . . perform their own religious duties,\" or from \"establishing funds for the support of ministers, for public charities, for the endowment of churches, or for the sepulture of the dead\").\n",

      "Stripped of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument is reduced to the claim that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence permits neutrality in the context of access to government facilities but requires discrimination in access to government funds.  The dissent purports to locate the prohibition against \"direct public funding\" at the \"heart\" of the Establishment Clause, see post, at ____, but this conclusion fails to confront historical examples of funding that date back to the time of the founding.  To take but one famous example, both Houses of the First Congress elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820 ed.);  H.R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that Congress enacted legislation providing for an annual salary of $500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789, ch. 17, § 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71.  Madison himself was a member of the committee that recommended the chaplain system in the House.  See H.R. Jour., at 11-12;  1 Annals of Cong. 891 (1789);  Cord, supra, at 25.  This same system of \"direct public funding\" of congressional chaplains has \"continued without interruption ever since that early session of Congress.\"  Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 788, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3334, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983).3\n",

      "The historical evidence of government support for religious entities through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming.  As the dissent concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies \"have been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause.\"  Post, at ____, n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664, 676-680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415-1417, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)).4 In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary aid to religious groups even when the aid is equally available to other groups.  A tax exemption in many cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.5 In one instance, the government relieves religious entities (along with others) of a generally applicable tax;  in the other, it relieves religious entities (along with others) of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning it in the form of a cash subsidy.  Whether the benefit is provided at the front or back end of the taxation process, the financial aid to religious groups is undeniable.  The analysis under the Establishment Clause must also be the same:  \"Few concepts are more deeply embedded in the fabric of our national life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary colonial times, than for the government to exercise at the very least this kind of benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious exercise. . . .\"  Walz, supra, at 676-677, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.\n",

The dissent admits that \"evenhandedness may become important to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.\"  Post, at ____, n. 5.  Surely the dissent must concede, however, that the same result should obtain whether the government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing the costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or by establishing a public fire department.  If churches may benefit on equal terms with other groups in the latter program that is, if a public fire department may extinguish fires at churches—then they may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.\n",

      "Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray, this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus:  The Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from government benefits programs that are generally available to a broad class of participants.  See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993);  Zobrest, supra;  Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools (Dist. 66) v.

Under the dissent's view, however, the University of Virginia may provide neutral access to the University's own printing press, but it may not provide the same service when the press is owned by a third party.

      "Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to participate in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to the class of \"essential public benefits\" identified by the dissent.  See post, at ____, n. 5.  A broader tradition can be traced at least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.  See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50.  Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress had provided:  \"Religion, morality, and knowledge . . . being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.\"  Id., at 52, n. (a).  Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.  See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, § 1, 2 Stat. 225-226;  Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, § 5, 2 Stat. 279;  Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14, § 10, 2 Stat. 621;  Act of Apr. 18, 1818, ch. 67, § 6, 3 Stat. 430;  Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch. 126, § 2, 3 Stat. 467.  Many of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there was no requirement that the schools be \"public.\"  See C. Antieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment Religion Clauses 163 (1964).  Nevertheless, early Congresses found no problem with the provision of such neutral benefits.  See also id., at 174 (noting that \"almost universally[,] Americans from 1789 to 1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion and religiously oriented educational institutions\").\n",

      "Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been available to religious adherents on neutral terms.

Because there is no warrant for distinguishing among public funding sources for purposes of applying the First Amendment's prohibition of religious establishment, I would hold that the University's refusal to support petitioners' religious activities is compelled by the Establishment Clause.

      "* The central question in this case is whether a grant from the Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses would violate the Establishment Clause.  Although the Court does not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand Establishment Clause scrutiny.  Although the Court places great stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious activities for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that such evenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in a benefit to religion.  Ante, at ____; see also ante, at ____ (O'CONNOR, J., concurring).  Something more is necessary to justify any religious aid.  Some members of the Court, at least, may think the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect, since the money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide Awake's own checking account.  The Court's principal reliance, however, is on an argument that providing religion with economically valuable services is permissible on the theory that services are economically indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech forums, which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyond anything justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums.  The Court implicitly recognizes this in its further attempt to circumvent the clear bar to direct governmental aid to religion.  Different members of the Court seek to avoid this bar in different ways.  The opinion of the Court makes the novel assumption that only direct aid financed with tax revenue is barred, and draws the erroneous conclusion that the involuntary Student Activities Fee is not a tax.  I do not read Justice O'CONNOR'S opinion as sharing that assumption;  she places this Student Activities Fund in a category of student funding enterprises from which religious activities in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no consequent endorsement of religion.

Four years before the First Congress proposed the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy of using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses stand:\n",

      "Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n. 8, 67 S.Ct., at 509, n. 8, the practice having become \"so commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling of abhorrence,\" 330 U.S., at 11, 67 S.Ct., at 509 (footnote omitted).  Madison's Remonstrance captured the colonists' \"conviction that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support, or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with the beliefs of any religious individual or group.\"  Ibid.1  Their sentiment as expressed by Madison in Virginia, led not only to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill, but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson.  That bill's preamble declared that \"to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical,\" Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84-85 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its text provided \"[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever. . . .,\" ibid.  See generally Everson, supra, at 13, 67 S.Ct., at 510. We have \"previously recognized that the provisions of the First Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.\"  Ibid.; see also Laycock, \"Nonpreferential\" Aid to Religion:  A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L.Rev. 875, 921, 923 (1986)  (\"[I]f the debates of the 1780's support any proposition, it is that the Framers opposed government financial support for religion. . . .  They did not substitute small taxes for large taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum.  The principle was what mattered. With respect to money, religion was to be wholly voluntary.  Churches either would support themselves or they would not, but the government would neither help nor interfere\") (footnote omitted);  T.

      "Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear constitutional violation?  The answer must be in part that the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding section.  Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively to Wide Awake's \"Christian viewpoint,\" ante, at ____, or its \"religious perspective,\" ante, at ____, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that \"[Wide Awake] is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense,\" ante, at ____;4  see also ante, at ____. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers.  And so it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.\n",

      "\n",
      "103\n",
      "Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently religious about the magazine to require examination under the Establishment Clause, and one may therefore ask why the unequivocal prohibition on direct funding does not lead the Court to conclude that funding would be unconstitutional.  The answer is that the Court focuses on a subsidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately misapplies.  That subsidiary body of law accounts for the Court's substantial attention to the fact that the University's funding scheme is \"neutral,\" in the formal sense that it makes funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and sectarian applicants alike.  Ante, at ____. While this is indeed true and relevant under our cases, it does not alone satisfy the requirements of the Establishment Clause, as the Court recognizes when it says that evenhandedness is only a \"significant factor\" in certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a dispositive one.  Ante, at ____; see ante, at ____; see also ante, at ____ (O'CONNOR, J., concurring);  id., at ____ (\"Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause\");  Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\"the Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the application of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously oblivious to the effects of its actions. . . .  [N]ot all State policies are permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are neutral in form\").  This recognition reflects the Court's appreciation of two general rules:  that whenever affirmative government aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part;  and that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even if accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at the very heart of the Clause's protection.  See ante, at ____ (\"We do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity\");  ante, at ____; see also ante, at ---- (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)  (\"[Our] decisions . . . provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious activities\").\n",

      "In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those rules in greater detail than the Court does.  As the foregoing quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of evenhandedness when affirmative government aid does result in some benefit to religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal criterion.  At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands the prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of the Clause's application.  Is any government activity that provides any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional?  Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning churches, wrong to pay the bus fares of students on the way to parochial schools, wrong to allow a grantee of special education funds to spend them at a religious college? These are the questions that call for drawing lines, and it is in drawing them that evenhandedness becomes important.  However the Court may in the past have phrased its line-drawing test, the question whether such benefits are provided on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addresses one aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with respect to religion (that is, whether the law either \"advance[s] [or] inhibit[s] religion,\" Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 3100, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)).  In Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), for example, we noted that \"[t]he provision of benefits to [a] broad . . . spectrum of [religious and nonreligious] groups is an important index of secular effect.\"  See also Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).  In the doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding), where there is initially room for argument about a law's effect, evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Evenhandedness is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into the constitutionality of a doubtful law,5 but evenhandedness goes no further.  It does not guarantee success under Establishment Clause scrutiny.\n",

      "Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993), are among the latest of those to illustrate this relevance of evenhandedness when advancement is not so obvious as to be patently unconstitutional.  Each case involved a program in which benefits given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately were used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious institutions.6  In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program at issue.  Witters, supra, at 487-488, 106 S.Ct., at 751;  Mueller, supra, at 397-399, 103 S.Ct. at 3068-3069;  Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2468.  But the significance of evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases, hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.  Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.  Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was the fact that the aid was indirect;  it reached religious institutions \"only as a result of the genuinely independent and private choices of aid recipients,\" Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 752;  see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;  Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469.  In noting and relying on this particular feature of each of the programs at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct funding of religious activities.  See Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469;  Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 752;  see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070.  Thus, our holdings in these cases were little more than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that \"a State may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without constitutional barrier. . . .\"  Witters, supra, at 486-487, 106 S.Ct., at 751.  Such \"attenuated financial benefit[s], ultimately controlled by the private choices of individual[s],\" we have found, are simply not within the contemplation of the Establishment Clause's broad prohibition.  Mueller, supra, at 400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070; see also Witters, supra, at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755 (opinion of O'CONNOR, J.).7\n",

      "Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient condition of constitutionality for direct financial support of religious proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere prohibition against unequal direct aid.  See, e.g., Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 682-684, 91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (striking portion of general aid program providing grants for construction of college and university facilities to the extent program made possible the use of funds for sectarian activities);8 Wolman v.

And nowhere has the Court's adherence to the preeminence of the no-direct-funding principle over the principle of evenhandedness been as clear as in Bowen v.

      "Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act (AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions for counseling and educational services related to adolescent sexuality and pregnancy.  At the time of the litigation, 141 grants had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597, 108 S.Ct., at 2567-2568.  In an Establishment Clause challenge to the Act brought by taxpayers and other interested parties, the District Court resolved the case on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment, holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and also insofar as religious institutions were involved in receiving grants under the Act. When this Court reversed on the issue of facial constitutionality under the Establishment Clause, id., at 602-618, 108 S.Ct., at 2570-2579, we said that there was \"no intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees, religious uses are permitted.\"  Id., at 614, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.  On the contrary, after looking at the legislative history and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure that grants would not be \"used by . . . grantees in such a way as to advance religion.\"  Id., at 615, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.\n",

Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to \"consider . . . whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund 'specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially secular setting.' \"  Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 743, 93 S.Ct., at 2874.  In giving additional guidance to the District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were using materials \"that have an explicitly religious content or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious faith.\"  Ibid.  At no point in our opinion did we suggest that the breadth of potential recipients, or distribution on an evenhanded basis, could have justified the use of federal funds for religious activities, a position that would have made no sense after we had pegged the Act's facial constitutionality to our conclusion that advancement of religion was not inevitable. Justice O'CONNOR's separate opinion in the case underscored just this point:  \"I fully agree . . . that '[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse the religious message.'

      "Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of evenhandedness is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the constitutionality of providing a government benefit that reaches religion, the Court must identify some further element in the funding scheme that does demonstrate its permissibility.  For one reason or another, the Court's chosen element appears to be the fact that under the University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself.

      "* If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest (discussed supra, at ____), the Court has misread those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between the government and a religious institution.  See Witters, 474 U.S., at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751;  see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;  Zobrest, 509 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2469.  Here there is no third party standing between the government and the ultimate religious beneficiary to break the circuit by its independent discretion to put state money to religious use.  The printer, of course, has no option to take the money and use it to print a secular journal instead of Wide Awake.  It only gets the money because of its contract to print a message of religious evangelism at the direction of Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for doing precisely that.  The formalism of distinguishing between payment to Wide Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment of the approved bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of Constitutional law.  If this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution would permit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution;10  in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence to the no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand out credit cards to religious institutions and honor the monthly statements (so long as someone could devise an evenhanded umbrella to cover the whole scheme).  Witters and the other cases cannot be distinguished out of existence this way.\n",

      "It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On this purported justification, the payment to the printer is significant only as the last step in an argument resting on the assumption that a public university may give a religious group the use of any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular groups are likewise eligible.  The Court starts with the cases of Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), in which religious groups were held to be entitled to access for speaking in government buildings open generally for that purpose.  The Court reasons that the availability of a forum has economic value (the government built and maintained the building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall);  and that economically there is no difference between the University's provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the University's printing equipment;  and that therefore the University must be able to provide the use of the latter.  Since it may do that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's own printing equipment.  Ante, at ____.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "116\n",
      "The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon to support it.  The common factual thread running through Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude speakers with religious messages.  See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (forum analysis).  In each case the restriction was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate the content of speech in an open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens) or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's Chapel, see infra, at ____).  In each case, to be sure, the religious speaker's use of the room passed muster as an incident of a plan to facilitate speech generally for a secular purpose, entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk that the religious speech would be taken to be the speech of the government or that the government's endorsement of a religious message would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation Army, the millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker in a public forum.  It was the preservation of free speech on the model of the street corner that supplied the justification going beyond the requirement of evenhandedness.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "117\n",
      "The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is ruled out by the very scope of their holdings.  While they do indeed allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on the recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street corner (even though the State paves the roads and provides police protection to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between the public street corner and open classroom space.  Thus, the Court found it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in traditional speech activities in these forums, too, even though the rooms (like street corners) require some incidental state spending to maintain them.  The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote them, to cover more than forums for literal speaking. There is no traditional street corner printing provided by the government on equal terms to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to a higher plane of generalization without admitting that new economic benefits are being extended directly to religion in clear violation of the principle barring direct aid.  The argument from economic equivalence thus breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it would support is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the service of free speech.  Absent that, the rule against direct aid stands as a bar to printing services as well as printers.\n",

      "It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law, but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways that make further affirmative justification unnecessary. Justice O'CONNOR makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which the activity fee is assessed and distributed.  She concludes that the funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of governmental treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's purview in the absence of a message of religious endorsement (which she finds not to be present).  Ante, at ____-____ (O'Connor, J., concurring).  The opinion of the Court concludes more expansively that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find the aid permissible on the legal assumption that the bar against direct aid applies only to aid derived from tax revenue.  I have already indicated why it is fanciful to treat the fee as anything but a tax, supra, at ____, and n. 3;  see also ante, at ____  (noting mandatory nature of the fee), and will not repeat the point again.

      "Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write in the first instance, the Court has never held that government resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct religious support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues. E.g., School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223 (\"Although Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith\");  Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780, 93 S.Ct., at 2969  (\"In the absence of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral, and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct aid in whatever form is invalid\");  id., at 772, 93 S.Ct., at 2965  (\"Primary among those evils\" against which the Establishment Clause guards \"have been sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity\") (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);  see also T.

American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at 593-594, 109 S.Ct., at 3100-3101, any such use of them would ignore one the dual objectives of the Establishment Clause, which was meant not only to protect individuals and their republics from the destructive consequences of mixing government and religion, but to protect religion from a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.  Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's \"first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion\");  Everson, 330 U.S., at 53, 67 S.Ct., at 529-530 (Rutledge, J., dissenting)  (\"The great condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences, by the state.  For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation it vanishes with the resting\") (citing Madison's Remonstrance &Par; 7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63-72, 67 S.Ct., at 534-539 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.));  School Dist. of Abington v.

Since the corrupting effect of government support does not turn on whether the Government's own money comes from taxation or gift or the sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause could hardly relax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was not implicated.

      "The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is explained by reference to viewpoint.  See Cornelius, supra, at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439  (\"[T]he government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject\").  As when deciding whether a speech restriction is content-based or content-neutral, \"[t]he government's purpose is the controlling consideration.\"  Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989);  see also ibid. (content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech restriction is \"justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech\") (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive noise ordinance by pulling the plug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification system is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because the band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist views.  Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra.  Nor does a municipality's decision to prohibit political advertising on bus placards amount to viewpoint discrimination when in the course of applying this policy it denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor of a particular political candidate.

      "Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to bar the government from skewing public debate.  Other things being equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows one message while prohibiting the messages of those who can reasonably be expected to respond.  See First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978)  (\"Especially where . . . the legislature's suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended\") (footnote omitted);  Madison Joint School Dist.

It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if government assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.\n",

      "There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's application of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under those Guidelines, a \"religious activit[y],\" which is not eligible for funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is \"an activity which primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a. It is clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions was denied funding.  Letter from Student Council to Ronald W. Rosenberger.  App. 54  (\"In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request could not be funded as it is a religious activity\").  The discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at ____, shows beyond any question that it \"primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity . . .,\" in the very specific sense that its manifest function is to call students to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular moral action because of its Christian character.\n",

      "If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that might compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.  But that is not what the regulation authorizes;  it applies to Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.  And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting a particular belief not only \"in\" but \"about\" a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists as well as it does to deists and theists (as the University maintained at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes, see ante, at ____).  The Guidelines, and their application to Wide Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not its competitors.  As understood by their application to Wide Awake, they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that \"primarily promotes or manifests\" any view on the merits of religion;  they deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious apologetics.\n",

      "The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the important point is that even on the Court's own construction the Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination.  In attempting to demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding restrictions might have on learning in our nation's universities, the Court describes the Guidelines as \"a sweeping restriction on student thought and student inquiry,\" disentitling a vast array of topics to funding.  Ante, at ____. As the Court reads the Guidelines to exclude \"any writing that is explicable as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate reality,\" as well as \"those student journalistic efforts which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity and no ultimate reality,\" the Court concludes that the major works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred from the funding forum.  Ante, at ____. The Court goes so far as to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate nothing much more than essays on \"making pasta or peanut butter cookies. . . .\" Ante, at ____.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "129\n",
      "Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court protests.  The Court reads the word \"primarily\" (\"primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality\") right out of the Guidelines, whereas it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens to express views that a given religion might approve, or simply descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a given religion.  But, as I said, that is not the important point. Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restriction's categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction would most certainly not work any impermissible viewpoint discrimination under any prior understanding of that species of content discrimination.  If a University wished to fund no speech beyond the subjects of pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating on the basis of someone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial claim that pasta and cookies did not exist.  The upshot would be an instructional universe without higher education, but not a universe where one viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.\n",

      "With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the basis of viewpoint.  See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (considering as-applied challenge only).  Equally obvious is the distinction between that case and this one, where the regulation is being applied, not to deny funding for those who discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint, but to those engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion and religious observances as such.  If this amounts to viewpoint discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between viewpoint and content.\n",

      "To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded that primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together, always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint to any speech about any secular topic.  Thus, the Court's reasoning requires a university that funds private publications about any primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily espousing adherence to or rejection of religion.  But a university's decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fund publications aimed at urging repentance before God does not skew the debate either about racism or the desirability of religious conversion.  The Court's contrary holding amounts to a significant reformulation of our viewpoint discrimination precedents and will significantly expand access to limited-access forums.  See Greer v.

The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide \"for the support of Christian teachers.\"  Everson, 330 U.S., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539.  Moreover, the section of the bill cited by the dissent, see post, at ____, n. 1, simply indicated that funds would be \"disposed of under the direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,\" Everson, supra, at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540.  This provision disposing of undesignated funds hardly transformed the \"Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion\" into a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference to religion.  Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the bill would have been to promote \"the general diffusion of Christian knowledge,\" id., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539;  any possible appropriation for \"seminaries of learning\" depended entirely on future legislative action.\n",
      "Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian educational institutions.  To the contrary, most schools at the time of the founding were affiliated with some religious organization, see C. Antieau, A. Downey, & E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was no system of public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings of Public Education in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917);  see also A. Johnson, The Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States 4 (1982)  (\"In Virginia the parish institutions transported from England were the earliest educational agencies.  Although much of the teaching took place in the home and with the aid of tutors, every minister had a school, and it was the duty of the vestry to see that all the poor children were taught to read and write\") (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation of residual funds to sectarian \"seminaries of learning.\"  Finally, although modern historians have focused on the opt-out provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed the Virginia assessment as an evenhanded program;  in fact, several of the objections expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63, 67 S.Ct., at 534-535, focus clearly on the bill's violation of the principle of \"equality,\" or evenhandedness.

Respondent's exclusion of religious activities from SAF funding creates this very problem.  It requires University officials to classify publications as \"religious activities,\" and to discriminate against the publications that fall into that category.  Such a policy also contravenes the principles expressed in Madison's Remonstrance by encouraging religious adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus \"degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.\"  Id. ¶ 9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69, 67 S.Ct., at 537.\n",

      " The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment Controversy itself is inconsistent with the rigid \"no-aid\" principle embraced by the dissent.  Since at least 1777, the Virginia legislature authorized tax exemptions for property belonging to the \"commonwealth, or to any county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or seminary of learning.\"  Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, § 1, 1800 Va.Acts.  And even Thomas Jefferson, respondent's founder and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology in conjunction with other professional schools.  See S. Padover, The Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943);  see also id., at 958 (noting that Jefferson advocated giving \"to the sectarian schools of divinity the full benefit [of] the public provisions made for instruction in the other branches of science\").\n",

      " In the tax literature, this identity is called a \"tax expenditure,\" a concept \"based upon recognition of the fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person or group by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms.  For example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him.  The government can send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his income, or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by $23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000].  If the direct payment were itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket, the preacher would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction as he would from the direct payment.\"  Wolfman, Tax Expenditures:  From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985).  In fact, Congress has provided a similar \"tax expenditure\" in § 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a \" 'minister of the gospel' \" an unlimited exclusion for the rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the rental allowance paid to him.  See id., at 492, n. 6.\n",
      "Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at __, n. 7, is misplaced in this context.  See Adler, The Internal Revenue Code, The Constitution, and the Courts:  The Use of Tax Expenditure Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 855, 862, n. 30 (1993):\n",
      "\"Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on the difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is not a special provision.  Professor Boris Bittker, for example, argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any tax could not be described as the equivalent of subsidies.  Boris I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J. 1285 (1969).  This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis was short-lived and attracted few supporters.  Rather, the large body of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies.  The current debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly identified as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions are more efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than direct spending programs.

      " Justice THOMAS suggests that Madison would have approved of the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle of evenhandedness.  Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy program.  Indeed, while Justice THOMAS claims that the \"funding provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to Christian sects,\" ante, at ____, it is clear that the bill was more general in scope than this.  While the bill, which is reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 538-540, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided that each taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted his levy paid, id., at 73, 67 S.Ct., at 539, it would also have allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any religious society, in which case the legislature was to use these unappropriated sums to fund \"seminaries of learning.\"  Id., at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540 (contrary to Justice THOMAS's unsupported assertion, this portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other).  While some of these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally understood at the time to be \"any school, academy, college or university, in which young persons are instructed in the several branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments.\"  N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st ed. 1828);  see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary 956 (2d ed.1989).  Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally agreed that the bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools.  See, e.g., Laycock, \"Nonpreferential\" Aid to Religion:  A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. & Mary L.Rev. 875, 897 (1986) (\"Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church, with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools . . . The bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the training of ministers\");  T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) (\"The assessment had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support education rather than religion to do so\");  T. Curry, The First Freedoms 141 (1986) (\"[T]hose taxes not designated for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education\").  It is beside the point that \"there was no system of public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment bill was proposed,\" ante, at ____, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring);  because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have made available for secular, public schools never materialized.  The fact that the bill, if passed, would have funded secular as well as religious instruction did nothing to soften Madison's opposition to it.\n",
      "Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because it treated religious groups unequally.  Ante, at ____ (THOMAS, J., concurring).  In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions, Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536, but to identify this factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the bill is unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text.  Madison strongly inveighed against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of those reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid was being distributed equally among sects, and whether or not the aid was going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded government program.  See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted in Everson, 330 U.S., at 64, 67 S.Ct., at 535, ¶ 1 (\"[I]n matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society, and . . . Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance\");  id., at 67, 67 S.Ct., at 536-537, ¶ 6 (arguing that State support of religion \"is a contradiction to the Christian Religion itself;  for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers of this world\");  ibid., ¶ 7 (\"[E]xperience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation\").  Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous other petitions in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that the lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw.  L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed.1994).  For example, the petition that received the largest number of signatories was motivated by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily.  Id., at 63-64.  Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal basis, and the outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of the Virginia assessment was not such a bill;  rather, it was the Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed in the text, proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes.\n",

      " Justice THOMAS attempts to cast doubt on this accepted version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical facts that are largely inapposite.  Ante, at ____, (concurring opinion).  As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress, especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as an authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses, for \"like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses] could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs on them the next.  [For example,] . . . [t]en years after proposing the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards.  If the early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room for political censorship.\"  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 626, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2676, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (concurring opinion). The legislation cited by Justice THOMAS, including the Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the Alien and Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment.  Even less persuasive, then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating from the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument, they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on the Framers' intent.\n",
      "Justice THOMAS's references to Madison's actions as a legislator also provide little support for his cause.  Justice THOMAS seeks to draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities.  Ante, at ____ (concurring opinion).  That was not the task at hand, however.  Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years later.  That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone too far.  Ibid.\n",
      "Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides no support for more general principles that run counter to settled Establishment Clause jurisprudence.  As I have previously pointed out, Madison, upon retirement, \"insisted that 'it was not with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' \"  Lee, supra, at 625, n. 6, 112 S.Ct., at 2675, n. 6, quoting Letter from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders' Constitution, at 105.  And when we turned our attention to deciding whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a larger class of permissible government funding of religious activities.  Instead, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3335-3336, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular, 200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that \"[t]his unique history\" justified carving out an exception for the specific practice in question.  Given that the decision upholding this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it a broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.\n",

In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable to \"a broad class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasipublic corporations,\" id., at 673, 90 S.Ct., at 1413, but did not rest on that factor alone.  Critical to our decision was the central principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited under the Establishment Clause.  \"It is sufficient to note that for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment the 'establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity.\"  Id., at 668, 90 S.Ct., at 1411. We emphasized that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government funds in support of religious activities.  \"The grant of a tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from demanding that the church support the state.\"  Id., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.  Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation context, \"exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote involvement between church and state and far less than taxation of churches,\" and in operation \"ten[d] to complement and reinforce the desired separation insulating\" church and state, id., at 676, 90 S.Ct., at 1415;  and that religious property tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id., at 676-680, 90 S.Ct., at 1415-1417.\n",

The equivalence (asserted by Justice THOMAS, ante, at ____) between a direct money subsidy and the tax liability avoided by an institution (because it is part of the class of institutions that defines the relevant tax base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched long ago by Professor Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J. 1285 (1969).  Justice THOMAS's suggestion that my \"reliance on Bittker . . . is misplaced in this context,\" ante, at ____, n. 5, is not on point.  Even granting that Justice THOMAS's assertion of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the fact that the Court in Walz explicitly distinguished tax exemptions from direct money subsidies, 397 U.S., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1414, and rested its decision on that distinction.  If Justice THOMAS's assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court necessarily was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding.

Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 15-19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-635, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam ), and although it is the student speakers who choose which particular messages to advance in the forum created by the University, the initial act of defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision attributable to the University, not the students.  In any event, even assuming that private and state speech always may be separated by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed infra, this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination.\n",

      " I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech Clause.  If, however, the determinations are made on the basis of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint distinction, there is no violation.  In a limited-access forum, a speech restriction must be \"reasonable in light of the purpose served by the forum\" as well as viewpoint-neutral.  E.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147, quoting Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439.  Because petitioners have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable, I express no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that it applies in limited-access forum cases.\n",

      "LEE H. ROSENTHAL, District Judge.\n",
      "This case again requires analysis of the delicate balance that public school administrators must strike between protecting the First Amendment right to free speech and avoiding endorsing religion in violation of the Establishment Clause. The many cases and the large body of literature on this set of issues demonstrate the lack of adequate guidance to enable teachers and principals to determine whether the decisions they make comply with constitutional standards.[1] As this case demonstrates, decisions in such seemingly innocuous and benign activities as elementary school parties and fundraisers for elementary school art classes too often lead to protracted litigation.\n",
      "The plaintiffs in this case are parents of students at Pattison Elementary School in the Katy Independent School District (the \"KISD\"), the remaining defendant. Since this case was filed in 2006, the claims have been steadily whittled down by this court's orders and the parties' agreements. On December 30, 2009, this court issued a Memorandum and Order addressingon stipulated factsthe only two remaining claims. (Docket Entry No. 58). The first was an as-applied challenge to the time, place, and manner restrictions the school *639 placed on student-to-student distribution of nonschool literature, including religious literature, on the Pattison Elementary School campus. This court held that as a matter of law, the KISD's restrictions were constitutional. The second issue was the plaintiffs' challenge to the school's blacking out one of twelve preset messages on an order form sent home with the children as a fundraising project. The form allowed parents to order from a third-party vendor holiday cards featuring their child's artwork, accompanied by one of the preset messages. The only preset message the school blacked out was a quote from the New Testament. The other messages sounded more secular themes of the holiday season. The parties stipulated that the KISD blacked out this one message \"because of its particular religious viewpoint\" in an effort to \"avoid violating the Establishment Clause.\" (Docket Entry No. 50, Ex. B at 4). This court granted summary judgment to the school district, finding that no violation of the Establishment Clause was presented. (Docket Entry No. 59).\n",
      "The plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration of the second part of the December 30 opinion, on the holiday art-card order form. The plaintiffs do not dispute this court's conclusion as to the Establishment Clause but argue that they did not claim a violation of that Clause. Instead, the plaintiffs argue that the KISD's admitted viewpoint discrimination in blacking out the one explicitly religious message violated their First Amendment free speech rights and was not justified by the District's desire to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. (Docket Entry No. 60). The KISD has responded. (Docket Entry No. 61).\n",
      "Based on a careful review of the reconsideration motion and response; the summary judgment motions, responses, and replies; the summary judgment record; and the applicable law, this court grants the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration and analyzes the First Amendment claim. Having done so, this court concludes that the speech is subject to First Amendment review; that the admitted viewpoint discrimination violated the First Amendment; and the asserted justificationavoiding a possible violation of the Establishment Clausedoes not absolve the constitutional violation. The plaintiffs are ordered to submit an amended final judgment no later than August 20, 2010. The reasons for this ruling are explained below.\n",
      "\n",
      "I. The Summary Judgment Record\n",
      "To raise funds to buy supplies for art classes, Pattison Elementary made student artwork available for parents and friends to purchase as \"art holiday cards\" through a company called \"Its My Artwork\" (sic). The KISD sent the company's order form, with the name \"Pattison Elementary\" and the names of the art teachers written at the top, home with the children. The parents completed the form and wrote a check to Pattison Elementary to order cards. The completed cards had nothing that indicated any connection to the school or the KISD. The cards were intended to be sent by the parents to whomever they chose, not by the school.\n",
      "The parties stipulated to the following facts:\n",
      " As part of the card ordering process, the students created their own artwork. The students['] own expression and artwork was printed in the holiday cards so that the students created personalized holiday cards. Various messages were available on the order from for the students to choose to accompany their personalized holiday artwork expression.\n",
      "\n",
      "*640  The fundraiser was sponsored by Pattison Elementary.\n",
      " The purpose of the fundraiser was to raise money to purchase additional supplies for art class.\n",
      " The blacked out box (\"Box F\") on the fundraiser order form originally read \"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He shall save his people from their sins. Matthew 1:21.\"\n",
      " The District blacked out Block F because of its particular religious viewpoint. School officials blacked out Box F because it was the only box that referenced a specific deity and a specific religious quote from a religious book, and the District was trying to avoid violating the Establishment Clause.\n",
      "(Id., Ex. B at 4).\n",
      "The company-supplied order form with Box F redacted is part of the record. At the top are three blank lines. \"Pattison Elem.\" is handwritten in the line marked \"School/Organization.\" The line for \"Artist's name\" is blank. Under \"Teacher/Other contact,\" someone wrote by hand the names \"Jennifer Walker\" and \"Sandy Hill,\" who were Pattison Elementary's art teachers. (Id., Ex. K). The order form contains text stating in part: \"This year we are taking orders for Note Cards, Holiday Cards, and Bookmarkers as part of our annual fundraising activities. Its My Artwork (sic) will make these unique items from this child's personal artwork.\" (Id., Ex. K (emphasis removed)). The URL for the company's website is included. Checks were to be made payable to \"your school or organization.\" (Id.). The vendor, Its My Artwork, apparently provided this service to many schools and organizations, using the same form with the same preset text.[2]\n",
      "After the KISD marked through the Box F message, the preset messages from which the purchaser could choose were:\n",
      " Wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year\n",
      " Peace on Earth/Let it begin in our hearts.\n",
      " May your holiday spirit last forever. Happy Holidays!\n",
      " The gift of lovethe gift of peacethe gift of happiness. May these be yours at Christmas.\n",
      " Christmas is for children! Fortunately there's a little child in all of us! Have a very Merry Christmas\n",
      " May the lights of Chanukah/Fill your home with joy!\n",
      " Happy Chanukah\n",
      " Happy Chanukah! May the peace and joy of the season be with you and yours.\n",
      " Feliz Navidad y Prospero Año Nuevo\n",
      " May the ancestors bless you with a deep sense of heritage; Best Wishes for Kwanzaa\n",
      " Happy Kwanzaa/Celebrate Family, Community and Culture\n",
      "(Id.).\n",
      "Both parties moved for summary judgment on the constitutionality of the *641 school's decision to black out Box F. This court granted the KISD's motion and denied the plaintiffs' motion on that issue, finding no Establishment Clause violation. The plaintiffs have moved for reconsideration, (Docket Entry No. 60), and the KISD has responded, (Docket Entry No. 61). The plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration argues that the proper analysis is under the First Amendment free speech clause, and challenges the very brief statement in footnote 9 of the December 30, 2009 Memorandum and Order that the art card order forms were government speech, not private speech.\n",
      "The parties' briefing on the reconsideration motion has sharpened the issues implicated by art card fundraiser. The plaintiffs contend that the art-card program is private speech, not government speech or school-sponsored speech governed by Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). The KISD urges this court to focus on the order form and hold that it was government speech. Neither party argues that Hazelwood readily or fully applies to this case but they disagree as to whether Hazelwood would permit the school's decision to black out Box F. Finally, the parties dispute whether a government interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation can justify restricting speech on the basis of the viewpoint it expresses and, if so, whether such a justification was present here. These issues are analyzed below.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. The Legal Standard\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Motions for Reconsideration\n",
      "The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not specifically provide for motions for reconsideration. Shepherd v. International Paper Co., 372 F.3d 326, 328 (5th Cir. 2004); see also St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Fair Grounds Corp., 123 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1997). Reconsideration motions are generally analyzed under the standards for a motion to alter or amend judgment under Rule 59(e) or a motion for relief from a judgment or order under Rule 60(b). Hamilton Plaintiffs v. Williams Plaintiffs, 147 F.3d 367, 371 n. 10 (5th Cir.1998). Rule 59(e) governs when the reconsideration motion is filed within 28 days of the challenged order or when the motion seeks reconsideration of an interlocutory order. Steadfast Ins. Co. v. SMX 98, Inc., No. 06-2736, 2009 WL 3190452 (S.D.Tex. Sept. 28, 2009) (drawing the line at 10 days instead of 28 days because the case was decided before the amendments to Rule 59 took effect on December 1, 2009). The plaintiffs moved for reconsideration 28 days after the summary judgment order, meaning that the motion falls under Rule 59(e).\n",
      "A Rule 59(e) motion \"calls into question the correctness of a judgment.\" Templet v. HydroChem Inc., 367 F.3d 473, 478-79 (5th Cir.2004) (citing In re Transtexas Gas Corp., 303 F.3d 571, 581 (5th Cir.2002)). under Rule 59(e) `must clearly establish either a manifest error of law or fact or must present newly discovered evidence' and `cannot be used to raise arguments which could, and should, have been made before the judgment issued.'\" Rosenzweig v. Azurix Corp., 332 F.3d 854, 863-64 (5th Cir.2003) (quoting Simon v. United States, 891 F.2d 1154, 1159 (5th Cir.1990)). Relief is also appropriate when there has been an intervening change in the controlling law. Schiller v. Physicians Resource Group Inc., 342 F.3d 563, 567 (5th Cir. 2003). The Fifth Circuit warns that altering, amending, or reconsidering a judgment under Rule 59(e) is an extraordinary remedy that courts should use sparingly. Templet, 367 F.3d at 479; see also 11 CHARLES A. WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER & MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE *642 § 2810.1, at 124 (2d ed. 1995). The Rule 59(e) standard \"favors denial of motions to alter or amend a judgment.\" S. Constructors Group, Inc. v. Dynalectric Co., 2 F.3d 606, 611 (5th Cir.1993).\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Summary Judgment\n",
      "Summary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. FED. R. CIV. P. 56(c). \"The movant bears the burden of identifying those portions of the record it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\" Triple Tee Golf, Inc. v. Nike, Inc., 485 F.3d 253, 261 (5th Cir. 2007) (citing Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-25, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)).\n",
      "If the burden of proof at trial lies with the nonmoving party, the movant may satisfy its initial burden by \"`showing'that is, pointing out to the district courtthat there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case.\" See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S.Ct. 2548. While the party moving for summary judgment must demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact, it does not need to negate the elements of the nonmovant's case. Boudreaux v. Swift Transp. Co., 402 F.3d 536, 540 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). \"A fact is `material' if its resolution in favor of one party might affect the outcome of the lawsuit under governing law.\" Sossamon v. Lone Star State of Texas, 560 F.3d 316, 326 (5th Cir.2009) (quotation omitted). \"If the moving party fails to meet [its] initial burden, the motion [for summary judgment] must be denied, regardless of the nonmovant's response.\" United States v. $92,203.00 in U.S. Currency, 537 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting Little v. Liquid Air Corp., 37 F.3d 1069, 1075 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc)).\n",
      "When the moving party has met its Rule 56(c) burden, the nonmoving party cannot survive a summary judgment motion by resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings. The nonmovant must identify specific evidence in the record and articulate how that evidence supports that party's claim. Baranowski v. Hart, 486 F.3d 112, 119 (5th Cir.2007). \"This burden will not be satisfied by `some metaphysical doubt as to the material facts, by conclusory allegations, by unsubstantiated assertions, or by only a scintilla of evidence.'\" Boudreaux, 402 F.3d at 540 (quoting Little, 37 F.3d at 1075). In deciding a summary judgment motion, the court draws all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Connors v. Graves, 538 F.3d 373, 376 (5th Cir.2008).\n",
      "The moving party bears a heavier burden when seeking summary judgment on a claim or defense on which it would bear the burden of proof at trial. Fontenot v. Upjohn Co., 780 F.2d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir. 1986). \"[I]f the movant bears the burden of proof on an issue, either because he is the plaintiff or as a defendant he is asserting an affirmative defense, he must establish beyond peradventure all of the essential elements of the claim or defense to warrant judgment in his favor.\" Id. (emphasis in original); see also Meecorp Capital Markets LLC v. Tex-Wave Industries LP, 265 Fed.Appx. 155, 157 (5th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (unpublished) (quoting Fontenot, 780 F.2d at 1194).\n",
      "\n",
      "III. Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "A. Whose Speech Was This? Government or Private Speech\n",
      "The documents that make up the art-card fundraiser raise questions about three recognized categories of speech: government speech, private speech, and school-sponsored speech. The government *643 may restrict its own speech, which includes speech expressed by others under government control, without implicating the Free Speech Clause. Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 1125, 1131, 172 L.Ed.2d 853 (2009). Generally, the government may restrict only the time, place, and manner of private speech although, depending on the type of forum, other restrictions may be permissible. See id. at 1132; Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 66, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). School-sponsored speech is a third category devised for the distinctive context of the public school. It is neither pure government speech nor pure private speech, but rather student expression that \"may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum,\" which means that it is \"supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences.\" Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 271, 108 S.Ct. 562, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988). Such speech may be regulated by the school \"so long as editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school sponsored expressive activities is reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\" Id. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562.[3]\n",
      "A split exists among the circuit courts as to whether Hazelwood requires that school regulation of school-sponsored speech to be viewpoint neutral. Compare Fleming v. Jefferson County Sch. Dist., 298 F.3d 918, 926-28 (10th Cir.2002) (viewpoint neutrality not required), and Ward v. Hickey, 996 F.2d 448, 454 (1st Cir.1993) (same), with Searcey v. Harris, 888 F.2d 1314, 1319 n. 7, 1325 (11th Cir.1989) (viewpoint neutrality required), and Planned Parenthood of S. Nev., Inc. v. Clark Co. Sch. Dist., 941 F.2d 817, 830 (9th Cir.1991) (en banc) (same). The Fifth Circuit has not resolved this issue. See Chiras v. Miller, 432 F.3d 606, 615 n. 27 (5th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has not decided whether \"a State's interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would justify viewpoint discrimination.\" Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.S. 98, 113, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001).\n",
      "The threshold issue is whether the order form that the KISD redacted was government speech or private speech. The plaintiffs argue that by participating in the art card program, including sending the order forms to parents, Pattison Elementary created a forum for student expression but did not determine the content of that expression so as to create government speech. The plaintiffs argue that the District is \"merely paying a third-party vendor (It's My Artwork) to print the private art work of students along with the privately chosen messages of individual card purchasers,\" so that \"the District has no authority to censor the private viewpoints either of the students or the purchasers.\" (Docket Entry No. 60 at 12 (emphasis in original)). The KISD responds that the order form it sent home from school with the students must be viewed separately, and the order form was government speech.\n",
      "*644 The plaintiffs emphasize that private speech facilitated by government funding or supervision does not thereby become government speech. In Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), for example, the Supreme Court struck down the University of Virginia's refusal to allocate any of its student publication funds to a particular publication because of its religious Christian message. The Court held that the university had created a limited public forum for expression by making funds available for student publications. Although the university facilitated the private speech by funding it, the speech was the students' speech, not the university's. Id. at 833-36, 115 S.Ct. 2510. University officials made the publication funds available not so students could promote the university's message but rather to \"encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.\" Id. at 834, 115 S.Ct. 2510. The university had asked the student groups who wanted to use university funds to pay outside vendors to sign a statement that the benefits given to them \"should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled by the University, that the University is responsible for the organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.\" Id. at 824, 115 S.Ct. 2510. This demonstrated to the Court that the individual groups chose their own messages. \"Having offered to pay the third-party contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own messages,\" the Court held, \"the University may not silence the expression of selected viewpoints.\" Id. at 834-35, 115 S.Ct. 2510.\n",
      "Similarly, in Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001), the Supreme Court held unconstitutional a restriction in the Legal Services Corporation (\"LSC\") Act that prevented attorneys receiving funding under the statute from accepting a legal representation that involved an effort to amend or otherwise challenge welfare law. As the Court reasoned, \"[a]lthough the LSC program differs from the program at issue in Rosenberger in that its purpose is not to `encourage a diversity of views,' the salient point is that, like the program in Rosenberger, the LSC program was designed to facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message.\" Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 542, 121 S.Ct. 1043. LSC lawyers spoke on behalf of their clients, not on behalf of the government. Because the government had provided a subsidy rather than created a forum, the Court found that the limited-forum cases were not strictly controlling but were instructive. Although those cases permitted some restrictions on speech, the government hadfor reasons not relevant to the present casegone too far in preventing LSC attorneys from advocating change to the welfare system. Id. at 540-49, 121 S.Ct. 1043.\n",
      "Rosenberger and Velazquez limit the extent to which the government can create a program to facilitate private speech and then restrict the message conveyed by the private speaker based on viewpoint. The parties agree that in determining whether speech is the government's, the \"key inquiry is the `degree of governmental control over the message,'\" that \"[s]peech constitutes government speech when it is `effectively controlled' by the government.\" Pelts & Skins, LLC v. Landreneau, 448 F.3d 743, 743 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting Johanns v. Livestock Mktg., Assoc., 544 U.S. 550, 125 S.Ct. 2055, 2062-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 896 (2005)).\n",
      "In Johanns, the Supreme Court explained that speech is the government's when \"the government sets the overall *645 message to be communicated and approves every word that is disseminated,\" even when the government \"solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in developing specific messages.\" Johanns, 544 U.S. at 562, 125 S.Ct. 2055. In that case, Congress had directed the Secretary of Agriculture to impose a mandatory assessment on beef producers, which would be used to promote the consumption of beef by creating an advertising campaign. Congress directed the Secretary to create an industry operating committee that would create advertising materials, the content of which was subject to the approval of the Secretary. Without considering whether the operating committee was a governmental entity, the Court rejected the argument that the resulting advertisements were private speech because it found that the \"message of the promotional campaigns [was] effectively controlled by the Federal Government itself.\" Id. at 560, 125 S.Ct. 2055. The message was \"from beginning to end the message established by the Federal Government\" because the campaign was implemented at the behest of Congress and the Agriculture Secretary, all parties involved in developing the message were answerable to and/or appointed by the Secretary, the Agriculture Department reviewed every proposed campaign, the Department staff participated in developing campaigns, and the Secretary \"exercise[ed] final approval authority over every word used in every promotional campaign.\" Id. at 560-61, 125 S.Ct. 2055.\n",
      "The District argues that the art-card order form must be viewed separately and that it is government speech. The plaintiffs argue that the order form must be viewed as part of the art-card program, which was private speech. Neither argument is wholly correct. The order form was a separate document, but it is properly analyzed in the context of the art-card program it facilitated. The order form was clearly written by Its My Artwork, a third-party vendor. The vendor had selected the twelve preset message options for the parents to choose the one they wanted in the cards they purchased. The order form made it clear that the vendor made these selections, not the school. The form made it clear that the parents were to select the art work they wanted and the accompanying message from the options provided.\n",
      "The only changes the school made to the order form other than redacting Box F were to identify the school and the art teachers. The art-card program was to create holiday cards using the children's own artwork, selected by the parents, accompanied by the parents' choice among the preset messages, to be sent by the parents. Unlike the Secretary of Agriculture in Johanns, the school was not using the program, including the order form, to \"promote a particular policy of its own,\" or \"to convey a governmental message.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833, 115 S.Ct. 2510. In Johanns, the Court held that \"[w]hen, as here, the government sets the overall message to be communicated and approves every word that is disseminated, it is not precluded from relying on the government-speech doctrine merely because it solicits assistance from nongovernmental sources in developing specific messages.\" 544 U.S. at 562, 125 S.Ct. 2055. In this case, even though the school did not simply leave it entirely to the parents to pick any message they wanted, the school did not set the \"overall message to be communicated\" or \"approve every word that is disseminated\" in the cards; that was up to the parents who chose the combination of the art work for the cards and the accompanying message.\n",
      "Nor do the facts of this case show government speech under the analysis in Arkansas Education Television Commission *646 v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998). In that case, the Supreme Court held that a state-owned, public broadcaster engages in its own \"speech activity\" when exercising editorial control over its broadcast. The Court compared the ordinary editorial decisions of a public broadcaster to \"a university selecting a commencement speaker, a public institution selecting speakers for a lecture series, or a public school prescribing its curriculum.\" Id. at 674, 118 S.Ct. 1633. In such situations, judicial review is inappropriate because it would interfere with the editorial discretion inherent in the nature of the medium, which requires selecting or excluding certain private speech on the basis of its content and viewpoint. Rather than finding that the television station was a forum in which the broadcaster was entitled to discriminate on the basis of viewpoint, the Court decided that the public broadcaster's exercise of \"editorial discretion and presentation of its programming\" was itself government speech not subject to the Free Speech Clause. When the broadcaster held a televised debate for political candidates, however, it had opened a nonpublic forum in which its regulations had to be viewpoint neutral. Id. at 678-82, 118 S.Ct. 1633; see also Chiras v. Miller, 432 F.3d 606, 616 (5th Cir.2005) (describing Forbes as holding that \"a political candidate[s'] debate is an exception to the general rule that state-owned media engages in government speech by selecting and broadcasting programs\").\n",
      "Similarly, in Chiras, 432 F.3d at 614-15, the Fifth Circuit held that the Texas State Board of Education engaged in its own speech when selecting textbooks for the official curriculum. \"When the [Board] devises the state curriculum for Texas and selects the textbook with which teachers will teach to the students, it is the state speaking, and not the textbook author.\" Id. at 614. It was \"necessary for the Board to exercise editorial judgment,\" the exercise of which \"will necessarily reflect the viewpoint of the Board members.\" Id. at 615. Rather than \"establish a forum for the expression of the views the various authors of textbooks and other instructional materials might want to interject into the classroom\" or \"encourage a `diversity of views,'\" as in Rosenberger, the Board \"`enlist[ed] private entities to convey its own message.'\" Id. at 615 (quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833-34, 115 S.Ct. 2510); see also Nat'l Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998) (holding that an art grant program requiring the NEA to judge the content of proposed projects did not implicate a free speech analysis because the very nature of the NEA is to judge the merits of artists' work); United States v. Am. Library Ass'n, Inc., 539 U.S. 194, 123 S.Ct. 2297, 156 L.Ed.2d 221 (2003) (declining to apply free speech review to a statute conditioning federal library funding on the libraries' use of internet content filters on public computers because it would be \"incompatible with the discretion that public libraries must have to fulfill their traditional missions\").\n",
      "In the present case, in sending the art-card order form home to the parents of elementary art students, Pattison Elementary was not acting like \"a university selecting a commencement speaker, a public institution selecting speakers for a lecture series, or a public school prescribing its curriculum.\" See Forbes, 523 U.S. at 674, 118 S.Ct. 1633. To the contrary, the school merely sent a third-party's order form home to invite interested parents to create a holiday card using their child's own art and one of several messages the vendor provided. The order form invited parents and children to create holiday cards that would be sent privately, with no evident connection to the school. This is *647 far removed from the \"traditional mission\" of a public school exemplified in such activities as choosing textbooks or a commencement speaker.\n",
      "For similar reasons, the KISD's reliance on Warnock v. Archer, 380 F.3d 1076 (8th Cir.2004), is not persuasive. That case addressed a school superintendent's practice of conducting prayers at mandatory teacher-training meetings and requiring teachers to attend inservice meetings at a local religious college where a prayer was offered. The prayers offered were, in the court's words, \"official prayers,\" offered at \"official\" school functions. Id. at 1081. Sending a third-party order form home with an invitation for parents to participate in a fundraiser that benefits the school but is otherwise separate from it presents a far different case. The fact that the school sent the order form to the parents does not make the contents of the form pure government speech. It was evident that the form was prepared by a third party and that it was the third party that created the twelve preset messages for the parents to choose. The transmittal of the form, including the message options it included, did not make that form or those messages government speech. The form created a forum for, or facilitated, the creation of the cards, which was clearly private expression. The school did not use the vendor to transmit specific information pertaining to the creation of the school's own message or policy; this was a fundraising program used by many other organizations of various types.\n",
      "Failing to redact one of the preset messages would not have made it the school's own message. Sending a third-party vendor's order form home with children, for a program that will not take place at school and when completed will not have a visible connection to the school, is far different from presenting a specific speaker for a graduation ceremony or other official event at the school, or from sponsoring student work that will be permanently affixed to the school. Cf. Forbes, 523 U.S. at 674, 118 S.Ct. 1633 (suggesting that a University engages in its own speech by selecting a commencement speaker and that any public institution does so by selecting speakers for a lecture series); Fleming v. Jefferson Cnty. Sch. Dist. R-1, 298 F.3d 918, 923-24 (10th Cir.2002) (refusing to hold that even tiles designed by students and permanently affixed to the school constituted government speech; finding them to be school-sponsored speech governed by Hazelwood); Downs v. Los Angeles Unified Sch. Dist., 228 F.3d 1003, 1015-17 (9th Cir.2000) (holding that a teacher's posting anti-gay literature on a hallway bulletin board was government speech because the bulletin boards at the school were \"vehicles for conveying a message from the school district\").\n",
      "The facts that the vendor preselected twelve separate message options in the order form and did not allow the parents and students complete license to say whatever they wanted in the printed text of the cards did not make the order formor the cards it was used to creategovernment speech. The school was not setting the overall message to be communicated in the cards that the parents would create using the order form. Nor was the school approving every word that would be disseminated when the parents sent the cards. The order form facilitated speech by the parents and students. The order form cannot properly be viewed as entirely separate from the forum it created or as pure government speech, as the KISD argues.[4]\n",
      "*648 There is simply too loose and attenuated a connection between the order form, the cards it was used to create, and the school's role to make the art-card form pure government speech exempt from First Amendment analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "B. Does a Hazelwood Analysis Apply?\n",
      "The Supreme Court has identified a third, hybrid category of speech in public school cases, school-sponsored speech, or Hazelwood speech, after the case that first recognized it. See Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 270-73, 108 S.Ct. 562. Because the speech at issue is not pure government speech, and because the doctrines overlap to such a great extent, see Morse, 551 U.S. at 429-30, 127 S.Ct. 2618 (Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part), a Hazelwood analysis is appropriate for the sake of completeness. The KISD argues that if the speech is not pure government speech, it may be analyzed under Hazelwood. (Docket Entry No. 61, pp. 13-14). The plaintiffs disagree that Hazelwood applies.\n",
      "School-sponsored speech includes \"school-sponsored publications, theatrical productions, and other expressive activities that students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive to bear the imprimatur of the school.\" Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 271, 108 S.Ct. 562. These speech activities are school sponsored because they \"may fairly be characterized as part of the school curriculum, whether or not they occur in a traditional classroom setting, so long as they are supervised by faculty members and designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences.\" Id. School officials may \"exercis[e] editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\" Id. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562. One justification for giving schools this additional authority is to ensure that \"the views of the individual speaker are not erroneously attributed to the school.\" Id. at 271, 108 S.Ct. 562. This is important, among other reasons, so that the school may refuse to sponsor student speech that would \"impinge upon the rights of other students\" or \"associate the school with any position other than neutrality on matters of political controversy.\" Id. at 271-72, 108 S.Ct. 562. According to the Supreme Court, this level of authority was \"consistent with our oft-expressed view that the education of the Nation's youth is primarily the responsibility of parents, teachers, and state and local school officials, and not of federal judges.\" Id. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562. Federal courts should only intervene in decisions to restrict school-sponsored *649 speech when the decision has \"no valid educational purpose.\" Id.\n",
      "The speech at issue in Hazelwood was a high school newspaper published every three weeks by students in the school's Journalism II class. It was funded by the school board, supplemented by advertising sales. The newspaper's faculty adviser submitted page proofs to the school principal before publication. The Hazelwood case arose after the principal censored a story describing the experiences of three pregnant students and another story in the same issue discussing the impact of divorce on students. The pregnancy story did not include the three students' names, but the principal was concerned they might be identifiable regardless. The divorce story included comments from one student identified by namealthough, unknown to the principal, the name was later removedto which the principal felt the student's parents should have been invited to respond on the record. Because the principal was shown the proofs so close to press time, changes could not be made, and the two newspaper pages containing these two stories were withheld from publication entirely. Id. at 262-64, 108 S.Ct. 562. Applying the new standard it crafted, the Supreme Court held that the student newspaper was school-sponsored speech and that the principal acted reasonably in redacting the two pages that concerned him. Id. at 274-76, 108 S.Ct. 562.\n",
      "Hazelwood applies to the intermediate category of school-sponsored expression, when \"students, parents, and members of the public might reasonably perceive [expression] to bear the imprimatur of the school\" and the expression occurs in a curricular activity. The school arranged with Its My Artwork and sent the order form inviting parents to participate to raise funds to purchase school art supplies. The order form stated that the fundraiser was organized by the school, included the names of the school's art teachers, and it instructed parents to make checks out to the school. The holiday cards had no visible tie to the school and were handled solely by the parents (or other similar individuals who ordered the cards using the students' order forms). Viewing the order form entirely separate from the art-card program, it did have the imprimatur of the school. Viewing the order form in the context of the program, the school's connection is far more attenuated.\n",
      "Even if the order form bears the imprimatur of the school, neither the program nor the expression at issuethe text of the holiday cardsoccurred in the context of curricular activities. Courts have disagreed over how broadly to read this aspect of Hazelwood, in part because the facts of that case were much narrower than the language used by the Court in describing its rule. See Brownstein, 42 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. at 763 (stating that courts split between focusing on the language in Hazelwood and the facts of Hazelwood, and suggesting a focus closer to the latter that would require courts to \"distinguish between curricular and non-curricular activities\"). In Bannon v. Sch. Dist. of Palm Beach County, 387 F.3d 1208, 1214-15 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam), the court held that Hazelwood governed a \"school beautification project\" in which students were invited to paint murals on plywood panels that were shielding construction areas on campus. The \"beautification project was designed to impart particular knowledge and skills to student participants and audiences; it allowed student participants to express themselves artistically, allowed student audiences to appreciate their fellow students' artwork, and promoted school spirit, among other things.\" Id. at 1215. It did not change the analysis that students did not earn grades or credit for working on the murals, *650 that they worked on Saturdays instead of during school hours, or that it required a separate participation fee. Id. at 1214-15. By arguing to the contrary, the plaintiffs had ignored \"how broadly the Supreme Court has defined school curricula for Hazelwood's purposes.\" Id. at 1215. Similarly, in Fleming, 298 F.3d at 918, the Tenth Circuit held that Hazelwood applied to a project at Columbine High School in which students were given the opportunity to create artwork on tiles that would be permanently installed in the school's hallways. The court read the language \"designed to impart particular knowledge or skills to student participants and audiences\" in Hazelwood to mean \"activities that affect learning, or in other words, affect pedagogical concerns.\" Id. at 925. That standard was satisfied because the project was intended to \"reacquaint[ ] the students with the school and participat[e] in community healing\" after the tragic shootings at the school. Id. at 931.\n",
      "The Fifth Circuit has suggested that it favors a narrow approach based on the facts of Hazelwood. That court stated, in deciding that Hazelwood did not apply to Texas's textbook selections, that \"the student newspaper [is] an exception to the general rule that schools engage in government speech when they set and implement education policy through the curriculum.\" Chiras, 432 F.3d at 616. Recently, in Morgan v. Swanson, 610 F.3d 877, 884 (5th Cir.2010), the Fifth Circuit decided without further analysis that it did not need to apply Hazelwood in deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion involving a \"winter break\" party at school in which students exchanged small gifts because the facts alleged \"provide[d] no indication that the events at issue were curricular or that the speech was inconsistent with the school's `basic educational mission.'\" Id. (quoting Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 266, 108 S.Ct. 562). The court supported its decision not to apply Hazelwood by noting that \"some of the alleged speech at issue occurred after school hours.\" Id. The Fifth Circuit appears to disagree with the reasoning in Bannon and Fleming, suggesting that the art-card fundraiser should not be analyzed under Hazelwood.\n",
      "Even under the approach used in Bannon and Fleming, it is a stretch to find that the holiday art cards were curricular. As noted, the parents could select their child's art work for the holiday cards, but it is unclear whether the art work was created by the students, under teachers' supervision for the purpose of the holiday cards, or if the parents simply used existing art work. And the inclusion of the art work in a holiday card had no curricular purpose. The cards were sent to the parents, for them to send to whomever they chose. In Bannon and Fleming, it was important that the student work at issue would become a permanent part of the school. The cards at issue here would not appear at school, even briefly. And in Bannon and Fleming, it was important that the expressive activity was the result of a collaborative effort by the school community. The art-card program, by contrast, was done separately by each student's family, away from the school.\n",
      "There is no indication in the record that the art teachers used the holiday card program for any curricular purpose as well as a fundraising purpose. Although some school fundraising projects may also have a curricular purpose, see Planned Parenthood of Southern Nevada, 941 F.2d at 828-29, the fact that a school activity is intended to raise money for school purposes does not necessarily make it curricular as well. See Demmon v. Loudoun Cnty. Pub. Schs., 342 F.Supp.2d 474, 488-90 (E.D.Va.2004) (distinguishing Fleming and holding that a fundraiser allowing parents to purchase bricks commemorating *651 student attendance and participation that would become a permanent walkway on campus was not curricular).\n",
      "Finally, if the art-card fundraiser was eligible for review under Hazelwood, the KISD's actions would be justified unless there was \"no valid educational purpose\" behind blacking out Box F. The restriction must be \"reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns.\" Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 273, 108 S.Ct. 562. Id.[5] Courts have found this final element satisfied if the action is reasonably related to \"the school district's desire to avoid controversy within a school environment.\" Fleming, 298 F.3d at 925-26 (collecting cases). \"Indeed, the pedagogical concern in Hazelwood itself was to avoid the controversial subjects of pregnancy and divorce in a school setting because of the potentially disruptive nature of such subjects upon young students.\" Id. at 926. See, e.g., Curry v. Hensiner, 513 F.3d 570, 578 (6th Cir.2008) (upholding school's decision to prevent a student from selling candy cane ornaments with religious messages as part of a school project; finding that the legitimate pedagogical concerns of preventing other students from being offended and/or subjected to unwanted religious messages that might conflict with their parents' religious teachings motivated the decision); Bannon, 387 F.3d 1208 (finding that the legitimate pedagogical concern of avoiding disruption to the learning environment caused by controversial student-painted murals with overtly religious messages permitted the school to remove the murals); *652 Fleming, 298 F.3d at 933-34 (holding that a high school's desire to avoid a religious debate that would be disruptive to the learning environment was a legitimate pedagogical concern). In this case, the KISD has not raised disruption of the learning environment as a concern. Because the activity at issue is so far removed from the classroom and campus, such a concern would not be present.\n",
      "The Hazelwood analysis does not apply to make validate the choice made by the KISD.\n",
      "\n",
      "C. Was the Viewpoint Discrimination Constitutionally Justified by a Desire to Avoid Violating the Establishment Clause?\n",
      "The KISD argues that even if the speech at issue was not purely government expression or protected under Hazelwood, the interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation is a valid \"defense\" against a First Amendment claim. The parties have stipulated that Box F was blacked out because of its religious \"viewpoint.\"[6] The Supreme Court has held that an interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation can, in some circumstances, justify a government official's restricting private speech on the basis of content. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 269-71, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). In Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 837-46, 115 S.Ct. 2510, the Court dismissed the argument that the University of Virginia's Establishment Clause interest justified the viewpoint-based restrictions the school imposed on a religious student newspaper. \"To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the University to deny eligibility to student publications because of their viewpoint.\" Id. at 845, 115 S.Ct. 2510. In Good News Club, the Supreme Court reserved the question of whether avoiding an Establishment Clause violation would be a sufficient government interest to justify viewpoint discrimination. 533 U.S. at 113, 120, 121 S.Ct. 2093. The Court found it unnecessary to reach that question because it held that the restrictions imposed on which groups could meet on campus were not necessary to avoid violating the Establishment Clause. Id.; see Knight v. Connecticut Dept. of Public Health, 275 F.3d 156, 165 (2d Cir.2001) (distinguishing Good News Club); Child Evangelism Fellowship v. Montgomery Cnty. Public Schs., 373 F.3d 589, 594 (4th Cir.2004) (assuming \"that violation of the Establishment Clause constitutes a governmental interest compelling enough to overcome viewpoint discrimination,\" but not deciding the question because, like the Good News Club Court, it held that the facts before it \"would not be likely to violate the Establishment Clause.\"); Wigg v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist., 382 F.3d 807, 812-13 (8th Cir.2004) (same).\n",

      "The Establishment Clause of the First Amendment states that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\" U.S. CONST. amend. 1. The Clause applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. See Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 42 n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (citing Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15-16, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947)). \"The touchstone for our [Establishment Clause] analysis is the principle that the `First Amendment mandates governmental neutrality between religion and religion, and between religion and nonreligion.'\" McCreary County v.

      "Under the standard set out in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971), a government action will survive an Establishment Clause challenge if: (1) it has a secular purpose; (2) its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion; and (3) it does not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion. Id. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. 2105 (citations omitted). If any of the three elements is absent, the government action violates the Establishment Clause. See Comer v. Scott, 610 F.3d 929, 933-34 (5th Cir.2010). The Fifth Circuit applies the Lemon test in Establishment Clause cases. See, e.g., id. at 933-35; Croft v. Perry, 562 F.3d 735, 742 (5th Cir.2009) (characterizing Lemon as a \"general framework for analyzing Establishment Clause challenges.\").\n",
      "There is no dispute that the KISD would have had a secular purpose had it made all twelve boxes available on the art-card order form. The school's goal was to raise money for the art classes at Pattison Elementary. The issue is the second and third parts of Lemon.\n",
      "\"Lemon's second prong asks whether, irrespective of the School Board's actual purpose, `the practice under review in fact conveys a message of endorsement or disapproval.'\" Freiler v. Tangipahoa Parish Bd. of Educ., 185 F.3d 337, 346 (5th Cir.1999) (quoting Doe v. Santa Fe Independent Sch. Dist., 168 F.3d 806, 817 (5th Cir.1999)). This analysis is similar to the \"endorsement\" test articulated by the Supreme Court. Id. \"Under either the second Lemon prong or the endorsement test, the Supreme Court has cautioned that a government practice may not aid one religion, aid all religions, or favor one religion over another.\" Id. \"Whether the key word is `endorsement,' `favoritism,' or `promotion,' *654 the essential principle remains the same. The Establishment Clause, at the very least, prohibits government from appearing to take a position on questions of religious belief or from `making adherence to a religion relevant in any way to a person's standing in the political community.'\" Allegheny Cnty. v. ACLU, 492 U.S. 573, 593-94, 109 S.Ct. 3086, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989) (quoting Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring)).\n",
      "A long list of cases addresses endorsement and related issues. None is similar to the present case. Both Lynch and Allegheny County involved public, government-sponsored holiday displays. In Lynch, the city of Pawtucket, Rhode Island set up an annual Christmas display in a downtown park owned by a nonprofit organization. The display, all components of which were owned by the city included, a crècheor traditional nativity scene and \"among other things, a Santa Claus house, reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh, candy-striped poles, a Christmas tree, carolers, cutout figures representing such characters as a clown, an elephant, and a teddy bear, hundreds of colored lights, a large banner that reads `SEASONS GREETINGS.'\" Lynch, 465 U.S. at 671, 104 S.Ct. 1355. The Court, applying Lemon, held that this did not violate the Establishment Clause. Id. at 681-83, 104 S.Ct. 1355. Justice O'Connor concurred, writing separately to apply the endorsement test, under which she concluded that the crèche did not \"communicate a message that the government intends to endorse the Christian beliefs represented by the crèche.\" Id. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 1355 (O'Connor, J., concurring). Although the surrounding display did not \"neutralize\" the religious content of the crèche, it provided important context that allowed an observer to understand that the display was not promoting that religious content but rather celebrating a public holiday with \"very strong secular components and traditions.\" Id. Because of the \"ubiquity\" of such holiday displays in society and the history of their use, Pawtucket's display did \"not have the effect of communicating endorsement of Christianity.\" Id. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 1355.\n",
      "The holiday display at issue in Allegheny County was a crèche displayed prominently in the county courthouse, which included an angel holding a banner with the Biblical phrase \"Gloria in Excelsis Deo!\" (Glory to God in the highest). The crèche was surrounded on three sides by a wooden fence, which, for most of the holiday season, was bordered with red and white poinsettia plants. The county also placed a small evergreen tree beside each of the fence's two endpoints. Christmas carolers performed in front of the display during the lunch hour in December. There were no \"figures of Santa Claus or other decorations.\" 492 U.S. at 579-81, 109 S.Ct. 3086. The Court held that the crèche display in the courthouse was an unconstitutional endorsement of religion.[8] Unlike in Lynch, it was not counterbalanced by other, nonreligious elements like Santa Claus and his reindeer. It was the focal point of the display, particularly because it was located in the most prominent part of the building. The surrounding flowers and trees served *655 only to accentuate it. Id. at 598-602, 109 S.Ct. 3086. That there was a sign indicating the crèche was owned by a Catholic group, not the government, did not remove the endorsement effect of the display but instead communicated that the county supported the group as well as the religious message. The Court also rejected the county's argument that the display was acceptable because Christmas is a national holiday with secular aspects. \"The government may acknowledge Christmas as a cultural phenomenon, but under the First Amendment it may not observe it as a Christian holy day by suggesting people praise God for the birth of Jesus.\" Id. at 601, 109 S.Ct. 3086. In responding to the dissent, the Court stated that \"[w]hatever else the Establishment Clause may mean (and we have held it to mean no official preference even for religion over nonreligion...), it certainly means at the very least that government may not demonstrate a preference of one particular sect or creed (including a preference for Christianity over other religions).\" Id. at 605, 109 S.Ct. 3086.\n",
      "The Supreme Court has applied the endorsement analysis and the second Lemon prong in the public school setting. In Widmar, 454 U.S., at 270-77, 102 S.Ct. 269, after holding that the university's interest in complying with the Establishment Clause could justify content discrimination, the Court held that opening campus facilities to religious student groups would not have violated the Establishment Clause. The Court stated that the proper analysis was not whether establishing a forum for religious speech would violate the Establishment Clause, but rather whether creating a forum open to all speech, including religious speech, would have the primary effect of advancing religion. Id. at 273, 102 S.Ct. 269. Although it was possible that an open forum would benefit religious groups by giving them access to school facilities, any such benefits would be \"incidental.\" Id. at 274, 102 S.Ct. 269. This was so because \"an open forum in a public university does not confer any imprimatur of state approval on religious sects or practices,\" just as it does not show approval of the views of various political groups on campus. Id. The school made its facilities available to a broad class of groups and was allowed, consistent with the Establishment Clause, to extend those general benefits to religious groups, just as cities can extend police and fire protection to churches. Id. The Court concluded that, \"[a]t least in the absence of empirical evidence that religious groups will dominate [the university's] open form . . . the advancement of religion would not be the forum's `primary effect'\" Id. at 275, 102 S.Ct. 269.\n",
      "Similarly in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), the Court held that a school district could not \"deny a church access to school premises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious purposes, a film series dealing with family and child-rearing issues faced by parents today.\" Id. at 387, 113 S.Ct. 2141. The district opened school property for after-hours use of \"social, civic, and recreational\" purposes but, as in Widmar, defended its decision to bar the film screenings by invoking a fear of violating the Establishment Clause. Id. at 394-95, 113 S.Ct. 2141. The Court was not persuaded, observing that the screenings would have been after school hours, would not have been sponsored by the school, and would have been open to all members of the public. Under these circumstances, and because a wide range of groups had used the District property in the past, \"there would have been no realistic danger that the community would think that the *656 District was endorsing religion or any particular creed, and any benefit to religion or to the Church would have been no more than incidental.\" Id. at 395, 113 S.Ct. 2141.\n",
      "More recently, in Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 112-19, 121 S.Ct. 2093, the Supreme Court held that an elementary school would not have violated the Establishment Clause by permitting a Christian club for children ages 6 to 12 to hold meetings after school hours in the school cafeteria. The meetings, which students could attend only with parent permission, would have included children reciting and learning Bible verses, signing songs, listening to Bible stories and related lessons, and praying. Id. at 103, 121 S.Ct. 2093. The Court cited favorably to Widmar and Lamb's Chapel, applying them as follows:\n",
      "As in Lamb's Chapel, the Club's meetings were held after school hours, not sponsored by the school, and open to any student who obtained parental consent, not just to Club members. As in Widmar, Milford made its forum available to other organizations. The Club's activities are materially indistinguishable from those in Lamb's Chapel and Widmar. Thus, Milford's reliance on the Establishment Clause is unavailing.\n",
      "Id. at 113, 121 S.Ct. 2093.\n",
      "The Court found no basis for a distinction because the Good News Club involved elementary school children, whom the school argued would be more likely to perceive school endorsement of the group and coercive pressure to join. The Court's opinion gave five reasons for rejecting that argument. First, allowing the club to use school facilities furthered neutrality towards religion by allowing a religious group to speak on the same topics as all other groups. Id. at 114, 121 S.Ct. 2093. Second, to the extent coercion was an appropriate inquiry, the students could not be coerced into attendance because their parents were required to sign permission slips. The Court stated in passing that there was no suggestion that parents would think the school was endorsing religion and that no such argument \"could be reasonably advanced.\" Id. at 115, 121 S.Ct. 2093. Third, after acknowledging that it may have, in the past, given weight to the impressionability of elementary school students, the Court stated that it had \"never extended our Establishment Clause jurisprudence to foreclose private religious conduct during nonschool hours merely because it takes place on school premises where elementary school children may be present.\" Id. The court stated that Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (finding Establishment Clause violation when school included a clergy-led prayer as part of a mandatory graduation ceremony), was not relevant, because the decision in that case did depend not on the fact that the graduation ceremonies were held on school grounds. The Court also rejected the school's argument based on Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 584, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), a case in which it had struck down a Louisiana law requiring that lessons about evolution be accompanied by a lesson on creationism. In Edwards, the Court emphasized the \"children's susceptibility to peer pressure\" as one reason why the state \"exerts great authority and coercive power.\" Id. The Good News Club Court minimized that language because it was it was not part of the meat of the Edwards analysis and because it was mentioned in tandem with mandatory attendance requirements, which were not an issue for the after-school activities in Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 116, 121 S.Ct. 2093. The Court did not read Edwards as suggesting that \"when the school was not actually advancing religion, *657 the impressionability of students would be relevant to the Establishment Clause issue.\" Id. But, even if Edwards did say that, the case was distinguishable because it involved the curriculum taught to students whose attendance was compulsory. Id. at 116-17, 121 S.Ct. 2093.\n",
      "The fourth reason given in Good News Club for rejecting the school's Establishment Clause arguments was that there was no evidence to support a conclusion that the elementary school students would perceive endorsement by the school. There was no evidence that the students were permitted to linger on campus after school ended, that the meetings were held in a room ordinarily used by middle school and high school students, and that, unlike a normal elementary school class, the group ranged in age from 6 to 12. The Court also stated that \"[s]urely even young children are aware of events for which their parents must sign permission forms.\" Id. at 117-18, 121 S.Ct. 2093. Finally, the Court found that, if there was any danger of misperception by children, it was outweighed by the risk that a policy excluding the Good News Club would give those students, older students, and adults in the community the impression that the school was hostile to religion. Id. at 118, 121 S.Ct. 2093. Because there was no \"significance in this case to the possibility that elementary school children may witness the Good News Club's activities on school premises,\" there was no reason to depart from the precedent established in Widmar and Lamb's Chapel and no basis to conclude that allowing the club to meet on school grounds would have violated the Establishment Clause. Id. at 119, 121 S.Ct. 2093.\n",
      "In the present case, Pattison Elementary sent out the art-card order form home and benefitted from the funds raised. The issue is whether that act would have created a perception that the school endorsed the beliefs expressed in one statement on the form. Widmar, Lamb's Chapel, and Good News Club all involved a religious group that the school allowed to meet on school grounds, and the issue was whether that created the perception that the school endorsed the beliefs espoused by that group. In this case, the art-card form was clearly created by a third-party vendor for use by any organization ordering cards. The form invited parents to create the cards and send the cards themselves. The cards were not labeled or inscribed to show any school connection. The fact that the school sent the form home, inviting parents to participate by themselves choosing art work their child had created and choosing one of the preset messages, did not mean that the parents would conclude that the school specifically endorsed all or any of those messages. \"[S]chools do not endorse everything they fail to censor.\" Bd. of Education v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990).\n",
      "To the extent that Lynch and Allegheny County inform this case, they do not support the contention that an unredacted art-card order form would have violated the Establishment Clause. The art-card fundraiser form with Box F included would have provided Christian families the opportunity to purchase cards they could send to others with a quotation from the Bible. The art-card fundraiser form would have also provided messages for Jewish families observing Hanukkah, for Spanish-speaking families observing Christmas, for families observing Kwanzaa, and for families preferring a secular seasonal message. As in Lynch, the fact that the frankly Christian part of the displaythe crèche was surrounded by more secular displays and a \"SEASON'S GREETINGS\" sign meant that it did not convey an endorsement of those Christian beliefs. Lynch, *658 465 U.S. at 671, 104 S.Ct. 1355. The message in Box F was a direct quote from the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 1, verse 21, which stated \"And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus; for He shall save his people from their sins.\" It was qualitatively different from the other messages, which were clearly more secular and cultural in nature. But the presence of Box F as one of twelve message selections would not have communicated to parents that the school accepted or endorsed the specific belief expressed in that message, in addition to, or to the exclusion of, all the other message options provided in the form.\n",
      "Another Fifth Circuit case is also instructive. In Croft, 562 F.3d at 742, the court applied the Lemon test and upheld a Texas statute permitting a minute of silence in public schools against a facial challenge. Id. at 746-51. The statute required each school district to provide for a one-minute period in which each \"student may `as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate, or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student.'\" Id. at 738 (quoting TEX. EDUC.CODE § 25.082(d)). The plaintiffs argued that the primary effect of the statute was to promote mainstream Protestant Christianity, while inhibiting other religions. They also argued that the word \"pray\" in the statute conferred a benefit upon religious people \"because they need not consult a lawyer to know that their children can pray during the moment of silence while non-religious people must consult a lawyer to find out that their children may `not pray' during the same period.\" Id. at 749. The court quickly rejected the latter argument, concluding that it was \"misguided\" because the statute permitted students to \"`engage in any other silent activity.'\" Id. (emphasis original). They also found nothing in the record showing that the statute's primary effect was to advance Protestant Christianity. The statute was \"facially neutral between religious and non-religious activities that students can choose to engage in during the moment of silence,\" and the word \"pray\" did not by itself serve as \"an endorsement of Protestant Christianity.\" Id. Instead, the primary effect was in line with the stated legislative purposes, \"fostering patriotism and mandating a moment of quiet reflection.\" Id. Finally, the court rejected the argument that the statute discriminated against religious sects that prayed by making noises or motions. The court held that this argument was a \"non sequitur\" because \"`[t]he statute simply does not address the problem of accommodating the benefits of those whose prayer must be oral or otherwise self expressive.'\" Id. at 749-50) (quoting May v. Cooperman, 780 F.2d 240, 248 (3d Cir. 1985) (striking down a moment of silence statute because it lacked a secular purpose)). The statute permissibly governed the time, place, and manner of the students' expression by permitting any nondisruptive, silent activity. Id. at 750. Much of the reasoning in Croft was animated by the silent, self-selective nature of the time provided to the students. The court quoted Justice O'Connor's concurrence in Wallace v. Jaffree, a case striking down a moment of silence statute for lack of secular purpose, in which she found it \"difficult to discern a serious threat to religious liberty from a room of silent, thoughtful schoolchildren.\" 472 U.S. at 73, 105 S.Ct. 2479. It also emphasized the students' ability to pray or do some other silent act during that moment of silence.\n",
      "The application of Croft to the present case supports the absence of an Establishment Clause violation. In the present case, the art-card order form provided a menu of message options from which parents could choose, in the privacy of their *659 own homes. One option was explicitly religious and Christian. Although the order form did not provide a blank space in which each family could include a message entirely of its choosing, the fact that the family's choice was limited to one of twelve options does not remove or lessen the significance of the wide range of choices provided.\n",
      "The KISD argues that the leaving Box F in the form and allowing families to choose an explicitly religious message for the art card would not avoid an Establishment Clause violation. This argument responds to the plaintiffs' contention that there would be no Establishment Clause violation because families receiving the order form could have made a private choice about whether to purchase cards bearing the message in Box F. The plaintiffs' argument was in turn based on Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.S. 639, 122 S.Ct. 2460, 153 L.Ed.2d 604 (2002), and similar cases preceding it. Zelman was a school voucher case. The State of Ohio provided funds for families living in Cleveland to attend participating private schools within the city. Each student's family was allowed to choose the school the student attended. Of the participating schools, 82% were religiously affiliated and 96% of the students accepting vouchers attended those religious schools. Id. at 646-47, 122 S.Ct. 2460. The Court held that the program did not have the effect of advancing religion. The Court found no risk that a reasonable observer would think the voucher program was endorsing religion because it was a \"neutral program of private choice, where state aid reaches religious schools solely as a result of the numerous independent decisions of private individuals.\" Id. at 655, 122 S.Ct. 2460. Because of the private choice, there was no \"imprimatur of government endorsement.\" Id. (emphasis removed). The KISD argues that although the art card order form with Box F gave families a menu of choices, there is still an Establishment Clause violation because the form gave families a specific preset list of choices. The Cleveland families in Zelman were given checks directly by the state and allowed to give them to schools of their choice, not one of several options preselected by the government. The KISD's argument is that by even presenting a religious option as one of twelve message choices on the art-card order form, the school would be perceived as endorsing that choice. One problem with this argument is that it is inconsistent with Lynch, in which the inclusion of a religious symbol in a government-sponsored display did not violate the Establishment Clause, and with Croft, in which the inclusion of a religious choice for the moment of silence was not a violation. A second problem with this argument is that the school is simply inviting the parent to make a choice for the parent's own, private expressionthe creation of a holiday cardthat would not occur at the school, have the support of school or government funds, or involve other students or teachers. This is unlike the hypothetical provided by the KISD, in which a public school student bookstore defends its sale of rosary beads or crosses or Stars of David. The hypothetical student bookstore is on the school campus. It is stocked by school funds. The choice of merchandise is clearly a statement by the school and runs afoul of the Establishment Clause for that reason. And the students' purchase occurs at school, often in front of other students and faculty. In the present case, by contrast, the unredacted order form is a school-transmitted form prepared by a third-party vendor for a fundraiser using art work the parents selected and using a message the parents selected. The choice of art work and message was left to the parents to make in their own *660 homes, to create a card that was to be made, received, and sent away from the school. For reasons similar to those explaining why the order form, viewed in the context of the art-card program, was neither pure government speech nor school-sponsored speech, the unredacted form could not fairly have been characterized as a government endorsement of any of the messages, including the Box F message. The unredacted order form would not have communicated the school's endorsement of a particular religious belief.\n",
      "\n",
      "IV. Conclusion\n",
      "Pattison Elementary's effort to avoid a possible Establishment Clause violation led it to remove the only explicitly religious message option that a third-party offered on the holiday card order form the school sent home as a fundraiser. The form was not pure government speech and is therefore subject to First Amendment constraints. The KISD has admitted that its redaction of the one message option was viewpoint discrimination. This discrimination was not justified by an interest in avoiding another constitutional violation, because including that message option would not have violated the Establishment Clause.\n",
      "The plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration is granted. The court's prior grant of summary judgment in favor of the KISD on the as-applied restrictions on student literature distribution remains. The prior grant of summary judgment in favor of the KISD on the exclusion of a religious message from the holiday art cards is vacated. This court concludes that based on the record, the KISD did engage in unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination not justified by the interest in avoiding an Establishment Clause violation.\n",
      "The plaintiffs are ordered to submit an amended final judgment no later than August 20, 2010.\n",

It is not clear whether this service was available when the art card fundraiser was held at Pattison Elementary.\n",
      "[3]  A school may also regulate student speech at school that \"would substantially interfere with the work of the school or impinge upon the rights of other students.\" Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 511-14, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969); Canady v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 240 F.3d 437, 442-43 (5th Cir.2001). The Tinker analysis does not apply here because the expression occurred outside the \"school environment,\" on which Tinker focused, see Tinker, 393 U.S. at 506, 89 S.Ct. 733, and the KISD does not argue that including the Box F message on the order form would have been disruptive.\n",
      "[4]  The appropriateness of viewing the order form in the context of the program it announced is supported by cases dealing with First Amendment issues in public schools. In cases addressing school programs to send flyers prepared by third parties home to parents, the courts analyze whether schools can refuse to allow some flyers to be distributed while allowing others by focusing on the program or event that the flyers announce, not the words of the flyers standing alone or the fact that the school distributes them. See, e.g., Child Evangelism Fellowship of Maryland, Inc. v. Montgomery Cnty. Public Schs., 373 F.3d 589 (4th Cir.2004) (holding that a school district's refusal to allow a flyer notifying parents of about an evangelical religious group holding after-school meetings for an elementary school was unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination); Hills v. Scottsdale Unified Sch. Dist., 329 F.3d 1044 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that sending flyers advertising a Christian summer camp off campus, with a disclaimer clarifying that the school did not endorse the group, would not have violated the Establishment Clause). Although these cases are distinguishable because they involve access to a send-a-flyer-home program at the school, rather than the contents of the flyers, they do show that the mere fact the school sends flyers home does not make the flyer's contents the school's speech.\n",
      "[5]  As noted, the circuits are split on whether Hazelwood permits schools to restrict speech based on its viewpoint. The Fifth Circuit has not taken a position. See Chiras, 432 F.3d at 615 n. 27 (noting the circuit split and stating that \"[b]ecause we conclude that Hazelwood does not apply in this case, we do not consider whether Hazelwood requires viewpoint neutrality.\"). The First and Tenth Circuits do not require viewpoint neutrality to survive a Hazelwood analysis, see Fleming, 298 F.3d at 926-29; Ward v. Hickey, 996 F.2d 448, 452 (1st Cir.1993), but the Second and Eleventh Circuits do, see Peck ex rel. Peck v. Baldwinsville Central Sch. Dist., 426 F.3d 617, 632-33 & n. 9 (2d Cir.2005); Searcey v. Harris, 888 F.2d 1314, 1319 n. 7 (11th Cir.1989). The en banc Ninth Circuit has applied the viewpoint-neutrality-requirement applicable in ordinary forum cases in a Hazelwood analysis, Planned Parenthood of Southern Nevada, 941 F.2d at 829, but a later panel of the court criticized that result, Downs, 228 F.3d at 1010-11. A Third Circuit panel held that viewpoint neutrality is not required because \"a viewpoint-based restriction . . . may be reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns,\" C.H. ex rel. Z.H. v. Oliva, 195 F.3d 167, 172 (3d Cir.1999), but the en banc court vacated that holding, 197 F.3d 63 (3d Cir.1999), and affirmed on other grounds without reaching the viewpoint-neutrality issue, 226 F.3d 198 (3d Cir.2000).\n",
      "\n",
      "In Hazelwood, the Court suggested that it was appropriate for schools to restrict speech based on its viewpoint. The Court stated:\n",
      "A school must also retain the authority to refuse to sponsor student speech that might reasonably be perceived to advocate drug or alcohol use, irresponsible sex, or conduct otherwise inconsistent with the shared values of a civilized social order, or to associate the school with any position other than neutrality on matters of political controversy.\n",
      "Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 272, 108 S.Ct. 562 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The concurring opinion in Bannon recognized that \"[t]his is the epitome of discrimination based on viewpoint.\" Bannon, 387 F.3d at 1218 (Black, J., concurring). As the Tenth Circuit reasoned, Hazelwood's \"specific reasons supporting greater control over school-sponsored speech, such as determining the appropriateness of the message, the sensitivity of the issue, and with which messages a school chooses to associate itself will often turn on viewpoint-based judgments.\" Fleming, 298 F.3d at 928. \"[A] school must `retain the authority' to decide with which positions it will associate itself.\" Id. at 928 n. 8 (quoting Hazelwood, 484 U.S. at 272, 108 S.Ct. 562).\n",
      "[6]  It is arguable that the label \"viewpoint discrimination\" is not properly applied to the facts of this case. The record suggests that eliminating Box F could be viewed as a content-based decision, rather than a viewpoint-based one. But the Supreme Court has recently emphasized the binding effect of factual stipulations, Christian Legal Soc. v. Martinez, ___ U.S. ___, 130 S.Ct. 2971, 2981-83, 177 L.Ed.2d 838 (2010), and the parties have stipulated that the District blacked out Box F \"because of its particular religious viewpoint.\"\n",
      "[7]  Although the Supreme Court has framed the analysis as determining whether an actual Establishment Clause violation would have occurred, one court has held that the test should be less restrictive. In Marchi v. Bd. of Cooperative Educational Services of Albany, 173 F.3d 469, 477 (2d Cir.1999), the Second Circuit looked to whether \"the school authorities could reasonably be concerned that communications of this sort would expose [the school] to non-frivolous Establishment Clause challenges.\" Because the case law provides school officials with \"inadequate guidance as they struggle to comply with constitutional requirements,\" Brownstein, 42 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. at 721, this standard is both practical and realistic in allowing reasonable, considered judgments in the face of competing constitutional obligations.\n",
      "[8]  Allegheny County also involved a second display at a different building, which consisted of a 45-foot Christmas tree, an 18-foot Hanukkah menorah, and a sign celebrating liberty. The court upheld this second display 6-3 in a fractured set of opinions. Justice Blackmun, writing for himself, found it acceptable, as did Justice O'Connor, writing for herself. The four dissenting justices agreed, finding no reason to distinguish between the two displays. Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens all would have struck down both displays.\n",

      "This appeal arises out of a dispute regarding the constitutionality of a provision in the Virginia statute authorizing the issuance of special license plates to members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans1 (SCV). In contrast to other Virginia statutes authorizing special plates for members or supporters of various organizations, this statute contains a restriction (the logo restriction) providing that \"[n]o logo or emblem of any description shall be displayed or incorporated into the design of license plates issued under this section.\" Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.22 (Michie Supp. 2000).2 The SCV are thus prohibited by the logo restriction from receiving special plates bearing the symbol of their organization, which includes the Confederate flag. Richard Holcomb, Commissioner of the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles (the Commissioner), appeals from a district court's order granting summary judgment to the SCV on their claim that the logo restriction violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and granting an injunction to the SCV prohibiting the Commissioner from enforcing the restriction. Because we agree with the district court that the logo restriction violates the Constitution, we affirm.\n",

      "The General Assembly of Virginia has created a program through which \"special\" Virginia license plates may be issued to members and supporters of various organizations or groups. Such plates must be specifically authorized by statute. Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-725 (Michie 1998). Generally, the plates bear the organization's logo and motto in addition to letters and numbers as found on other Virginia license plates. Ordinarily, a group or organization that would like to have a special license plate made available to its members contacts a member of the General Assembly to request that a bill be introduced which, if enacted, would authorize the issuance of a special plate. The General Assembly has authorized well over one hundred special plates in this fashion, a significant number of them for private organizations or associations.\n",

      "The Virginia statute that created the special license plate program gives the Commissioner authority to \"prescribe\" the design of any special plate, stating that \"[a]ll special license plates issued pursuant to this article shall be of designs prescribed by the Commissioner....\" Va. Code Ann. § 46.2-725(B)(3) (Michie 1998). Section 46.2-725(B)(3) does not merely create discretion in the Commissioner to approve or reject plate designs; it also lays out substantive standards for those plate designs, requiring that they \"bear unique letters and numerals, clearly distinguishable from any other license plate designs, and be readily identifiable by law enforcement personnel.\" Id.\n",

The group is invited in a letter from the DMV to submit a design through a designated \"sponsor,\" a person authorized to communicate on the group's behalf with the DMV regarding the plate. The letter instructs the sponsor to include \"electronic media art of the logo and legend for the plate\" with its submission. (J.A. at 104) (DMV form letter to plate sponsors). In addition to these instructions, \"Special License Plate Design Criteria\" are provided, which specifically state that \"[y]ou can use your organization's logo or create a logo to be placed on the plate.\" (J.A. at 106.)\n",

      "The SCV brought this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Virginia by and through their Commander in Chief, Patrick J. Griffin, seeking a declaration that the logo restriction is invalid under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, an injunction requiring the Commissioner to issue special license plates bearing the logo of the SCV, including the Confederate flag, to those members of the SCV who request them, and attorney's fees and costs pursuant to 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988. The SCV and the Commissioner filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court granted the SCV's motion and denied the Commissioner's motion on January 18, 2001. Concluding that the logo restriction violated the First Amendment as incorporated into the Fourteenth, the district court declared it invalid on that ground. Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Holcomb, 129 F.Supp.2d 941, 947 (W.D.Va.2001). The district court then entered an injunction enjoining the Commissioner from enforcing the logo restriction and requiring the issuance of the special plates with the design sought by the SCV. The district court did not rule on the issues of costs or attorney's fees, stating that those matters would be taken up at a later date. Id. at 949.\n",

      "In support of its rulings, the district court made several findings. First, it found that plates authorized for private organizations under Virginia's special license plate program constitute private, rather than government, speech. Id. at 945 (\"the design of [special plates] honoring private entities is the speech of those entities\"). The district court then analyzed the effect of the logo restriction on the SCV's speech rights, concluding that the prohibition of any logo or emblem on the SCV's special plate discriminates on the basis of viewpoint and is thus invalid. Id. at 947. The district court also conducted an analysis of the special license plate program as a forum for speech, concluding that it would constitute a \"designated public forum\" under such analysis.3 Id. at 947-49. The district court found that strict scrutiny would be applied to restrictions in that forum, other than reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, and that the logo prohibition could not survive such scrutiny.\n",

      "As to the appropriate remedy for the violation, the district court found that the two sentences of section 46.2-746.22 are severable under Virginia law, and that the second, comprising the logo restriction, could thus be invalidated while leaving the first intact. Id. at 949. The district court found alternatively that even if the second sentence could not be severed from the first (and consequently the whole statute authorizing a special plate for the SCV would have to be invalidated), it would act pursuant to its inherent equitable powers to compel the Commissioner to comply with the requirements of the first sentence of § 46.2-746.22 — that is, to issue special plates to the SCV containing their logo. To invalidate the authorizing statute entirely, the district court found, would give effect to viewpoint discrimination in violation of the First Amendment. Id. The Commissioner timely noted this appeal.\n",

      "The Commissioner's argument on appeal has three parts. First, the Commissioner contends that the special plate authorized for the SCV, and indeed all the special plates authorized in Virginia, are instances of \"government speech.\" Second, the Commissioner argues that even if the special plates contain private speech, that speech has not been abridged impermissibly in violation of the First Amendment because the logo restriction is a reasonable subject matter limitation, rather than a bar to expression of a particular viewpoint. Third and finally, the Commissioner contends that if section 46.2-746.22 is unconstitutional, the district court erred when it severed what it found to be the offending portion of the authorizing statute, thereby creating a statute that the General Assembly did not pass and would not have passed.\n",

In reviewing the record, we \"draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving party, ... and we may not make credibility determinations or weigh the evidence.\" Edell & Assoc., P.C. v. Law Offices of Peter G. Angelos, 264 F.3d 424, 435-36 (4th Cir.2001). Where the Government imposes viewpoint-based restrictions, we evaluate the restrictions pursuant to strict scrutiny.

Reno, 47 F.3d 642, 648 (4th Cir.1995). \"To pass this test a law must be necessary to serve compelling governmental interests by the least restrictive means available.\" Id. (citing R.A.V. v.

      "With these background principles in mind, we turn first to the question of whether the speech on the special plates authorized by the Virginia legislature is private speech or \"government speech.\" The Commissioner contends that any expressive content on a Virginia special plate is a \"statement\" by the Commonwealth about the group represented on the plate. In this vein, the Commissioner emphasizes that the General Assembly authorized the SCV's special plate to \"honor\" that organization. Because these special plates constitute government speech, the Commissioner argues, traditional First Amendment inquiries do not apply, in light of the settled principle that when the government speaks, it may craft its message and cannot be forced to formulate or subsidize a message it does not choose. Accordingly, he argues that because the SCV's special plates constitute government speech, they are not subject to First Amendment challenge on the grounds raised by the SCV.\n",

      "It is well established that \"the government can speak for itself.\" Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229, 120 S.Ct. 1346, 146 L.Ed.2d 193 (2000). Pursuant to its many and varied functions, \"[t]he government is entitled `to promote particular messages' ..., and to take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its messages are neither garbled nor distorted\" — that is, the government may limit the scope of the message it sends. Griffin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 274 F.3d 818, 822 (4th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted). The government may promote its policies and positions either through its own officials or through its agents. This authority to \"speak\" necessarily carries with it the authority to select from among various viewpoints those that the government will express as its own. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991) (noting government's authority to select and fund speech in a non-neutral way in order to send its own message).\n",

      "In Rust, the Supreme Court held that the federal government constitutionally could prohibit doctors from providing counseling or other information regarding abortion to patients while treating those patients in a program set up and funded by the federal government. The doctors' right to speak was not offended by the limitation imposed by the federal government because the government had merely chosen to fund one activity — counseling not including discussion of abortion — to the exclusion of another — counseling including discussion of abortion. See id. at 198-99, 111 S.Ct. 1759. Although Rust is considered to have been one of the first cases recognizing the government speech doctrine, see Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 541, 121 S.Ct. 1043, 149 L.Ed.2d 63 (2001), nowhere in Rust did the Court rely explicitly on the government speech rationale.5 Rather, the Court simply stated that government is free to fund chosen activities to the exclusion of others. Id.; see also Griffin v. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 274 F.3d 818, 822 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that the government as speaker \"is entitled to promote particular messages\"). In later cases, however, the Court consistently has interpreted Rust as indicating that the doctors' funded counseling activities were government speech, and that where the government is the speaker, it may choose and tailor its message. Velazquez, 531 U.S. at 541, 121 S.Ct. 1043 (stating that while \"[t]he Court in Rust did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the counseling activities of the doctors ... amounted to governmental speech[,] when interpreting the holding in later cases, ... we have explained Rust on this understanding\").\n",

      "Thus, even ordinarily impermissible viewpoint-based distinctions drawn by the government may be sustained where the government itself speaks or where it uses private speakers to transmit its message.6 Id.

Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833, 115 S.Ct. 2510, 132 L.Ed.2d 700 (1995), for the proposition that such distinctions may be sustained in \"instances, like Rust, in which the government `used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.'\").

      "No clear standard has yet been enunciated in our circuit or by the Supreme Court for determining when the government is \"speaking\" and thus able to draw viewpoint-based distinctions, and when it is regulating private speech and thus unable to do so. Indeed, as we have noted, there exists some controversy over the scope of the government speech doctrine. Several other circuits, however, have addressed the question in contexts that are instructive here. Our sister circuits have examined (1) the central \"purpose\" of the program in which the speech in question occurs; (2) the degree of \"editorial control\" exercised by the government or private entities over the content of the speech; (3) the identity of the \"literal speaker\"; and (4) whether the government or the private entity bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" for the content of the speech, in analyzing circumstances where both government and a private entity are claimed to be speaking. See Wells v. City and County of Denver, 257 F.3d 1132, 1141 (10th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 469, 151 L.Ed.2d 384 (2001) (analyzing these four factors in considering whether a sign listing the private sponsors of a public holiday display constituted government speech); Knights of the Ku Klux Klan v.

We find the recent approaches of our sister circuits instructive here. Although we do not conclude that the factors relied on in Knights of the KKK, Downs, and Wells constitute an exhaustive or always-applicable list, we believe that examination of those factors in this context, in conjunction with consideration of applicable Supreme Court precedent, resolves the government speech issue before us.7\n",

      "Turning to application of the factors enumerated by our sister circuits to the case before us, we first consider the \"purpose\" of the special plate program. While the purpose of a government program or subsidy that implicates speech interests will in some cases be apparent, see Wells, 257 F.3d at 1141 (citing evidence that the purpose of the sign asserted to be government speech was \"to thank the sponsors and the citizens for the support of the cost of the display\"), this will not always be the case. Here, for instance, the Commissioner takes the position that the purpose of the special plate program is to serve as a vehicle for the expression of government messages honoring those groups for which it authorizes special plates. The SCV, on the other hand, contend that the purpose of the program is to allow individuals to display their association with and express their pride in the messages or goals of the group for which a special plate is authorized.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "Examining the special plate program as a whole, we believe neither party is entirely correct in its argument about the purposes of the program. Several considerations lead us to conclude that the purpose of the special plate program primarily is to produce revenue while allowing, on special plates authorized for private organizations, for the private expression of various views. First, the fees collected through the special plate program are, as the Commissioner concedes, \"a source of additional revenue\" for Virginia. (Br. of Appellant at 50.) Indeed, in fiscal year 2000, the net revenue from special plates totaled nearly $4.5 million. The Commissioner himself cites this revenue as a purpose of the program. While the mere fact that the program produces revenue for Virginia is not conclusive as to its purpose, the net financial impact of the program on the Commonwealth's fisc does indicate that the General Assembly here is not making the kind of selective funding decisions involved in cases like Rust and Finley.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "Second, the legislation creating the special plate program imposes a fee structure that suggests the program's revenue-producing aim. Section 46.2-725 of the Virginia Code, which authorizes special plates, states that\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "[n]o license plates provided for in this article shall be issued until the Commissioner receives at least 350 prepaid applications therefor. In the event that 350 or more prepaid applications have not been received on or before the last day of the third year from the date the license plates were last authorized, no such license plates shall be issued unless the license plates are reauthorized by the General Assembly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-725(B)(1). The supposed \"honor\" bestowed on a group for whom a special license plate is authorized, in other words, is conditioned on the willingness of 350 private persons to pay extra to obtain the plate expressing the \"honor.\" If the General Assembly intends to speak, it is curious that it requires the guaranteed collection of a designated amount of money from private persons before its \"speech\" is triggered.8 It is not the case, in other words, that the special plate program only incidentally produces revenue for the Commonwealth. The very structure of the program ensures that only special plate messages popular enough among private individuals to produce a certain amount of revenue will be expressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "Third, the special plate authorized for the SCV is available only to members of the SCV who can provide \"written evidence\" that they are members of the group. Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.22. This type of restriction is common among the statutes authorizing special plates in Virginia. E.g., Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-738.1 (Michie 1998) (requiring written evidence that the applicant is a member of the American Radio Relay League for issuance of the special plate recognizing that group); § 46.2-741 (Michie 1998) (requiring the same for survivors of the attack on Pearl Harbor); § 46.2-747.1 (Michie 1998) (requiring the same for members of the Gold Wing Road Riders Association). These restrictions suggest that the special plates to which they apply are intended by the General Assembly to allow the authorized recipients to express their pride in membership in an organization while facilitating the group's speech. If non-members cannot obtain the plates, those motorists who have them send a personal message by carrying the plates on their vehicles, because the plates identify them as members of the organization. Cf. Lewis v. Wilson, 253 F.3d 1077, 1079 (8th Cir.2001) (concluding that the purpose of any forum created by a vanity license plate program allowing individuals to select the combinations of numbers and letters appearing on their plates was \"to give vent to the personality, and reveal the character or views of the plate's holder\"), cert. denied, Fischer v. Lewis, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1536, 152 L.Ed.2d 464 (2002).\n",

      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "Turning to the \"editorial control\" exercised by the Commonwealth over the content of special plates in Virginia, the record reveals that little, if any, control ordinarily is exercised. The Commissioner argues that his statutory discretion to approve or reject a given plate design demonstrates that the Commonwealth maintains control at all times over the content of the special plates in question. See, e.g., Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-725(B)(3) (Michie 1998) (stating that \"[a]ll special license plates issued pursuant to this article shall be of designs prescribed by the Commissioner ....\"). The Commissioner, however, has identified only one occasion on which this discretion was exercised, an instance in which the Commissioner rejected a plate design with the slogan \"Union Yes.\" (Br. of Appellant at 45.) The rejection was not challenged. Moreover, the information provided by the Commissioner, acting through a representative at the DMV, to sponsors of special plates suggests that it is they, not the Commissioner, who make the substantive decisions regarding special plate content. The form letter to special plate sponsors, for instance, states that the sponsor is to \"provide DMV with electronic media art of the logo and legend for the plate.\" (J.A. at 104.) Similarly, the \"Special Plate Design Criteria\" sent to plate sponsors contains detailed instructions for ensuring that the design submitted by the sponsor will conform to size and space requirements, but it does not contain guidelines regarding the substantive content of the plates or any indication of reasons, other than failure to comply with size and space restrictions, that a special plate design might be rejected. Cf. Wells, 257 F.3d at 1142 (finding government speech in part because there was \"no indication that any of the [private speakers] ... even knew about the... sign, much less exercised any editorial control over its design or content\"). Nor does the General Assembly ordinarily assert \"editorial control\" over the content of these special plates. Indeed, the Commissioner conceded at oral argument that the legislation authorizing the SCV's special plate is the only legislation that the General Assembly has passed containing a restriction on the design of the plate.\n",

      "We next inquire into who is the \"literal speaker\" and who bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" for the speech in this case. The \"literal\" speaker here might be said to be the license plate itself, which would seem not to suggest either government or private speech strongly, and who bears \"ultimate responsibility\" for the speech is unclear. We note that the court in Wells reasoned that ownership of the means of communication was a valid consideration in determining whether it contained government speech, and the parties do not dispute here that Virginia continues to own the special plates at all times. Importantly, though, the special plates are mounted on vehicles owned by private persons, and the Supreme Court has indicated that license plates, even when owned by the government, implicate private speech interests because of the connection of any message on the plate to the driver or owner of the vehicle. See Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (holding that New Hampshire violated the First Amendment rights of objecting drivers when it required them to display the state motto \"Live Free or Die\" on their license plates). Accordingly, these factors, like the others we have discussed, lead us to conclude that the SCV's special plates constitute private speech.9\n",

      "Because the speech on the authorized special plate is the SCV's rather than Virginia's, the SCV's First Amendment rights are implicated by the logo restriction in the authorizing legislation, and we must consider the impact of that restriction on their rights. The SCV contend, and the district court found, that the logo restriction discriminates on the basis of the viewpoint they would like to express, through the logo incorporating the Confederate flag, on their special plate. Where the government is not expressing its own policy, either directly or, as in Rust, through an intermediary, it presumptively violates the First Amendment when it discriminates on the basis of views expressed by private speakers. See Ark. Educ. Television Comm'n v. Forbes, 523 U.S. 666, 677, 118 S.Ct. 1633, 140 L.Ed.2d 875 (1998); Cornelius v.

As the Supreme Court has stated, \"[i]t is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on ... the message it conveys.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 828, 115 S.Ct. 2510. Such viewpoint discrimination presumptively is impermissible whether it occurs within or outside a private speech forum. Forbes, 523 U.S. at 676, 118 S.Ct. 1633 (stating that viewpoint discrimination is impermissible even where no forum is created at all); Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 828, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (stating that viewpoint discrimination is presumed impermissible in any forum under forum analysis); Multimedia Pub. v.

      "The Supreme Court has adopted forum analysis as the means of analyzing restrictions placed on private speech that occurs on government property or with government participation (financial or otherwise) where the government is not expressing its own message.10 See, e.g., Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829-30, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (applying forum analysis where government funds private speech, even in a \"metaphysical\" forum); Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 121 S.Ct. 2093, 2100, 150 L.Ed.2d 151 (2001) (applying forum analysis where speech occurs on government property); Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free Sch.

The district court, applying forum analysis principles, concluded that the special plate program constituted a designated or limited public forum. The Commissioner challenges this conclusion, arguing that the special plate program is a nonpublic forum. The type of forum that exists here, however, is relevant only if the logo restriction is viewpoint-neutral. As we discuss below, we conclude that the logo restriction is not viewpoint-neutral, rendering the restriction presumptively unconstitutional in any forum. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829-30, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (stating that viewpoint discrimination is presumptively impermissible in all fora for private speech). Thus, we need not resolve the parties' dispute over the type of forum created by the special plate program. Instead, we next explain why the Commissioner's argument that the logo restriction is viewpoint-neutral must fail.\n",

      "In examining the Commissioner's argument that the logo restriction is viewpoint-neutral, we begin with the language of the restriction. The logo restriction directs that \"[n]o logo or emblem of any description shall be displayed or incorporated into the design of the [SCV] license plates issued under this section.\" Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.22. Although the logo restriction itself makes no reference to the Confederate flag, the Commissioner concedes that it was the inclusion of the Confederate flag in the SCV's logo that led to the prohibition against the use of the logo on the SCV's special license plate. (Br. of Appellant at 10 (conceding that the purpose of the logo restriction is to \"ensure that the battle flag does not appear on the special license plate\").) Having conceded that the logo restriction is an attempt to ban the display of the Confederate flag, the Commissioner argues that the restriction is content-based, but viewpoint-neutral, because it bans all viewpoints about the Confederate flag (which the Commissioner identifies as a category of \"content\" or subject matter) from the special plate forum.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "28\n",
      "As the Supreme Court has noted, the distinction between content and viewpoint discrimination \"is not a precise one.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 831, 115 S.Ct. 2510. Viewpoint discrimination is a kind of content discrimination, but is not always easily distinguishable.11 Cf. id. at 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (\"When the government targets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious form of content discrimination.\"). Analysis of the basic First Amendment principles that \"provide the framework forbidding the state to exercise viewpoint discrimination,\" however, directs us to the considerations that indicate such viewpoint-based discrimination here. Id. at 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (reviewing First Amendment cases stating basic principles following from the precept that government may not regulate speech based on its viewpoint or the message it conveys). For instance, \"[i]n the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation may not favor one speaker over another.\" Id. at 828, 115 S.Ct. 2510. Similarly, \"[t]he government must abstain from regulating speech when the motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the restriction.\" Id. (citing Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983)). Thus, where an evaluation of a given restriction and the surrounding circumstances indicates that one or more speakers are favored over others, and further that the basis for the restriction is in fact the message the disfavored speaker seeks to convey, the restriction violates the First Amendment. Moreover, where restrictions or regulations of speech discriminate on the basis of the content of speech, there is an \"inherent risk that the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate through coercion rather than persuasion ...\" — in other words, to exercise viewpoint discrimination. Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 512 U.S. 622, 642-43, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). Because the logo restriction, admittedly aimed at prohibiting the display of the Confederate flag, involves an inherent danger of viewpoint discrimination, a close review of the context in which the restriction is imposed, as well as the effect of the restriction itself, is appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "29\n",
      "In analyzing the logo restriction's effect, we note first that the SCV's organizational logo, incorporating the Confederate flag, certainly represents a viewpoint. As the Commissioner concedes, the logo would \"advance [the] view that the flag [is] a symbolic acknowledgment of pride in Southern heritage and ideals of independence.\"12 (Br. of Appellant at 40 (quotation and citation omitted)); see also American Legion Post 7 of Durham, N.C. v. Durham, 239 F.3d 601, 606 (4th Cir.2001) (noting that \"[f]lags, especially flags of a political sort, enjoy an honored position in the First Amendment hierarchy\" because they are \"close[] to the core of political expression protected by the First Amendment\"). The logo restriction does not restrict the Confederate flag as such, but rather the Confederate flag as used in the SCV's logo. Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.22 (\"no logo or emblem of any description shall be displayed or incorporated into the design of\" SCV's special plates). Rather than prohibiting the Confederate flag as subject matter, then, the logo restriction by its terms prohibits the SCV's use of the Confederate flag. In other words, the logo restriction not only prohibits speech on the basis of its content, as the Commissioner concedes, but also, by its terms, burdens the speech of only a single speaker in the forum. Cf. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 227-29, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987) (holding, where a sales tax was theoretically imposed on all magazines, but exemptions from the tax were created for all but a few, that the tax scheme \"treat[ed] some magazines less favorably than others,\" and that the discriminatory impact of the tax on the few magazines subject to it \"burden[ed] rights protected by the First Amendment\"); cf. also Giebel v. Sylvester, 244 F.3d 1182, 1188 (9th Cir. 2001) (concluding that the actions of a professor at a state university in tearing down handbills posted on university bulletin boards publicizing a former colleague's appearance at an upcoming conference were viewpoint-discriminatory because the professor \"sought to silence speech by a particular speaker\"). This fact alone suggests that the SCV's viewpoint, rather than the Confederate flag as \"content,\" is the subject of the restriction, and thus that the SCV's speech is discriminated against because of the views it would express.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30\n",
      "To examine the context in which the logo restriction is imposed, we first define the scope of the forum in which the SCV wish to speak, as definition of the forum's scope provides a backdrop for analysis of the \"viewpoint or content\" question. Cf. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 830-31, 115 S.Ct. 2510 (determining that \"the subjects discussed [by the prohibited speech] were ... within the approved category of publications\" aside from their prohibited perspective by reference to other speech permitted in the forum); Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S. at 393, 113 S.Ct. 2141 (examining a restriction on religious uses of school facilities for viewpoint discrimination by reference to other speech permitted within the forum). This inquiry is distinct from the question of which type of forum exists. See Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 797, 800-01, 105 S.Ct. 3439 (noting that proper definition of the scope of the relevant forum is necessary to analyze constitutionality of a restriction); Air Line Pilots Ass'n, Int'l v. Dept. of Aviation of Chicago, 45 F.3d 1144, 1151 (7th Cir.1995) (stating that identification of forum must be undertaken before analysis of a restriction imposed on speech in that forum).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "31\n",
      "The relevant forum is defined by focusing on \"the access sought by the speaker.\" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 801, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Here, the relevant forum is Virginia's special plate program, consisting of the special plates authorized and produced under the general rules established by Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-725. It is to the special plate program that the SCV seek \"access\" (here, access without restrictions on their speech within the forum), and special plates authorized for other groups and organizations thus provide the relevant context for analyzing the restriction imposed on the SCV. Cf. Air Line Pilots, 45 F.3d at 1151-52 (determining, where an airline pilots' association sought to display a diorama in display case at O'Hare airport, that the airport's display cases, rather than the airport itself, constituted the relevant forum, because it was to a display case that association sought access); Texas v. Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, 58 F.3d 1075, 1078 (5th Cir.1995) (defining the forum in question, where the Ku Klux Klan sought to participate in an Adopt-A-Highway Program, as the program as a whole rather than the State's highways or the particular sign to which participation would entitle the Klan).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "32\n",
      "That the Confederate flag as content is prohibited in this forum, as the Commissioner contends, is not borne out by the statute at issue, the record before us, or any rules or restrictions generally applicable to Virginia's special plate program. No general restrictions, save those relating to space and legibility of identifying information, are imposed on all special plates. The logo restriction is the only restriction of its kind contained in any of the numerous special-plate-authorizing statutes. A review of these numerous and varied statutes does not reveal any intent on the Commonwealth's part to limit, on the basis of content, the scope of speech within the special plate forum in any principled way. Further, the \"content\" of the excluded speech is similar, if not identical, to content allowed on plates authorized under the special plate program for those with other viewpoints. For example, many of the groups and organizations for which special plates have been approved without restrictions are groups that have distinct viewpoints in political or social debate. See, e.g., Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.10 (approving special plate for AFL-CIO supporters without restriction); § 46.2-749.6 (approving special plate for supporters of the National Rifle Association without restriction).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "The nature of the restricted speech, the lack of a generally applicable content-based restriction,13 the breadth of the special plate program in Virginia, and the lack of any restrictions in statutes authorizing special plates other than the SCV's belie the Commissioner's argument that the restriction in question is merely a content-based restriction. Rather, the logo restriction works viewpoint discrimination against the SCV. Such discrimination, as we have noted, is \"presumed to be unconstitutional.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 828, 115 S.Ct. 2510. The Commissioner has not rebutted — indeed, has not contended that he could rebut — the presumption of unconstitutionality following from viewpoint discrimination against private speech by demonstrating that the viewpoint discrimination is \"the least restrictive means available\" to serve a \"compelling governmental interest[].\" American Life League, Inc. v. Reno, 47 F.3d 642, 648 (4th Cir. 1995). Thus, the logo restriction cannot withstand strict scrutiny review.\n",

      "Based upon our review of the government speech and forum principles enunciated by the Supreme Court, and application of those principles to the case at hand, we conclude that the logo restriction in Va.Code Ann. § 46.2-746.22 is an instance of viewpoint discrimination that does not survive strict scrutiny review and accordingly is impermissible.14 The restriction, then, cannot stand. The proper remedy for this violation of the First Amendment's strictures, however, remains to be determined, and it is to that issue that we now turn.\n",

      "Because we agree with the district court that the logo restriction is unconstitutional, we must determine whether the district court properly severed the statute. The Commissioner argues that severing the statute was an improper incursion into the realm of legislative discretion. Moreover, if the statute was not severable, the Commissioner claims, there was no legal basis for the district court's asserted exercise of its \"equitable power\" and hence that portion of the district court's ruling that compels the Commissioner's compliance with the non-restrictive portion of section 46.2-746.22 must likewise be invalidated. The question of the severability of a state statute's provisions is governed by state law. See Department of Treasury v. Fabe, 508 U.S. 491, 509-10, 113 S.Ct. 2202, 124 L.Ed.2d 449 (1993) (state law governs severability of a state statute); Environmental Technology Council v.

Under this rule, \"in the absence of a severability clause, the test of severability is whether the legislature would be satisfied with what remains [of the statute] after the invalid part has been eliminated,\" an inquiry that makes the intent of the law-makers controlling.

Holcomb, 129 F.Supp.2d 941, 949 (W.D.Va.2001). The SCV appear to concede that the intent of the legislature is the proper standard for determining severability.

[the] provisions must operate in accord with one another.\" Va.Code Ann. § 1-17.1. We see no reason why the second sentence of § 46.2-746.22 must operate in accord with the first, and the Commissioner has not suggested any such reason in his brief. The first sentence is not rendered meaningless or nonsensical by the elimination of the second. Indeed, the operation of the first sentence is in a sense not affected at all by the elimination of the second — it continues to authorize special plates for the SCV, as it did before the second sentence was determined to be unconstitutional. The only change in the statute's operation is the excision of the unconstitutional logo restriction, a restriction that was imposed entirely by the second sentence. Cf.

      "Even assuming, as the parties apparently do, that the \"intent of the legislature\" inquiry remains a valid consideration in determining severability under Virginia law, we find that it is overcome here by the presumption of severability which applies to statutes enacted by the General Assembly. The logo restriction may well have been the result of a political compromise within the legislature that aided the passage of section 46.2-746.22. Some legislators may have agreed to support the authorizing statute only on condition of the addition of the logo restriction. Under the current legal framework in Virginia, however, the General Assembly enacts laws against the backdrop of section 1-17.1's severability presumption. Without a clear indication that the legislature's intent was to enact section 46.2-746.22 only with the logo restriction in place, and without any expression of the statute's purpose, we cannot presume that the legislature would not be \"satisfied\" with what remains after the second sentence is severed.

Thus, viewpoint-based restrictions of private speech are presumptively unconstitutional. Id. at 382, 112 S.Ct. 2538. We are mindful that the Supreme Court has not hewn unfailingly to the structured approach of strict scrutiny review when evaluating viewpoint-based restrictions under forum analysis, discussed infra, Part IV.B.

There also is uncertainty regarding the government's role as speaker, in certain limited circumstances, when it selects from among private speakers those whose messages it will favor or subsidize. When it does so, at least in the contexts of excellence-based funding decisions and the exercise of \"editorial\" discretion in a forum necessarily restricted by the medium of communication, the government's actions may be subject to somewhat less restrictive First Amendment limitations than would otherwise apply. See Nat'l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 585, 118 S.Ct. 2168, 141 L.Ed.2d 500 (1998) (noting that government, in setting criteria to be considered in arts funding decisions, could constitutionally differentiate between applicants based on, inter alia, respect for \"general standards of decency\" because such considerations are \"a consequence of the nature of arts funding,\" which, because of its inherently subjective excellence-based character, makes \"absolute neutrality ... simply `inconceivable'\") (internal citation omitted); Ark.

Rust, 500 U.S. at 193, 111 S.Ct. 1759 (holding that the government may subsidize a program to express selected views). This contention is unpersuasive, however, in light of the revenue produced by special plates and section 46.2-725's fee structure. To obtain a special plate, the government requires a vehicle owner to pay a fee in excess of that required to obtain an ordinary Virginia license plate. It would be incongruous to term the government's providing the option of obtaining these plates, for an extra fee, a subsidy like that provided in Rust.\n",

The other forum types, the designated public forum and the nonpublic forum, are created when the government grants access to property or resources to private speakers. Id. at 679, 118 S.Ct. 1633 (holding that the government creates a speech forum when it makes access to government property or funding available to a \"certain class of speakers\"). A designated public forum, whether limited or unlimited in scope, is one a state creates \"by intentionally opening a non-traditional forum for public discourse.\" Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802, 105 S.Ct. 3439. Further, the government may \"confin[e] a [limited] forum to the limited and legitimate purposes for which it was created ... [by] reserving it for certain groups or for the discussion of certain topics.\" Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829, 115 S.Ct. 2510. In a nonpublic forum, the government \"reserve[s] eligibility for access to the forum to a particular class of speakers, whose members must then, as individuals, `obtain permission' ... to use it.\" Forbes, 523 U.S. at 679, 118 S.Ct. 1633. While the limitations on the government's ability to regulate speech in these fora depends in part on the type of forum at issue, viewpoint discrimination is presumptively impermissible in all fora for private speech. Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 829-30, 115 S.Ct. 2510.\n",

      " As the Ninth Circuit has noted, the \"coherence of the distinction between `content discrimination' and `viewpoint discrimination'\" may be seen as \"tenuous.\"Giebel v. Sylvester, 244 F.3d 1182, 1188 n. 10 (9th Cir.2001). \"While the former describes the subject matter of the speech, and the latter the specific positions taken on the matter, the level at which `subject matter' is defined can control whether discrimination is held to be on the basis of content or viewpoint.\" Id. Nevertheless, it is clear from the Supreme Court's decisions that, given a properly defined subject matter, the government is presumptively unable to discriminate among viewpoints about that subject matter.\n",

McDonald, 280 F.3d 159, 169-70 (2d Cir. 2001) (upholding the application of a vanity license plate regulation banning plates conveying messages \"offensive or confusing to the general public\" to rescind license plates bearing the letters \"SHTHPNS\" because the regulation was a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral restriction on speech in a nonpublic forum); Lewis v. Wilson, 253 F.3d 1077, 1080-81 (8th Cir.2001) (finding unconstitutional a regulation banning vanity plates bearing messages \"contrary to public policy\" because the regulation gave unbridled discretion to the state official charged with enforcing it), cert. denied, Fischer v. Lewis, ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1536, 152 L.Ed.2d 464 (2002).

Further, the Commissioner has not advanced the argument that display of the Confederate flag on a private vehicle is equivalent to \"fighting words,\" the use of which the Commonwealth constitutionally may prohibit, and we do not address any issues that might be raised by such an argumentSee Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942) (characterizing as \"fighting words\" speech that \"itself inflicts injury or tends to incite immediate violence\").\n",

      "Respondents (an organization licensed by petitioner city to present certain musical concerts, and a promoter of the concerts) brought suit in Federal District Court against the city and city officials.  Alleging, inter alia, that the city's cancellation of the license amounted to a violation of their constitutional rights under color of state law, respondents sought compensatory and punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Without objection, the court gave an instruction authorizing the jury to award punitive damages against each defendant, including the city.  Verdicts were returned for respondents, which in addition to awarding compensatory damages also awarded punitive damages against both the individual officials and the city.  The city moved for a new trial, arguing for the first time that punitive damages could not be awarded against a municipality under § 1983.  Although noting that the challenge to the instruction was untimely under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 51, the District Court considered and rejected the city's substantive legal arguments on their merits. The Court of Appeals affirmed, finding that the city's failure to object to the charge at trial, as required by Rule 51, could not be overlooked on the theory that the charge itself was plain error.  The court also expressed a belief that the challenged instruction might not have been error at all, and identified the \"distinct possibility\" that municipalities could be liable for punitive damages under § 1983 in the proper circumstances.\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "1. The city's failure to object to the charge at trial does not foreclose this Court from reviewing the punitive damages issue.  Because the District Court adjudicated the merits, and the Court of Appeals did not disagree with that adjudication, no interests in fair and effective trial administration advanced by Rule 51 would be served if this Court refused to reach the merits. Nor should review here be limited to the restrictive \"plain error\" standard.  The contours of municipal liability under §1983 are currently in a state of evolving definition and uncertainty, and the very novelty of the legal issue at stake counsels unconstricted review.  In addition to being novel, the punitive damages question is also important and appears likely to recur in § 1983 litigation against municipalities.  Pp. 255-257.\n",
      "2. A municipality is immune from punitive damages under § 1983.  Pp. 258-271.\n",
      "(a) In order to conclude that Congress meant to incorporate a particular immunity as an affirmative defense in § 1983 litigation, a court must undertake careful inquiry into considerations of both history and public policy.  Pp. 258-259.\n",
      "(b) In 1871, when Congress enacted what is now § 1983, it was generally understood that a municipality was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity, but this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive damages at common law.  Indeed, common-law courts consistently and expressly declined to award punitive damages against municipalities.  Nothing in the legislative history suggests that, in enacting § 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress intended to abolish the doctrine of municipal immunity from punitive damages.  If anything, the relevant history suggests the opposite.  Pp. 259-266.\n",
      "(c) Considerations of public policy do not support exposing a municipality to punitive damages for the malicious or reckless conduct of its officials.  Neither the retributive nor the deterrence objectives of punitive damages and of § 1983 would be significantly advanced by holding municipalities liable for such damages.  Pp. 266-271.\n",

In securing approval for the final concerts, to be held August 30 and 31, respondent sought and obtained an entertainment license from petitioner city of Newport.2  Under their written contract, respondent retained control over the choice of performers and the type of music to be played while the city reserved the right to cancel the license without liability if \"in the opinion of the City the interests of public safety demand.\"  App. 27.\n",

Shortly before the dates specified, the group Blood, Sweat and Tears was hired as a replacement for a previously engaged performer who was unable to appear.  Members of the Newport City Council, including the Mayor, became concerned that Blood, Sweat and Tears, which they characterized as a rock group rather than as a jazz band, would attract a rowdy and undesirable audience to Newport.  2 Record Appendix (R.

Id., at 195.  Officials of respondent appeared before the City Council at a special meeting the next day, and explained that Blood, Sweat and Tears in fact were a jazz band that had performed at Carnegie Hall in New York City and at similar symphony hall facilities throughout the world.  Speaking for the Council, the Mayor reiterated that the city did not condone rock festivals.  Without attempting to investigate either the nature of the group's music or the representations made by respondent, the Council voted to cancel the license for both days unless Blood, Sweat and Tears were removed from the program.

Although the City Solicitor advocated the first alternative and advised that cancellation would be unlawful, 3 R. A. at 478, the Council did not offer the first option to respondent.  Instead, one of the Council members inquired whether all provisions of the contract had been fulfilled.  The City Manager, who had just returned from the concert site, reported that the wiring together of the spectator seats was not fully completed by 3 p. m., and that the auxiliary electric generator was not in place.  Under the contract, respondent had agreed to fulfill these two conditions as part of the overall safety procedures.  App. 28.4  The Council then voted to cancel the contract because respondent had not \"lived up to all phases\" of the agreement.  4 R. A. 10.  The Council offered respondent a new contract for the same dates, specifically excluding Blood, Sweat and Tears.  Respondent, however, indicated that it would take legal action if the original contract was not honored.  1 R. A. 96;  2 R. A. 202;  4 R. A. 11.

App. 8.  At the conclusion of six days of trial, the District Court charged the jury with respect to the § 1983 and tortious interference counts. Included in its charge was an instruction, given without objection, that authorized the jury to award punitive damages against each defendant individually, \"based on the degree of culpability of the individual defendant.\" App. 62.5  The jury returned verdicts for respondent on both counts, awarding compensatory damages of $72,910 and punitive damages of $275,000;  of the punitive damages, $75,000 was spread among the seven individual officials and $200,000 was awarded against the city.6\n",

The court observed that such a failure should be overlooked \"only where the error is plain and 'has seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.' \"  Id., at 1067.

In light of Rule 51's uncompromising language9 and the policies of fairness and judicial efficiency incorporated therein, respondent claims that petitioner's failure to object to the charge at trial should foreclose any further challenge to that instruction.  The problem with respondent's argument is that the District Court in the first instance declined to accept it.  Although the punitive damages question perhaps could have been avoided simply by a reliance, under Rule 51, upon petitioner's procedural default,10 the judge concluded that the interests of justice required careful consideration of this \"novel question\" of federal law.11 Because the District Court reached and fully adjudicated the merits, and the Court of Appeals did not disagree with that adjudication, no interests in fair and effective trial administration advanced by Rule 51 would be served if we refused now to reach the merits ourselves.12\n",

      "Nor are we persuaded that our review should be limited to determining whether \"plain error\" has been committed, an exception to Rule 51 that is invoked on occasion by the Courts of Appeals absent timely objection in the trial court.13  No \"right\" to a specific standard of review exists in this setting, any more than a \"right\" to review existed at all once petitioner failed to except to the charge at trial.  But given the special circumstances of this case, limiting our review to a restrictive \"plain error\" standard would be peculiarly inapt.\n",

      "\"Plain error\" review under Rule 51 is suited to correcting obvious instances of injustice or misapplied law.  A court's interpretation of the contours of municipal liability under § 1983, as both courts below recognized, hardly could give rise to plain judicial error since those contours are currently in a state of evolving definition and uncertainty.  See Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980); Monell.  See also Maine v.

We undertake review here in order to resolve one element of the uncertainty, that is, the availability of punitive damages, and it would scarcely be appropriate or just to confine our review to determining whether any error that might exist is sufficiently egregious to qualify under Rule 51.  The very novelty of the legal issue at stake counsels unconstricted review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "In addition to being novel, the punitive damages question is important and appears likely to recur in § 1983 litigation against municipalities.14  And here the question was squarely presented and decided on a complete trial record by the court of first resort, was argued by both sides to the Court of Appeals, and has been fully briefed before this Court.  In light of all these factors, we conclude that restricting our review to the plain-error standard would serve neither to promote the interests of justice nor to advance efficient judicial administration.15  We therefore turn to the merits of petitioner's claim.16\n",

      "It is by now well settled that the tort liability created by § 1983 cannot be understood in a historical vacuum.  In the Civil Rights Act of 1871, Congress created a federal remedy against a person who, acting under color of state law, deprives another of constitutional rights.  See Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.S. 167, 172, 81 S.Ct. 473, 476, 5 L.Ed.2d 492 (1961).  Congress, however, expressed no intention to do away with the immunities afforded state officials at common law, and the Court consistently has declined to construe the general language of § 198317 as automatically abolishing such traditional immunities by implication.  Procunier v. Navarette, 434 U.S. 555, 561, 98 S.Ct. 855, 859, 55 L.Ed.2d 24 (1978);  Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 417, 96 S.Ct. 984, 988, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976);  Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 554-555, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1217-1218, 18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967);  Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.S. 367, 376, 71 S.Ct. 783, 788, 95 L.Ed. 1019 (1951).  Instead, the Court has recognized immunities of varying scope applicable to different officials sued under the statute.18  One important assumption underlying the Court's decisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar with common-law principles, including defenses previously recognized in ordinary tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common-law principles to obtain, absent specific provisions to the contrary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "At the same time, the Court's willingness to recognize certain traditional immunities as affirmative defenses has not led it to conclude that Congress incorporated all immunities existing at common law.  See Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 243, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1690, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).  Indeed, because the 1871 Act was designed to expose state and local officials to a new form of liability, it would defeat the promise of the statute to recognize any preexisting immunity without determining both the policies that it serves and its compatibility with the purposes of § 1983.  See Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S., at 424, 96 S.Ct., at 992;  id., at 434, 96 S.Ct., at 996 (opinion concurring in judgment);  Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S., at 638, 100 S.Ct., at 1409.  Only after careful inquiry into considerations of both history and policy has the Court construed § 1983 to incorporate a particular immunity defense.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "Since Monell was decided three years ago, the Court has applied this two-part approach when scrutinizing a claim of immunity proffered by a municipality.  InOwen v. City of Independence, the Court held that neither history nor policy supported a construction of § 1983 that would allow a municipality to assert the good faith of its officers or agents as a defense to liability for damages.  445 U.S., at 638, 657, 100 S.Ct., at 1409, 1418. Owen, however, concerned only compensatory damages, and petitioner contends that with respect to a municipality's liability for punitive damages, an examination of the common-law background and policy considerations yields a very different result.\n",

      "By the time Congress enacted what is now § 1983, the immunity of a municipal corporation from punitive damages at common law was not open to serious question.  It was generally understood by 1871 that a municipality, like a private corporation, was to be treated as a natural person subject to suit for a wide range of tortious activity,19 but this understanding did not extend to the award of punitive or exemplary damages. Indeed, the courts that had considered the issue prior to 1871 were virtually unanimous in denying such damages against a municipal corporation. E. g., Woodman v. Nottingham, 49 N.H. 387 (1870);  City of Chicago v. Langlass, 52 Ill. 256 (1869);  City Council of Montgomery v. Gilmer & Taylor, 33 Ala. 116 (1858); Order of Hermits of St. Augustine v. County of Philadelphia, 4 Clark 120, Brightly N.P. 116 (Pa.1847);  McGary v. President & Council of the City of Lafayette, 12 Rob. 668, 674 (La.1846).20 Judicial disinclination to award punitive damages against a municipality has persisted to the present day in the vast majority of jurisdictions.21  See generally 18 E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations § 53.18a (3d rev. ed. 1977);  F. Burdick, Law of Torts 245-246 (4th ed. 1926);  4 J. Dillon, Law of Municipal Corporations § 1712 (5th ed. 1911);  G.

      "The language of the opinions themselves is instructive as to the reasons behind this common-law tradition.  In McGary, for example, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to allow punitive damages against the city of Lafayette despite the malicious acts of its municipal officers, who had violated an injunction by ordering the demolition of plaintiff's house.  Reasoning that the officials' malice should not be attributed to the taxpaying citizens of the community, the court explained its holding:\n",

      "Of particular relevance to our current inquiry is Order of Hermits of St. Augustine v. County of Philadelphia, supra, which involved a Pennsylvania statute that authorized property owners within the county to bring damages actions against it for the destruction of their property by mob violence.22  The court observed that the \"persons\" against whom the statute authorized recovery included the county corporation, and it held that plaintiffs were entitled to compensatory damages as part of the county's duty to make reparation to its citizens for injuries sustained as a result of lawless violence.  While noting that punitive damages would have been available against the rioters themselves, the court nonetheless held that such exemplary damages were not recoverable against the county.\n",

      "The rationale of these decisions was reiterated in numerous other common-law jurisdictions.  E. g., Wilson v. City of Wheeling, 19 W.Va. 323, 350 (1882) (\"The city is not a spoliator and should not be visited by vindictive or punitive damages\"); City of Chicago v. Langlass, 52 Ill., at 259 (\"But in fixing the compensation the jury have no right to give vindictive or punitive damages, against a municipal corporation.  Against such a body they should only be compensatory, and not by way of punishment\"); City Council of Montgomery v. Gilmer & Taylor, 33 Ala., at 132 (\"The [municipal] corporation can not, upon any principle known to us, be responsible for the malice of its officers towards the plaintiffs\").  In general, courts viewed punitive damages as contrary to sound public policy, because such awards would burden the very taxpayers and citizens for whose benefit the wrongdoer was being chastised.  The courts readily distinguished between liability to compensate for injuries inflicted by a municipality's officers and agents, and vindictive damages appropriate as punishment for the bad-faith conduct of those same officers and agents.  Compensation was an obligation properly shared by the municipality itself, whereas punishment properly applied only to the actual wrongdoers.  The courts thus protected the public from unjust punishment, and the municipalities from undue fiscal constraints.23\n",

      "Because there was virtually no debate on § 1 of the Act, the Court has looked to Congress' treatment of the amendment to the Act introduced by Senator Sherman as indicative of congressional attitudes toward the nature and scope of municipal liability. Monell, 436 U.S., at 692, n. 57, 98 S.Ct., at 2036, n. 57.24 Initially, it is significant that the Sherman amendment as proposed contemplated the award of no more than compensatory damages for injuries inflicted by mob violence.  The amendment would not have exposed municipal governments to punitive damages; rather, it proposed that municipalities \"shall be liable to pay full compensation to the person or persons damnified\" by mob violence.  Globe, at 749, 755 (emphasis added).25 That the exclusion of punitive damages was no oversight was confirmed by Representative Butler, one of the amendment's chief supporters, when he responded to a critical inquiry on the floor of the House:\n",

      "Notwithstanding the compensatory focus of the amendment, its proposed extension of municipal liability met substantial resistance in Congress, resulting in its defeat on two separate occasions.26  In addition to the constitutional reservations broached by legislators, which the Court has discussed at some length in Monell, 436 U.S., at 669-683, 98 S.Ct., at 2024-2032, Members of both Chambers also expressed more practical objections. Notably, supporters as well as opponents of § 1 voiced concern that this extension of public liability might place an unmanageable financial burden on local governments.27  Legislators also expressed apprehension that innocent taxpayers would be unfairly punished for the deeds of persons over whom they had neither knowledge nor control.28  Admittedly, both these objections were raised with particular reference to the threat of the expansive municipal liability embodied in the Sherman amendment.  The two concerns are not without relevance to the present inquiry, however, in that they reflect policy considerations similar to those relied upon by the common-law courts in rejecting punitive damages awards.  We see no reason to believe that Congress' opposition to punishing innocent taxpayers and bankrupting local governments would have been less applicable with regard to the novel specter of punitive damages against municipalities.\n",

      "Finding no evidence that Congress intended to disturb the settled common-law immunity, we now must determine whether considerations of public policy dictate a contrary result.  In doing so, we examine the objectives underlying punitive damages in general, and their relationship to the goals of § 1983.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35\n",
      "Punitive damages by definition are not intended to compensate the injured party, but rather to punish the tortfeasor whose wrongful action was intentional or malicious, and to deter him and others from similar extreme conduct.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts § 908 (1979);  W. Prosser, Law of Torts 9-10 (4th ed. 1971).  Regarding retribution, it remains true that an award of punitive damages against a municipality \"punishes\" only the taxpayers, who took no part in the commission of the tort. These damages are assessed over and above the amount necessary to compensate the injured party.  Thus, there is no question here of equitably distributing the losses resulting from official misconduct.  Cf. Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S., at 657, 100 S.Ct., at 1418.  Indeed, punitive damages imposed on a municipality are in effect a windfall to a fully compensated plaintiff, and are likely accompanied by an increase in taxes or a reduction of public services for the citizens footing the bill. Neither reason nor justice suggests that such retribution should be visited upon the shoulders of blameless or unknowing taxpayers.29\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "Under ordinary principles of retribution, it is the wrongdoer himself who is made to suffer for his unlawful conduct.  If a government official acts knowingly and maliciously to deprive others of their civil rights, he may become the appropriate object of the community's vindictive sentiments.  See generally Silver v. Cormier, 529 F.2d 161, 163 (CA10 1976);  Bucher v. Krause, 200 F.2d 576, 586-588 (CA7 1952), cert. denied, 345 U.S. 997, 73 S.Ct. 1141, 97 L.Ed. 1404 (1953).  A municipality, however, can have no malice independent of the malice of its officials.  Damages awarded for punitive purposes, therefore, are not sensibly assessed against the governmental entity itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "To the extent that the purposes of § 1983 have any bearing on this punitive rationale, they do not alter our analysis.  The Court previously has indicated that punitive damages might be awarded in appropriate circumstances in order to punish violations of constitutional rights, Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 257, n. 11, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1049, n. 11, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978), but it never has suggested that punishment is as prominent a purpose under the statute as are compensation and deterrence. See, e. g., Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S., at 651, 100 S.Ct., at 1415;  Robertson v. Wegmann, 436 U.S. 584, 590-591, 98 S.Ct. 1991, 1995-1996, 56 L.Ed.2d 554 (1978);  Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S., at 256-257, 98 S.Ct., at 1048-1049.  Whatever its weight, the retributive purpose is not significantly advanced, if it is advanced at all, by exposing municipalities to punitive damages.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "The other major objective of punitive damages awards is to prevent future misconduct.  Respondent argues vigorously that deterrence is a primary purpose of § 1983, and that because punitive awards against municipalities for the malicious conduct of their policymaking officials will induce voters to condemn official misconduct through the electoral process, the threat of such awards will deter future constitutional violations.  Brief for Respondents 9-11.  Respondent is correct in asserting that the deterrence of future abuses of power by persons acting under color of state law is an important purpose of § 1983.  Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S., at 651, 100 S.Ct., at 1415;  Robertson v. Wegmann, 436 U.S., at 591, 98 S.Ct., at 1995.  It is in this context that the Court's prior statements contemplating punitive damages \"in 'a proper' § 1983 action\" should be understood. Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S. 14, 22, 100 S.Ct. 1468, 1474, 64 L.Ed.2d 15 (1980);  Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S., at 257, n. 11, 98 S.Ct., at 1049, n. 11.  For several reasons, however, we conclude that the deterrence rationale of § 1983 does not justify making punitive damages available against municipalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "39\n",
      "First, it is far from clear that municipal officials, including those at the policymaking level, would be deterred from wrongdoing by the knowledge that large punitive awards could be assessed based on the wealth of their municipality. Indemnification may not be available to the municipality under local law, and even if it were, officials likely will not be able themselves to pay such sizable awards.  Thus, assuming arguendo, that the responsible official is not impervious to shame and humiliation, the impact on the individual tortfeasor of this deterrence in the air is at best uncertain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "There also is no reason to suppose that corrective action, such as the discharge of offending officials who were appointed and the public excoriation of those who were elected, will not occur unless punitive damages are awarded against the municipality.  The Court recently observed in a related context: \"The more reasonable assumption is that responsible superiors are motivated not only by concern for the public fisc but also by concern for the Government's integrity.\"  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S., at 21, 100 S.Ct., at 1473.  This assumption is no less applicable to the electorate at large.  And if additional protection is needed, the compensatory damages that are available against a municipality may themselves induce the public to vote the wrongdoers out of office.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "41\n",
      "Moreover, there is available a more effective means of deterrence.  By allowing juries and courts to assess punitive damages in appropriate circumstances against the offending official, based on his personal financial resources, the statute directly advances the public's interest in preventing repeated constitutional deprivations.30  In our view, this provides sufficient protection against the prospect that a public official may commit recurrent constitutional violations by reason of his office.  The Court previously has found, with respect to such violations, that a damages remedy recoverable against individuals is more effective as a deterrent than the threat of damages against a government employer.  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.S., at 21, 100 S.Ct., at 1473.  We see no reason to depart from that conclusion here, especially since the imposition of additional penalties would most likely fall upon the citizen-taxpayer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "42\n",
      "Finally, although the benefits associated with awarding punitive damages against municipalities under § 1983 are of doubtful character, the costs may be very real.  In light of the Court's decision last Term in Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980), the § 1983 damages remedy may now be available for violations of federal statutory as well as constitutional law.  But cf. Middlesex County Sewerage Authority v. National Sea Clammers Ass'n, 453 U.S. 1, 101 S.Ct. 2615, 69 L.Ed.2d 435.  Under this expanded liability, municipalities and other units of state and local government face the possibility of having to assure compensation for persons harmed by abuses of governmental authority covering a large range of activity in everyday life.  To add the burden of exposure for the malicious conduct of individual government employees may create a serious risk to the financial integrity of these governmental entities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "The Court has remarked elsewhere on the broad discretion traditionally accorded to juries in assessing the amount of punitive damages.  Electrical Workers v. Foust, 442 U.S. 42, 50-51, 99 S.Ct. 2121, 2127, 60 L.Ed.2d 698 (1979);  Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 349-350, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3011-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974).  Because evidence of a tortfeasor's wealth is traditionally admissible as a measure of the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded,31 the unlimited taxing power of a municipality may have a prejudicial impact on the jury, in effect encouraging it to impose a sizable award.  The impact of such a windfall recovery is likely to be both unpredictable and, at times, substantial, and we are sensitive to the possible strain on local treasuries and therefore on services available to the public at large.32  Absent a compelling reason for approving such an award, not present here, we deem it unwise to inflict the risk.\n",

      "44\n",
      "In sum, we find that considerations of history and policy do not support exposing a municipality to punitive damages for the bad-faith actions of its officials.  Because absolute immunity from such damages obtained at common law and was undisturbed by the 42d Congress, and because that immunity is compatible with both the purposes of § 1983 and general principles of public policy, we hold that a municipality is immune from punitive damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

Whatever the proper scope of such a doctrine,5 courts and commentators uniformly agree that it should be applied only in exceptional circumstances.  As the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit has noted:  \" 'If there is to be a plain error exception to Rule 51 at all, it should be confined to the exceptional case where the error has seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.' \"  Morris v.

But most of the issues before this Court are novel and likely to recur:  that is why they are considered worthy of certiorari.

There is no reason to treat punitive damages instructions differently from other instructions for Rule 51 purposes.  See Whiting v.

      " In the face of this history, respondent acknowledged at oral argument that in 1871 the common law did not contemplate the imposition of punitive damages against municipalities, but contended that the functional equivalent was achieved through the respondeat superior liability to which municipalities were, and still are, exposed.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  Apparently, respondent argues that because municipalities were liable for the conduct of their agents, including conduct over which their executive officials had no actual responsibility or knowledge, it would have been unnecessary to expose them to punitive damages with regard to the same conduct.  This argument, however, does not alter the persuasiveness of the prevalent common-law immunity;  if anything, it goes to the soundness of the common-law defense at that time and now.  Moreover, the respondeat superior doctrine did not cover all instances in which the municipality could assert immunity in its own capacity.  E. g., City Council of Montgomery v. Gilmer & Taylor;  McGary v. President & Council of Lafayette.  See G.

      " The legislative background of § 1983 is exhaustively addressed in Monell, 436 U.S., at 664-695, 98 S.Ct., at 2022, 2038.  Briefly, the Sherman amendment was a proposed addition to the statute, and was defended by its sponsor as an attempt to enlist the aid of persons of property in suppressing the lawless violence of the Ku Klux Klan.  See Globe, at 760-761.  In its initial form, the amendment imposed liability on any inhabitant of a municipality for damage inflicted by persons \"riotously and tumultuously assembled.\"  Id., at 663, 98 S.Ct., at 2021.  That version was passed by the Senate but overwhelmingly rejected by the House.  Id., at 704-705, 725, 98 S.Ct., at 2042-2043, 2053.  A first conference substitute was then proposed.  Id., at 749, 755. The substitute version placed liability directly on the local government, regardless of whether the municipality had had notice of the impending riot, had made reasonable efforts to stop it, or was even authorized under state law to exercise police power.  See Monell, 436 U.S., at 668, 98 S.Ct., at 2024.  The conference substitute also created a lien which ran against \"all moneys in the treasury,\" thus permitting execution against public property such as jails and courthouses.  It was generally understood that the extent of the proposed public liability went beyond what was contemplated under § 1.  After much debate, the amendment passed the Senate but was again rejected by the House.  Globe, at 779, 800-801.  It is from the debate over the first conference substitute that we glean \"clue[s]\" as to Congress' views on municipal liability.  Monell, 436 U.S., at 692, n. 57, 98 S.Ct., at 2036, n. 57.\n",

      "The Court thus relies on 19th-century case law for the proposition that municipalities may not be held liable for punitive damages, without distinguishing between the common situation in which municipal liability is predicated on a theory of respondeat superior, and the more unusual situation in which the violation is committed in accordance with official governmental policy.  See ante, at 259-263. Only in the latter situation have we held that a municipality may be sued under § 1983, Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 690-691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-2036, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978).  It is in the latter context that the Court's cited precedent is least relevant, and that its concern for \"blameless or unknowing taxpayers,\" ante, at 267, is least compelling.  Indeed, when the elected representatives of the people adopt a municipal policy that violates the Constitution, it seems perfectly reasonable to impose punitive damages on those ultimately responsible for the policy—the citizens.\n",

It is difficult to understand how the Court can purport to avoid this question, when it vacates a judgment predicated squarely on that doctrine.  Nevertheless, I will join with the Court in leaving open the issue of the scope of exceptions to Rule 51, if any, to another day.

I suspect that the Court has not considered the broad repercussions of its treatment of the procedural default in this case, or the incongruity of its result in light of parallel procedural requirements in the criminal area.  The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which contain a provision—similar to Rule 51—that \"[n]o party may assign as error any portion of the charge of omission therefrom unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict,\" Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 30, also contain another provision:  \"Plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\"  Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 52(b).  The absence of a similar provision in the Civil Rules suggests that review of unchallenged jury instructions is intended to be more restrictive under the Civil than under the Criminal Rules.  The Court's conclusion that petitioners' claim in this civil case should be heard despite the absence of plain error thus inverts the Rules, in violation of their spirit as well as their letter.\n",
      "Similarly, certain procedural defaults in state and federal criminal trials preclude federal habeas relief in the absence of \"cause\" and \"prejudice.\"  See Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.S. 72, 90-91, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 2508-2509 (1977);  Davis v. United States, 411 U.S. 233, 242-245, 93 S.Ct. 1577, 1582-1584, 36 L.Ed.2d 216 (1973).  The Court's conclusion that petitioners' claim should be heard despite the absence of any claim of \"cause\" and \"prejudice\" thus suggests that the courts should be stricter in enforcing procedural rules against prisoners facing incarceration than against civil defendants facing money judgments.  The Court's priorities seem backwards to me.\n",

      "Barcelona.com, Inc. (\"Bcom, Inc.\"), a Delaware corporation, commenced this action under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act against Excelentisimo Ayuntamiento de Barcelona (the City Council of Barcelona, Spain) for a declaratory judgment that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of the domain name <barcelona.com> is not unlawful under the Lanham Act (Chapter 22 of Title 15 of the United States Code). The district court concluded that Bcom, Inc.'s use of <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to Spanish trademarks owned by the City Council that include the word \"Barcelona.\" Also finding bad faith on the basis that Bcom, Inc. had attempted to sell the <barcelona.com> domain name to the City Council for a profit, the court ordered the transfer of the domain name to the City Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "2\n",
      "Because the district court applied Spanish law rather than United States law and based its transfer order, in part, on a counterclaim that the City Council never filed, we reverse the judgment of the district court denying Bcom, Inc. relief under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, vacate its memorandum opinion and its order to transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",

      "* In 1996, Mr. Joan Nogueras Cobo (\"Nogueras\"), a Spanish citizen, registered the domain name <barcelona.com> in the name of his wife, also a Spanish citizen, with the domain registrar, Network Solutions, Inc., in Herndon, Virginia. In the application for registration of the domain name, Nogueras listed himself as the administrative contact. When Nogueras met Mr. Shahab Hanif, a British citizen, in June 1999, they developed a business plan to turn <barcelona.com> into a tourist portal for the Barcelona, Spain, region. A few months later they formed Bcom, Inc. under Delaware law to own <barcelona.com> and to run the website, and Nogueras, his wife, and Hanif became Bcom, Inc.'s officers. Bcom, Inc. was formed as an American company in part because Nogueras believed that doing so would facilitate obtaining financing for the development of the website. Although Bcom, Inc. maintains a New York mailing address, it has no employees in the United States, does not own or lease office space in the United States, and does not have a telephone listing in the United States. Its computer server is in Spain.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "Shortly after Nogueras registered the domain name <barcelona.com> in 1996, he placed some Barcelona-related information on the site. The site offered commercial services such as domain registry and web hosting, but did not offer much due to the lack of financing. Before developing the business plan with Hanif, Nogueras used a web-form on the City Council's official website to e-mail the mayor of Barcelona, Spain, proposing to \"negotiate\" with the City Council for its acquisition of the domain name <barcelona.com>, but Nogueras received no response. And even after the development of a business plan and after speaking with potential investors, Nogueras was unable to secure financing to develop the website.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "In March 2000, about a year after Nogueras had e-mailed the Mayor, the City Council contacted Nogueras to learn more about Bcom, Inc. and its plans for the domain name <barcelona.com>. Nogueras and his marketing director met with City Council representatives, and after the meeting, sent them the business plan that was developed for Bcom, Inc.\n",

      "6\n",
      "On May 3, 2000, a lawyer for the City Council sent a letter to Nogueras demanding that Nogueras transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council. The City Council owned about 150 trademarks issued in Spain, the majority of which included the word Barcelona, such as \"Teatre Barcelona,\" \"Barcelona Informacio I Grafic,\" and \"Barcelona Informacio 010 El Tlefon Que Ho Contesta Tot.\" Its earlier effort in 1995 to register the domain name <barcelona.es>, however, was unsuccessful. The City Council's representative explained, \"It was denied to Barcelona and to all place names in Spain.\" This representative also explained that the City Council did not try also to register <barcelona.com> in 1995 even though that domain name was available because \"[a]t that time ... the world Internet that we know now was just beginning and it was not seen as a priority by the City Council.\" The City Council now took the position with Bcom, Inc. that its domain name <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to numerous trademarks that the City Council owned.\n",

      "A couple of days after the City Council sent its letter, Nogueras had the domain name <barcelona.com> transferred from his wife's name to Bcom, Inc., which he had neglected to do in 1999 when Bcom, Inc. was formed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Upon Bcom, Inc.'s refusal to transfer <barcelona.com> to the City Council, the City Council invoked the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\"UDRP\") promulgated by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (\"ICANN\") to resolve the dispute. Every domain name issued by Network Solutions, Inc. is issued under a contract, the terms of which include a provision requiring resolution of disputes through the UDRP. In accordance with that policy, the City Council filed an administrative complaint with the World Intellectual Property Organization (\"WIPO\"), an ICANN-authorized dispute-resolution provider located in Switzerland. The complaint sought transfer of the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council and relied on Spanish law in asserting that Bcom, Inc. had no rights to the domain name while the City Council had numerous Spanish trademarks that contained the word \"Barcelona.\" As part of its complaint, the City Council agreed \"to be subject to the jurisdiction of the registrant[']s residence, the Courts of Virginia (United States), only with respect to any challenge that may be made by the Respondent to a decision by the Administrative Panel to transfer or cancel the domain names that are [the] subject of this complaint.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "The administrative complaint was resolved by a single WIPO panelist who issued a ruling in favor of the City Council on August 4, 2000. The WIPO panelist concluded that <barcelona.com> was confusingly similar to the City Council's Spanish trademarks, that Bcom, Inc. had no legitimate interest in <barcelona.com>, and that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> was in bad faith. To support his conclusion that Bcom, Inc. acted in bad faith, the WIPO panelist observed that the only purpose of the business plan was \"to commercially exploit information about the City of Barcelona... particularly ... the information prepared and provided by [the City Council] as part of its public service.\" The WIPO panelist ordered that Bcom, Inc. transfer the domain name <barcelona.com> to the City Council.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "In accordance with the UDRP's provision that required a party aggrieved by the dispute resolution process to file any court challenge within ten business days, Bcom, Inc. commenced this action on August 18, 2000 under the provision of the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (the \"ACPA\") that authorizes a domain name owner to seek recovery or restoration of its domain name when a trademark owner has overstepped its authority in causing the domain name to be suspended, disabled, or transferred. See 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Bcom, Inc.'s complaint sought a declaratory judgment that its use of the name <barcelona.com> \"does not infringe upon any trademark of defendant or cause confusion as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of the website <barcelona.com>;... [and] that [the City Council] is barred from instituting any action against [Bcom, Inc.] for trademark infringement.\" While the City Council answered the complaint and stated, as an affirmative defense, that the court lacked jurisdiction over the City Council for any cause of action other than Bcom, Inc.'s \"challenge to the arbitrator's Order issued in the UDRP domain name arbitration proceeding,\" the City Council filed no counterclaim to assert any trademark rights.\n",
      "\n",

      "Following a bench trial, the district court entered a memorandum opinion and an order dated February 22, 2002, denying Bcom, Inc.'s request for declaratory judgment and directing Bcom, Inc. to \"transfer the domain name barcelona.com to the [City Council] forthwith.\" 189 F.Supp.2d 367, 377 (E.D.Va.2002). Although the district court concluded that the WIPO panel ruling \"should be given no weight and this case must be decided based on the evidence presented before the Court,\" the court proceeded in essence to apply the WIPO panelist opinion as well as Spanish law. Id. at 371. The court explained that even though the City Council did not own a trademark in the name \"Barcelona\" alone, it owned numerous Spanish trademarks that included the word Barcelona, which could, under Spanish law as understood by the district court, be enforced against an infringing use such as <barcelona.com>. Id. Adopting the WIPO panelist's decision, the court stated that \"the WIPO decision was correct in its determination that [Bcom, Inc.] took `advantage of the normal confusion' of an Internet user by using the `Barcelona route' because an Internet userwould `normally expect to reach some official body ... for ... the information.'\" Id. at 372. Referring to the facts that Bcom, Inc. engaged in little activity and attempted to sell the domain name to the City Council, the court concluded that \"these factors clearly demonstrate a bad faith intent on the part of the Plaintiff and its sole shareholders to improperly profit from their registration of the domain name barcelona.com.\" At bottom, the court concluded that Bcom, Inc. failed to demonstrate, as required by 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v), that its use of <barcelona.com> was \"not unlawful.\" Id. at 373.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "In addition to concluding that Bcom, Inc. failed to establish its claim, the court stated that it was also deciding the City Council's counterclaim for relief under 15 U.S.C. § 1125 and determined that \"the Spanish trademark `Barcelona' is valid for purposes of the ACPA.\" Id. at 374. Applying the factors of 15 U.S.C. § 1125(2)(d)(1)(B)(i), the court found that Nogueras and his wife acted with \"bad faith intent\" in registering <barcelona.com> as a domain name. Id. at 374-76. The court also found that <barcelona.com> \"is confusingly similar to the defendant's mark.\" Id. at 376.\n",

      "[T]rial courts may consider rights in foreign trademarks which were asserted in the transfer decision under review. The [WIPO] administrative transfer proceeding itself gives the district court both subject matter and personal jurisdiction; jurisdiction is not dependent upon allegations of U.S. trademark rights. Therefore, failure to consider the basis for the administrative decision would remove the basis for jurisdiction, and require dismissal of the case.

      "Bcom, Inc.'s complaint, brought in the Eastern District of Virginia where the domain name <barcelona.com> was registered with Network Solutions, Inc., originally asserted three claims in three separate counts: a claim for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v); a claim for fraud and unfair competition; and a claim for tortious interference with prospective economic advantage. In response to the City Council's motion to dismiss on various jurisdictional grounds, Bcom, Inc. voluntarily dismissed all claims except its claim under § 1114(2)(D)(v). After the district court denied the City Council's motion to dismiss, the City Council filed an answer, stating as one of its affirmative defenses:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "This court lacks jurisdiction over Defendant regarding any cause of action other than Plaintiff's challenge to the arbitrator's Order issued in the UDRP domain name arbitration proceeding.\n",

      "23\n",
      "This statement reflects the City Council's stipulation that when it filed the WIPO administrative claim in Switzerland, \"the City Council agreed to be subject to the jurisdiction of `the Courts of Virginia (United States), only with respect to any challenge that may be made by the Respondent to a decision by the Administrative Panel to transfer or cancel the domain names that are [the] subject of this complaint.'\" Accordingly, at least with respect to a claim brought under § 1114(2)(D)(v), the City Council agrees that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the City Council.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "Apparently, the City Council does not dispute these jurisdictional observations as far as they go. It contends, however, that jurisdiction to hear a claim under § 1114(2)(D)(v) rests on a recognition of the WIPO proceeding and the law that the WIPO panelist applied. Although we agree with the City Council that the WIPO proceeding is relevant to a claim under § 1114(2)(D)(v), it is not jurisdictional; indeed, the WIPO panelist's decision is not even entitled to deference on the merits. A brief review of the scheme established by ICANN in adopting the UDRP and by Congress in enacting the ACPA informs our resolution of this issue.\n",

      "A domain name is \"any alphanumeric designation which is registered with or assigned by any domain name registrar, domain name registry, or other domain name registration authority as part of an electronic address on the Internet.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1127. To obtain a domain name, a would-be registrant simply makes application to a registrar (there are currently over 160), submits a fee, and agrees to the terms of the domain name registration agreement. Domain names are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.\n",
      "\n",

      "It also provides a contractually mandated process, the UDRP, for resolution of disputes that might arise between domain name registrants and trademark owners. The UDRP is intended to provide a quick process for resolving domain name disputes by submitting them to authorized panels or panel members operating under rules of procedure established by ICANN and under \"any rules and principles of law that [the panel] deems applicable.\" ICANN, Rules for Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy, ¶ 15(a), at http:// www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/uniform-rules.htm (Oct. 24, 1999).\n",

      "29\n",
      "Because the administrative process prescribed by the UDRP is \"adjudication lite\" as a result of its streamlined nature and its loose rules regarding applicable law, the UDRP itself contemplates judicial intervention, which can occur before, during, or after the UDRP's dispute-resolution process is invoked. See ICANN, UDRP ¶ 3(b), at http://www.icann.org/dndr/udrp/policy.htm (Oct. 24, 1999) (stating that the registrar will cancel or transfer the domain name upon the registrar's \"receipt of an order from a court or arbitral tribunal, in each case of competent jurisdiction, requiring such action\"); id. at ¶ 4(k) (\"The mandatory administrative proceeding requirements set forth in Paragraph 4 shall not prevent either you or the complainant from submitting the dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction for independent resolution before such mandatory administrative proceeding is commenced or after such proceeding is concluded\"); id. (providing that the registrar will stay implementation of the administrative panel's decision if the registrant commences \"a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted\" under the applicable UDRP rule of procedure). As ICANN recognized in designing the UDRP, allowing recourse to full-blown adjudication under a particular nation's law is necessary to prevent abuse of the UDRP process. See id. at ¶ 1 (defining \"reverse domain name hijacking\" as use of the UDRP \"in bad faith to attempt to deprive a registered domain-name holder of a domain name\"). Thus, when a person obtains a domain name, the person agrees, in the registration contract with the registrar, to follow the UDRP as established by ICANN.\n",

      "In 1999, Congress amended the Trademark Act of 1946 (the Lanham Act) with the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), Pub.L. No. 106-113, § 3001 et seq., 113 Stat. 1501A-545 (codified in scattered sections of 15 U.S.C.), principally for the purpose of protecting trademark owners against cyberpiracy:\n",

      "The purpose of the bill is to protect consumers and American businesses, to promote the growth of online commerce, and to provide clarity in the law for trademark owners by prohibiting the bad-faith and abusive registration of distinctive marks as Internet domain names with the intent to profit from the goodwill associated with such marks — a practice commonly referred to as \"cybersquatting.\"\n",

      "32\n",
      "S. Rep. No. 106-140, at 4 (1999). Although the ACPA was enacted primarily to redress cyberpiracy or \"cybersquatting,\" it also provides limited liability for trademark infringement by registrars who participate in the administration of the registration, transfer, and cancellation of domain names pursuant to a \"reasonable policy\" that is consistent with the purposes of the trademark laws. See 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(i)-(iii). And to balance the rights given to trademark owners against cybersquatters, the ACPA also provides some protection to domain name registrants against \"overreaching trademark owners.\" S.Rep. No. 106-140, at 11; see also 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(iv)-(v). Thus, § 1114(2)(D)(v) authorizes a domain name registrant to sue trademark owners for \"reverse domain name hijacking.\"1 Under that reverse domain name hijacking provision, a domain name registrant who is aggrieved by an overreaching trademark owner may commence an action to declare that the domain name registration or use by the registrant is not unlawful under the Lanham Act. This section provides that the court may \"grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v).\n",

      "33\n",
      "In sum, domain names are issued pursuant to contractual arrangements under which the registrant agrees to a dispute resolution process, the UDRP, which is designed to resolve a large number of disputes involving domain names, but this process is not intended to interfere with or modify any \"independent resolution\" by a court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, the UDRP makes no effort at unifying the law of trademarks among the nations served by the Internet. Rather, it forms part of a contractual policy developed by ICANN for use by registrars in administering the issuance and transfer of domain names. Indeed, it explicitly anticipates that judicial proceedings will continue under various nations' laws applicable to the parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "34\n",
      "The ACPA recognizes the UDRP only insofar as it constitutes a part of a policy followed by registrars in administering domain names, and the UDRP is relevant to actions brought under the ACPA in two contexts. First, the ACPA limits the liability of a registrar in respect to registering, transferring, disabling, or cancelling a domain name if it is done in the \"implementation of a reasonable policy\" (including the UDRP) that prohibits registration of a domain name \"identical to, confusingly similar to, or dilutive of another's mark.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II) (emphasis added). Second, the ACPA authorizes a suit by a domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled or transferred under that reasonable policy (including the UDRP) to seek a declaration that the registrant's registration and use of the domain name involves no violation of the Lanham Act as well as an injunction returning the domain name.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "35\n",
      "Thus, while a decision by an ICANN-recognized panel might be a condition of, indeed the reason for, bringing an action under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v), its recognition vel non is not jurisdictional. Jurisdiction to hear trademark matters is conferred on federal courts by 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1338, and a claim brought under the ACPA, which amended the Lanham Act, is a trademark matter over which federal courts have subject matter jurisdiction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "Moreover, any decision made by a panel under the UDRP is no more than an agreed-upon administration that is not given any deference under the ACPA. To the contrary, because a UDRP decision is susceptible of being grounded on principles foreign or hostile to American law, the ACPA authorizes reversing a panel decision if such a result is called for by application of the Lanham Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "In sum, we conclude that we have jurisdiction over this dispute brought under the ACPA and the Lanham Act.

Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 373-74 (3d Cir.2003) (holding that 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) requires the federal court to approach the issues raised in an action brought under that provision de novo rather than to apply the deferential review appropriate to actions governed by the Federal Arbitration Act); Sallen v. Corinthians Licenciamentos LTDA, 273 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir.2001) (explaining that \"a federal court's interpretation of the ACPA supplants a WIPO panel's interpretation of the UDRP\").

      "\n",
      "40\n",
      "A domain name registrant whose domain name has been suspended, disabled, or transferred under a policy described under clause (ii)(II) may, upon notice to the mark owner, file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter. The court may grant injunctive relief to the domain name registrant, including the reactivation of the domain name or transfer of the domain name to the domain name registrant.\n",

      "15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Thus, to establish a right to relief against an \"overreaching trademark owner\" under this reverse hijacking provision, a plaintiff must establish (1) that it is a domain name registrant; (2) that its domain name was suspended, disabled, or transferred under a policy implemented by a registrar as described in 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II); (3) that the owner of the mark that prompted the domain name to be suspended, disabled, or transferred has notice of the action by service or otherwise; and (4) that the plaintiff's registration or use of the domain name is not unlawful under the Lanham Act, as amended.\n",

      "The parties do not dispute that the first two elements are satisfied. Bcom, Inc. is a domain name registrant, and its domain name was suspended, disabled, or transferred under Network Solutions' policy, i.e., the UDRP incorporated into the domain name registration agreement for <barcelona.com>. Although the domain name had not actually been transferred from Bcom, Inc. as of the time that Bcom, Inc. commenced this action, the WIPO panelist had already ordered the transfer, and as a result of this order the transfer was certain to occur absent the filing of this action to stop it. By filing this suit, Bcom, Inc. obtained an automatic stay of the transfer order by virtue of paragraph 4(k) of the UDRP, which provides that the registrar will stay implementation of the administrative panel's decision if the registrant commences \"a lawsuit against the complainant in a jurisdiction to which the complainant has submitted\" under the applicable UDRP rule of procedure. See ICANN, UDRP ¶ 4(k). Moreover, this suit for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief under § 1114(2)(D)(v) appears to be precisely the mechanism designed by Congress to empower a party whose domain name is subject to a transfer order like the one in the present case to prevent the order from being implemented. See Sallen, 273 F.3d at 25 n. 11 (\"We think that § 1114(2)(D)(ii)(II), the statutory provision referenced in § 1114(2)(D)(v), covers situations where a transfer by [the registrar] is inevitable unless a court action is filed\").\n",

      "It is the last element that raises the principal issue on appeal. Bcom, Inc. argues that the district court erred in deciding whether Bcom, Inc. satisfied this element by applying Spanish law and then by concluding that Bcom, Inc.'s use of the domain name violated Spanish law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "45\n",
      "It appears from the district court's memorandum opinion that it indeed did resolve the last element by applying Spanish law. Although the district court recognized that the City Council did not have a registered trademark in the name \"Barcelona\" alone, either in Spain or in the United States, it observed that \"[u]nder Spanish law, when trademarks consisting of two or more words contain one word that stands out in a predominant manner, that dominant word must be given decisive relevance.\" Barcelona.com, Inc., 189 F.Supp.2d at 371-72. The court noted that \"the term `Barcelona' has been included in many trademarks consisting of two or more words owned by the City Council of Barcelona. In most of these marks, the word `Barcelona' is clearly the dominant word which characterizes the mark.\" Id. at 372. These observations regarding the substance and effect of Spanish law led the court to conclude that the City Council of Barcelona \"owns a legally valid Spanish trademark for the dominant word `Barcelona.'\" Id. The district court then proceeded to determine whether Bcom's \"use of the Barcelona trademark is `not unlawful.'\" Id. In this portion of its analysis, the district court determined that there was a \"confusing similarity between the barcelona.com domain name and the marks held by the Council,\" id., and that \"the circumstances surrounding the incorporation of [Bcom, Inc.] and the actions taken by Nogueras in attempting to sell the domain name evidence[d] a bad faith intent to profit from the registration of a domain name containing the Council's mark,\" id. Applying Spanish trademark law in this manner, the court resolved that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> were unlawful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "It requires little discussion to demonstrate that this use of Spanish law by the district court was erroneous under the plain terms of the statute. The text of the ACPA explicitly requires application of the Lanham Act, not foreign law, to resolve an action brought under 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v). Specifically, it authorizes an aggrieved domain name registrant to \"file a civil action to establish that the registration or use of the domain name by such registrant is not unlawful under this chapter.\" 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) (emphasis added).2 It is thus readily apparent that the cause of action created by Congress in this portion of the ACPA requires the court adjudicating such an action to determine whether the registration or use of the domain name violates the Lanham Act. Because the statutory language has a plain and unambiguous meaning that is consistent with the statutory context and application of this language in accordance with its plain meaning provides a component of a coherent statutory scheme, our statutory analysis need proceed no further. See Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997) (\"Our first step in interpreting a statute is to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular dispute in the case. Our inquiry must cease if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent\" (quotation marks omitted)).\n",

      "47\n",
      "By requiring application of United States trademark law to this action brought in a United States court by a United States corporation involving a domain name administered by a United States registrar, 15 U.S.C. § 1114(2)(D)(v) is consistent with the fundamental doctrine of territoriality upon which our trademark law is presently based. Both the United States and Spain have long adhered to the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property. See Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of 1883 (the \"Paris Convention\"), opened for signature Mar. 20, 1883, 25 Stat. 1372, as amended at Stockholm, opened for signature July 14, 1967, 21 U.S.T. 1583. Section 44 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1126, incorporates the Paris Convention into United States law, but only \"to provide foreign nationals with rights under United States law which are coextensive with the substantive provisions of the treaty involved.\" Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 958 F.2d 594, 597 (4th Cir. 1992); see also Int'l Cafe, S.A.L. v. Hard Rock Cafe Int'l (U.S.A.), Inc., 252 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2001) (\"[T]he rights articulated in the Paris Convention do not exceed the rights conferred by the Lanham Act\"). The relevant substantive provision in this case is Article 6(3) of the Paris Convention, which implements the doctrine of territoriality by providing that \"[a] mark duly registered in a country of the [Paris] Union shall be regarded as independent of marks registered in the other countries of the Union, including the country of origin.\" Paris Convention, supra, art. 6(3). As one distinguished commentary explains, \"the Paris Convention creates nothing that even remotely resembles a `world mark' or an `international registration.' Rather, it recognizes the principle of the territoriality of trademarks [in the sense that] a mark exists only under the laws of each sovereign nation.\" 4 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 29:25 (4th ed.2002).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "It follows from incorporation of the doctrine of territoriality into United States law through Section 44 of the Lanham Act that United States courts do not entertain actions seeking to enforce trademark rights that exist only under foreign law. See Person's Co., Ltd. v. Christman, 900 F.2d 1565, 1568-69 (Fed.Cir.1990) (\"The concept of territoriality is basic to trademark law; trademark rights exist in each country solely according to that country's statutory scheme\"). Yet the district court's application of foreign law in this declaratory judgment action did precisely this and thereby neglected to apply United States law as required by the statute.\n",

      "\n",
      "49\n",
      "When we apply the Lanham Act, not Spanish law, in determining whether Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of <barcelona.com> is unlawful, the ineluctable conclusion follows that Bcom, Inc.'s registration and use of the name \"Barcelona\" is not unlawful. Under the Lanham Act, and apparently even under Spanish law, the City Council could not obtain a trademark interest in a purely descriptive geographical designation that refers only to the City of Barcelona. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(2); see also Spanish Trademark Law of 1988, Art. 11(1)(c) (forbidding registration of marks consisting exclusively of \"geographical origin\"). Under United States trademark law, a geographic designation can obtain trademark protection if that designation acquires secondary meaning. See, e.g., Resorts of Pinehurst, Inc. v. Pinehurst Nat'l Corp., 148 F.3d 417, 421 (4th Cir.1998). On the record in this case, however, there was no evidence that the public — in the United States or elsewhere — associates \"Barcelona\" with anything other than the City itself. Indeed, the Chief Director of the City Council submitted an affidavit stating that \"[t]he City does not own and is not using any trademarks in the United States, to identify any goods or services.\" Therefore, under United States trademark law, \"Barcelona\" should have been treated as a purely descriptive geographical term entitled to no trademark protection. See 15 U.S.C. § 1052(e)(2). It follows then that there was nothing unlawful about Nogueras' registration of <barcelona.com>, nor is there anything unlawful under United States trademark law about Bcom, Inc.'s continued use of that domain name.3\n",

The court devoted approximately half of its opinion to issues arising out of this alleged counterclaim and, in this section of its opinion, issued rulings (1) that claims may be brought under 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d) premised on the violation of foreign marks because the statute's coverage is not limited to violations of United States trademarks, id. at 373-74, (2) that Bcom acted with a bad faith intent to profit under the nine nonexclusive factors set forth in 15 U.S.C. § 1125(d)(1)(B), id. at 374-76, and (3) that <barcelona.com> was \"confusingly similar\" to the City Council's Spanish trademarks which \"contain the term'Barcelona' as the dominant element,\" id. at 376.\n",

In response, defendants filed a counterclaim under the Lanham Act based on RSI's use of the word \"freebie\" in its domain name, asserting claims for trademark infringement and cybersquatting. Additionally, defendants included Lanham Act claims for unfair competition and trademark dilution. See 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(a), (c) (West 1998 & Supp.2003). Defendants also alleged that RSI's <freebie.com> domain name violated section 18.2-500 of the Virginia Code.\n",

      "Before we recount the facts of this case, a brief discussion of the legal context in which the facts arise is helpful. Trademarks \"identify and distinguish\" goods produced by one person \"from those manufactured or sold by others and ... indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127 (West Supp.2003). To the purchasing public, a trademark \"signif[ies] that all goods bearing the trademark\" originated from the same source and \"that all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of quality.\" 1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 3.2 (4th ed.2003) [hereinafter McCarthy]. Because of its role in assuring consumers of the origin and quality of the associated goods, a trademark is also \"a prime instrument in advertising and selling the goods.\" Id.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Thus, a proposed mark cannot acquire trademark protection unless the mark is distinctive, that is, unless it serves the traditional trademark functions of \"distinguishing the applicant's goods from those of others\" and identifying the source of the goods. Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052 (West 1997). The antithesis of a distinctive mark is a \"generic\" mark which merely employs \"the common name of a product or service,\" Sara Lee Corp. v. Kayser-Roth Corp., 81 F.3d 455, 464 (4th Cir.1996), or \"refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species,\" Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 194, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). Because a generic mark, by definition, neither signifies the source of goods nor distinguishes the particular product from other products on the market, a generic term cannot be protected as a trademark nor registered as one. See Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 768, 112 S.Ct. 2753; Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464; Larsen v. Terk Techs. Corp., 151 F.3d 140, 148 (4th Cir.1998) (noting that \"`generic marks' are accorded no protection at all....\"). \"The concepts of `generic name' and `trademark' are mutually exclusive\" because a generic term \"can never function as a mark to identify and distinguish the products of only one seller.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:1. From a policy standpoint, of course, if a business were permitted to appropriate a generic word as its trademark, it would be \"difficult for competitors to market their own brands of the same product. Imagine being forbidden to describe a Chevrolet as a `car' or an `automobile' because Ford or Chrysler or Volvo had trademarked these generic words.\" Blau Plumbing, Inc. v. S.O.S. Fix-It, Inc., 781 F.2d 604, 609 (7th Cir.1986).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "Whether trademark protection extends to a proposed mark is tied to the mark's distinctiveness. See Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464. In determining the distinctiveness of a given mark, courts use a categorical approach, placing the mark in one of four classifications that increase in distinctiveness as follows: generic, descriptive, suggestive, and arbitrary or fanciful. See Pizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1527 (4th Cir.1984). On the opposite end of the spectrum from the generic category are marks that are fanciful or arbitrary — inherently distinctive marks. Fanciful marks are, for the most part, nonsense \"words expressly coined for serving as a trademark.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (offering \"Clorox®, Kodak®, Polaroid®, and Exxon®\" as examples). Arbitrary marks consist of recognizable words used in connection with products for which \"they do not suggest or describe any quality, ingredient, or characteristic,\" as if the trademark was \"arbitrarily assigned.\" Id. (citing \"Camel® cigarettes\" and \"Apple® computers\" as examples).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "Between the generic and the arbitrary or fanciful categories are descriptive marks and suggestive marks, which are often difficult to distinguish from each other. Descriptive marks \"merely describe a function, use, characteristic, size, or intended purpose of the product.\" Id. (mentioning \"After Tan post-tanning lotion\" and \"5 Minute Glue\"). Descriptive marks are not inherently distinctive; the Lanham Act \"accord[s] protection only if they have acquired a `secondary meaning.'\" Larsen, 151 F.3d at 148; see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1052(e)(1) (registration may be refused if the proposed mark, \"when used on or in connection with the goods of the applicant[,] is merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive of them\"). Saying that a trademark has acquired \"secondary meaning\" is shorthand for saying that a descriptive mark has become sufficiently distinctive to establish \"a mental association in buyers' minds between the alleged mark and a single source of the product.\" 2 McCarthy at § 15:5; see Two Pesos, 505 U.S. at 769, 112 S.Ct. 2753 (\"This acquired distinctiveness\" necessary for a descriptive mark to be protected \"is generally called `secondary meaning.'\"); Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (explaining that \"secondary meaning\" exists when, \"in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature or term is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "In contrast to descriptive marks, suggestive marks are inherently distinctive and, like arbitrary or fanciful marks, qualify for registration without any showing of \"secondary meaning.\" See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. A mark is suggestive if it \"connote[s], without describing, some quality, ingredient, or characteristic of the product.\" Sara Lee, 81 F.3d at 464 (providing the following examples: \"Coppertone®, Orange Crush®, and Playboy®\"). A helpful rule of thumb is that \"`if the mark imparts information directly, it is descriptive,'\" but \"`[i]f it stands for an idea which requires some operation of the imagination to connect it with the goods, it is suggestive.'\" Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1528 (quoting Union Carbide Corp. v.

      "In 1979, the Zannons purchased the right to publish Freebies Magazine, a periodical providing information about free mail-order offerings. The Zannons also acquired ownership rights to the stylized trademark FREEBIES, which the previous publisher registered in 1978 to use as a logo for the magazine. Apparently, the Zannons abandoned this particular mark for a period of time beginning in June 1985; however, in March 1992, the Zannons filed an application, on behalf of Freebies Publishing, with the PTO for a new certificate of registration for a different rendition of the stylized FREEBIES mark. Although the PTO eventually issued a certificate of registration for the mark, the application process was not without difficulty.

RSI refused to do so, believing the word \"freebies\" to be generic in nature, not entitled to trademark protection, and free for public use. Defendants initiated an arbitration proceeding against RSI pursuant to the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (\"UDRP\"), which is incorporated into all domain-name registration agreements pursuant to which a second-level domain name is issued to a member of the public. The UDRP requires the registrant to submit disputes concerning the domain name to an approved dispute resolution provider — in this case the National Arbitration Forum — for the purpose of what is essentially non-binding arbitration. See Dluhos v. Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 372-73 (3d Cir.2003) (\"UDRP proceedings do not fall under the Federal Arbitration Act... [and] judicial review of those decisions is not restricted to a motion to vacate arbitration award under § 10 of the FAA, which applies only to binding proceedings likely to `realistically settle the dispute.'\"). The arbitrator concluded that <freebie.com> was confusingly similar to defendants' registered trademark and that RSI had no trademark rights in the name freebie. Additionally, the arbitrator determined that RSI registered the domain name in bad faith because it used the plural term \"freebies\" as a metatag for its website, which directed an Internet search for \"freebies\" to RSI's site.1 The arbitrator was persuaded that this evidence demonstrated RSI's awareness of defendants' FREEBIES trademark and, therefore, bad faith in acquiring its domain name.

The court rejected the same argument defendants now offer on appeal — that summary judgment was inappropriate because an issue of fact existed by virtue of the PTO's registration of the FREEBIES mark, which is prima facie evidence that the mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection. Defendants also argued unsuccessfully that, even though use of the word \"freebie\" is now widespread, the FREEBIES mark was entitled to protection because the defendants did not use the word in the generic sense.

      "Under the Lanham Act, the issuance of a certificate of registration arms the registrant with \"prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the registrant's ownership of the mark, and of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1057(b) (West 1997). Because the PTO may not register a generic mark, the fact that a mark is registered is strong evidence that the mark satisfies the statutory requirements for the distinctiveness necessary for trademark protection. See 15 U.S.C.A. §§ 1052(e), 1057(b); 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3) (West 1997). The certificate of registration supplies \"the registrant [with] ... prima facie evidence that its mark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public ... and that its mark ... at a minimum is descriptive and has obtained secondary meaning.\" America Online, Inc. v. AT & T Corp., 243 F.3d 812, 816 (4th Cir.2001); see U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 524. This is a significant procedural advantage for the registrant. Without a certificate of registration, the owner would be required to establish that the disputed mark was sufficiently distinctive to warrant trademark protection in the first place. See Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. The effect of the presumption is to satisfy that burden in the absence of rebutting evidence. See America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; see also Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d 778, 783 (9th Cir.2002) (\"In trademark terms, the registration is not absolute but subject to rebuttal\" and \"discharges the plaintiff's original common law burden of proving validity in an infringement action.\").\n",

See Glover v. Ampak, Inc., 74 F.3d 57, 59 (4th Cir.1996); Pizzeria Uno, 747 F.2d at 1529. The burden shifted by the presumption is one of production rather than persuasion. See Fed.R.Evid. 301 (\"In all civil actions and proceedings not otherwise provided for by Act of Congress or by these rules, a presumption imposes on the party against whom it is directed the burden of going forward with evidence to rebut or meet the presumption, but does not shift to such party the burden of proof in the sense of the risk of nonpersuasion, which remains throughout the trial upon the party on whom it was originally cast.\"). If sufficient evidence of genericness is produced to rebut the presumption, the presumption is \"neutralize[d]\" and essentially drops from the case, although the evidence giving rise to the presumption remains. America Online, 243 F.3d at 818; cf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 143, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000) (\"[A]lthough the presumption of discrimination `drops out of the picture' once the defendant meets its burden of production ... the trier of fact may still consider the evidence establishing the plaintiff's prima facie case....\").\n",

      "In America Online, we considered the question of whether, in a federal trademark infringement action, a district court should afford Chevron-type deference to the PTO's determination that a given mark is registrable (and, by definition, not generic). In rejecting the application of Chevron deference, we explained that the PTO's \"decision to register a mark, without requiring evidence of secondary meaning, [is] powerful evidence that the registered mark is suggestive\" and that a district court should \"receiv[e] the certificate of registration ... into evidence and treat [it] as prima facie evidence of the validity of the mark.\" 243 F.3d at 817-18. Although we concluded that \"the prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration was in this case sufficient to establish a question of material fact that could not be resolved on summary judgment,\" id. at 818, we nowhere suggested that registration created a per se issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment. The panel in America Online carefully noted that the registration was sufficient \"in this case\" to preclude summary judgment, and that, in addition to the certificate of registration, there was \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. Id. at 818 (first emphasis added).2 The latter observation, of course, would be pointless if, as defendants argue, America Online held that a certificate of registration alone settles the matter of summary judgment. At most, America Online suggests that, as a general rule, the introduction of a certificate of registration will create enough of an factual dispute to render summary judgment inappropriate on the basis that the mark is generic. See U.S. Search, 300 F.3d at 524 (\"The prima facie evidence provided by the certificate of registration is generally sufficient to establish a question of material fact that cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\").

First, defendants point out that in reviewing defendants' application for trademark registration, the PTO's examining attorney considered one of the same dictionary definitions of \"freebie\" that the district court found persuasive on the issue of genericness. Defendants argue the fact that the PTO ultimately issued the certificate of registration seriously undercuts the value of the dictionary definition. This is not additional evidence; it is part and parcel of the certificate of registration which, as we explained at length, is itself evidence the word or phrase in question is not generic. We fail to see how this part of the registration process offers anything that the whole does not. The district court, of course, took the registration into account and acknowledged its presumptive effect, but simply concluded it was not enough to prevent summary judgment for RSI.

      "39\n",
      "Defendants also contend that the district court all but ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the registered term was not only not generic, but was a strong, commercially successful mark with a well-established secondary meaning. In particular, defendants high-light that <freebies.com> receives an average of \"100,000 visits per month from consumers around the world,\" J.A. 712; that Freebies Magazine in print form had millions of paying subscribers; and that defendants sold more than 385,000 books offering information similar to that provided in Freebies Magazine. Evidence of an acquired secondary meaning, however, has no relevance unless the mark in question has been found not to be generic. See, e.g., Home Builders Ass'n of Greater St. Louis v. L & L Exhibition Mgmt., Inc., 226 F.3d 944, 949 (8th Cir.2000) (\"A `generic' mark is the common name of a product or service....

Evidence establishing a likelihood of confusion simply \"do[es] not bear upon the question of whether [a] trademark ... [is] generic.\" Ale House Mgmt., Inc. v. Raleigh Ale House, Inc., 205 F.3d 137, 144-45 (4th Cir.2000).

Defendants emphasize that they do not actually distribute or offer the free products or samples, which they concede would constitute a generic use of \"freebies,\" but simply tell consumers how to obtain such items from others, which they claim does not.

Of course, it is certainly possible for a term to serve as a generic description for one category of products but function as a distinctive mark for unrelated products in a different context. See, e.g., In re Seats, Inc., 757 F.2d 274, 277 (Fed.Cir.1985) (holding that the word \"SEATS\" was not generic for ticket reservations services even though it could not be registered in connection with chairs or couches). Even though defendants do not directly distribute free products or \"freebies,\" their business nonetheless revolves around \"freebies\" in the generic sense of the word. As defendants' website proclaims, they are \"BRINGING YOU THE BEST FREE AND ALMOST FREE OFFERS SINCE 1977!\"5 J.A. 1382. Accordingly, we reject defendants' contention that they were not using the term in its generic sense.\n",

      "Defendants suggest that, even if we do not agree that FREEBIES is, at the very least, a descriptive mark that has acquired secondary meaning, it is beyond dispute that FREEBIES has become incontestable, and therefore is not subject to challenge with regard to its secondary meaning. This argument misses the mark.\n",

      "If a registered trademark becomes incontestable, the rebuttable presumption that a registered mark has acquired secondary meaning becomes \"conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the registered mark\" subject to a number of affirmative defenses enumerated in the Lanham Act. 15 U.S.C.A § 1115(b) (West 1998 & Supp.2003). This list, however, does not include a defense based upon a mark's lack of secondary meaning — a merely descriptive mark, then, is subject to challenge based on its lack of distinctiveness until it acquires incontestable status. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. Thus, a presumption arises from the registration of a trademark that the mark is entitled to trademark protection because of either the mark's inherently distinctive nature or its secondary meaning, but the mark is subject to challenge on the basis that it is merely descriptive. See id.; America Online, 243 F.3d at 817-18. The validity of the same registered mark, after qualifying for incontestable status, is conclusively presumed and may not be challenged as merely descriptive. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 196, 105 S.Ct. 658. The Supreme Court provided this concise summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "A mark that is merely descriptive of an applicant's goods or services is not registrable unless the mark has secondary meaning. Before a mark achieves incontestable status, registration provides prima facie evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark in commerce. The Lanham Act expressly provides that before a mark becomes incontestable an opposing party may prove any ... defense which might have been asserted if the mark had not been registered ... [including a] challenge [to the] mark as merely descriptive.... With respect to incontestable marks, ... registration is conclusive evidence of the registrant's exclusive right to use the mark.... Mere descriptiveness is not recognized by [the relevant provisions of the Lanham Act] as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark.\n",

      "Here, however, the issue is not whether the mark is merely descriptive, but whether it is generic. And incontestability is never a shield for a mark that is generic. Although § 1115(b) does not enumerate the generic nature of a trademark as a basis for challenging an incontestable mark, a registration is subject to cancellation at any time \"if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services ... for which it is registered.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1064(3). As we observed before, a generic word can never function as a trademark or receive a certificate of registration as one. Even an incontestable mark, therefore, comes within the reach of § 1064(3) and may be canceled if it becomes generic. See Park `N Fly, 469 U.S. at 195, 105 S.Ct. 658.\n",

      "Finally, defendants contend that, separate and apart from their rights in the word FREEBIES, the stylized rendering of the letters is sufficiently distinctive to merit registration. Assuming the registered display of FREEBIES is distinctive (which is far from clear), that fact does not aid defendants — \"such a registration does not give any exclusive right to use the generic word per se\" — \"[t]he only exclusive right from such a `picture' registration is the use of that exact `picture' which happens to spell out a generic name.\" 2 McCarthy at § 12:40 (citing Time, Inc. v. Petersen Pub. Co., 173 F.3d 113 (2nd Cir.1999)). We have no difficulty concluding that the modest stylized lettering of the FREEBIES mark in no way affords defendants ownership rights in the generic word \"freebies.\" And, defendants do not guide us to anything in the record to suggest that the stylized rendition of the word is \"so distinctive as to create a commercial impression separate and apart from the [generic] term.\" In re Northland Aluminum Prods., Inc., 777 F.2d 1556, 1561 (Fed.Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).

      "Under the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA), the owner of a protected mark has a cause of action \"against anyone who registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to [the owner's] trademark with the bad faith intent to profit from the good will associated with the trademark.\" Hawes v. Network Solutions, Inc., 337 F.3d 377, 383 (4th Cir.2003); see 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1). The district court concluded that because it \"found defendants' trademark ineligible for protection, there can be no ACPA violation.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 827. Nevertheless, the court also analyzed whether RSI had violated the ACPA as if the FREEBIES mark were not generic, concluding that \"there was insufficient evidence... in this record to sustain a finding that [RSI] registered the domain name in bad faith.\" Id. at 828. We need go no farther than the district court's initial conclusion that defendants cannot state a claim under the ACPA without a valid trademark. This conclusion is compelled from the statutory language.\n",
      "\n",

      "51\n",
      "In pertinent part, the ACPA provides that \"[a] person shall be liable in a civil action by the owner of a mark,... if, without regard to the goods or services of the parties, that person ... (i) has a bad faith intent to profit from that mark ... and (ii) registers, traffics in, or uses a domain name that ... is identical or confusingly similar to that mark.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1125(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). Under the statute, the term \"mark\" includes \"trademark,\" which is defined as \"identify[ing] and distinguish[ing] [the owner's] goods ... from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods.\" 15 U.S.C.A. § 1127. As we noted before, a generic term cannot function as a trademark; in fact, to say \"generic mark\" is to utter an oxymoron. \"By definition, something that is generic cannot serve as a trademark because it cannot function as an indication of source.\" Sunrise Jewelry Mfg. Corp. v. Fred S.A., 175 F.3d 1322, 1325 (Fed.Cir.1999). Thus, a prerequisite for bringing a claim under the ACPA is establishing the existence of a valid trademark and ownership of that mark. As we have already determined that \"freebies\" is generic and not entitled to trademark protection, defendants cannot surmount this threshold barrier. We therefore affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment against defendants on their cybersquatting counterclaim, and its declaration that RSI's \"use of the domain name www.freebie.com does not violate the Anti-Cybersquatting Consumer Protection Act.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.\n",

RSI asserted this claim in its complaint for declaratory relief; it has not yet filed a separate motion for fees and did not seek a ruling on costs and fees as part of its summary judgment motion. Nevertheless, the district court disposed of this question sua sponte, without the benefit of briefing or oral argument. The court held that the case did not satisfy the \"exceptional\" requirement for an award of fees, 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a), and that an award of costs was inappropriate as well because \"no violation of a registered trademark has been established.\" Retail Servs., 247 F.Supp.2d at 829.

We depart from a number of other courts, however, once the analysis moves beyond the general definition of an \"exceptional case.\" This circuit imposes a dual standard of proof upon prevailing plaintiffs and defendants. A prevailing plaintiff seeking attorney fees must demonstrate \"that the defendant acted in bad faith.\" Scotch Whisky Ass'n v. Majestic Distilling Co., 958 F.2d 594, 599 (4th Cir.1992); PETA, 263 F.3d at 370.6 However, when an alleged infringer is the prevailing party, he can qualify for an award of attorney fees upon a showing of \"something less than bad faith\" by the plaintiff. Scotch Whisky, 958 F.2d at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted); accord Noxell Corp. v. Firehouse No. 1 Bar-B-Que Restaurant, 771 F.2d 521, 526 (1985).7 Some pertinent considerations for judging a plaintiff's (or counterclaim plaintiff's) conduct when the defendant prevails include \"economic coercion, groundless arguments, and failure to cite controlling law.\" Ale House Mgmt., 205 F.3d at 144 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).

RSI does not challenge the conclusion that defendants had a subjective, good faith belief that their trademark claims were viable.

      "The question, however, is not whether snippets of the record or isolated arguments clearly lack merit.

We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in concluding that this is not an \"exceptional case\" within the meaning of 15 U.S.C.A. § 1117(a). Moreover, we see nothing in the district court's order to indicate that it ignored the objective aspect of the positions taken by defendants during this case. Furthermore, although it may have been preferable for the district court to solicit input from the parties at a separate hearing on this issue, RSI could have sought to alter or amend the judgment on the question of attorney fees under Rule 59(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which also may have resulted in a more detailed analysis from the district court. RSI chose not to do so, an understandable tactical choice in light of the fact it had just achieved an unqualified victory on the merits. In this case, we will not disturb the district court's decision, which is also the correct one, solely because it was entered sua sponte when RSI opted not to seize its opportunity to raise its concerns below via Rule 59(e).

      "A general court-martial found petitioner Loving, an Army private, guilty  of both premeditated murder and felony murder under Article 118 of the  Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 918(1),  (4). Finding three aggravating factors-(1) that the premeditated murder  was committed during a robbery, Rule for Courts-Martial (RCM)  the premeditated murder, had committed a second murder, also proved at  his single trial, RCM 1004(c)(7)(J)-the court-martial sentenced Loving  to death. The commander who convened the court-martial approved the findings and sentence.  The United States Army Court of Military Review  and the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces affirmed,  rejecting Loving's attack on the promulgation by Executive Order of the  aggravating factors in RCM 1004.  He contends that the Eighth Amendment  and the separation-of-powers doctrine require that Congress, not the  President, make the fundamental policy determination respecting the  factors that warrant the death penalty.\n",
      "Held:\n",
      "1.  On the assumption that Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238, and  subsequent cases apply to this crime and sentence, the Constitution  requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges.  Under the  Eighth Amendment, the military capital sentencing scheme must genuinely  narrow the class of persons eligible for the death penalty and must  reasonably justify the imposition of a more severe sentence on the  accused compared to others found guilty of murder, see, e.g., Lowenfield  v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244.  That narrowing is not achieved in the statute.  Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the  four types of murder therein specified, premeditated and felony murder,  Section(s) 918(1), (4), whereas intentional murder without premeditation  and murder resulting from wanton and dangerous conduct are not  punishable by death, Section(s) 918(2), (3).  Moreover, Article 118(4)  by its terms permits the death penalty for felony murder even if the  accused had no intent to kill and did not do the killing himself.  Because the Eighth Amendment does not permit death to be imposed in  those circumstances, Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801, additional aggravating factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to  Article 118's constitutional validity, see, e.g., Lowenfield, supra, at  244.  Pp. 5-6.\n",
      "2.  The President's prescription of the challenged aggravating factors  did not violate the separation-of-powers principle.  Pp. 6-25.\n",
      "(a) The fundamental precept of the delegation doctrine, a strand of this  Court's separation-of-powers jurisprudence, is that the lawmaking  function belongs to Congress, U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 1, and  may not be conveyed to another branch or entity, Field v. Clark, 143 U.  S. 649, 692.  This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress  can make a rule of prospective force.  Although it may not delegate the  power to make the law, which necessarily involves discretion as to what the law shall be, Congress may delegate to others the authority or discretion to execute the law under and in pursuance of its terms. Id.,  at 693-694. Pp. 6-10.\n",
      "(b)  The Court rejects Loving's argument that Congress lacks power to  delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating factors  in capital murder cases.  An analysis of English constitutional history  and of the historical necessities and events that instructed the Framers  demonstrates that U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 8, cl. 14-which  empowers Congress \"[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of  the land and naval forces\"-does not grant an exclusive, nondelegable  power to determine military punishments, but gives Congress such flexibility to exercise or share power as the times might demand. And  it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander in  Chief to hold that he may not be given wide discretion and authority.  Thus, in the circumstances presented here, Congress may delegate  authority to the President to define the aggravating factors that permit  imposition of a statutory penalty, with the regulations providing the  narrowing of the death-eligible class that the Eighth Amendment  requires.  Pp. 10-19.\n",
      "(c) Also rejected is Loving's contention that, even if Congress can delegate to the President the authority to prescribe aggravating  factors, Congress did not do so by implicit or explicit action in this  instance.  In fact, Congress exercised that power of delegation in 1950,  when it enacted Articles 18, 56, and 36(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C.  Section(s) 818 (A court-martial \"may, under such limitations as the  President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the  UCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically authorized\"), 856 (\"The punishment which a court-martial may direct . . . may not  exceed such limits as the President may prescribe for that offense\"),  and 836(a) (which empowers the President to make procedural rules for  courtsmartial, and was identified by Congress in 1985 as a source of  Presidential authority to provide capital aggravating factors).  Together, these Articles give clear authority to the President to  promulgate RCM 1004.  Pp. 20-22.\n",
      "(d) Loving's final assertion-that even if Articles 18, 56, and 36 can be  construed as delegations, they lack an intelligible principle to guide  the President's discretion-is also rejected. Had the delegations here  called for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the  President's traditional authority, this argument might have more weight.  However, because the President's duties as Commander in Chief require  him to take responsible and continuing action to superintend the  military, including the courts-martial, the delegated duty to prescribe aggravating factors for capital cases is interlinked with duties already  assigned to him by the Constitution's express terms.  The same  limitations on delegation do not apply where the entity exercising the  delegated authority possesses independent authority over the subject  matter.  See, e.g., United States v. Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557.  Pp. 22-25.\n",

      "Although American courts-martial from their inception have had  the power to decree capital punishment, they have not long had the  authority to try and to sentence members of the armed forces for capital  murder committed in the United States in peacetime.  In the early days  of the Republic the powers of courts-martial were fixed in the Articles  of War. Congress enacted the first Articles in 1789 by adopting in full  the Articles promulgated in 1775 (and revised in 1776) by the Continental Congress.  Act of Sept. 29, 1789, ch. 25, Section(s) 4, 1  Stat. 96.  (Congress reenacted the Articles in 1790 \"as far as the same  may be applicable to the constitution of the United States,\" Act of Apr.  30, 1790, ch. 10, Section(s) 13, 1 Stat. 121).  The Articles adopted by  the First Congress placed significant restrictions on court-martial  jurisdiction over capital offenses.  Although the death penalty was  authorized for 14 military offenses, American Articles of War of 1776,  reprinted in W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 961 (reprint 2d  ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop); Allred, Comment, Rocks and Shoals in a  Sea of Otherwise Deep Commitment: General Court-Martial Size and Voting  Requirements, 35 Nav. L. Rev. 153, 156-158 (1986), the Articles followed  the British example of ensuring the supremacy of civil court  jurisdiction over ordinary capital crimes that were punishable by the  law of the land and were not special military offenses.  1776 Articles,  Section(s) 10, Art. 1, reprinted in Winthrop 964 (requiring commanders,  upon application, to exert utmost effort to turn offender over to civil authorities).  Cf. British Articles of War of 1765, Section(s) 11, Art.  1, reprinted in Winthrop 937 (same). That provision was deemed  protection enough for soldiers, and in 1806 Congress debated and  rejected a proposal to remove the death penalty from court-martial  jurisdiction.

      "Over the next two centuries, Congress expanded court-martial jurisdiction.  In 1863, concerned that civil courts could not function  in all places during hostilities, Congress granted courts-martial  jurisdiction of common-law capital crimes and the authority to impose  the death penalty in wartime.  Act of Mar. 3, 1863, Section(s) 30, 12  Stat. 736, Rev. Stat. Section(s) 1342, Art. 58 (1875); Coleman v.  Tennessee, 97 U. S. 509, 514 (1879). In 1916, Congress granted to the  military courts a general jurisdiction over common-law felonies  committed by service members, except for murder and rape committed  within the continental United States during peacetime.  Articles of War  of 1916, ch. 418, Section(s) 3, Arts. 92-93, 39 Stat. 664.  Persons accused of the latter two crimes were to be turned over to the civilian  authorities.  Art. 74, 39 Stat. 662.  In 1950, with the passage of the  UCMJ, Congress lifted even this restriction. Article 118 of the UCMJ  describes four types of murder subject to court-martial jurisdiction,  two of which are punishable by death:\n",

      "So matters stood until 1983, when the CMA confronted a challenge  to the constitutionality of the military capital punishment scheme in  light of Furman v. Georgia, 408 U. S. 238 (1972), and our ensuing death  penalty jurisprudence.  Although it held valid most of the death penalty  procedures followed in courts-martial, the court found one fundamental  defect: the failure of either the UCMJ or the RCM to require that court-martial members \"specifically identify the aggravating factors  upon which they have relied in choosing to impose the death penalty.\"  United States v. Matthews, 16 M. J. 354, 379. The Court reversed  Matthews' death sentence, but ruled that either Congress or the  President could remedy the defect and that the new procedures could be  applied retroactively.  16 M. J., at 380-382.\n",

      "The President responded to Matthews in 1984 with an Executive Order promulgating RCM 1004.  In conformity with 10 U. S. C. Section(s)  852(a)(1), the Rule, as amended, requires a unanimous finding that the  accused was guilty of a capital offense before a death sentence may be  imposed, RCM 1004(a)(2).  The Rule also requires unanimous findings (1)  that at least one  aggravating factor is present and (2) that any  extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighed by  any admissible aggravating circumstances, 1004(b).  RCM 1004(c)  enumerates 11 categories of aggravating factors sufficient for  imposition of the death penalty.  The Rule also provides that the  accused is to have \"broad latitude to present evidence in extenuation  and mitigation,\" 1004(b)(3), and is entitled to have the members of the  court-martial instructed to consider all such evidence before deciding  upon a death sentence, 1004(b)(6).\n",

      "This is the scheme Loving attacks as unconstitutional.  He contends that the Eighth Amendment and the doctrine of separation of  powers require that Congress, and not the President, make the fundamental policy determination respecting the factors that warrant the  death penalty.\n",

      "III.\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "A preliminary question in this case is whether the Constitution  requires the aggravating factors that Loving challenges.  The Government  does not contest the application of our death penalty jurisprudence to  courts-martial, at least in the context of a conviction under Article  118 for murder committed in peacetime within the United States, and we  shall assume that Furman and the case law resulting from it are applicable to the crime and sentence in question.  Cf. Trop v. Dulles,  356 U. S. 86 (1958) (analyzing court-martial punishments under the  Eighth Amendment).  The Eighth Amendment requires, among other things,  that \"a capital sentencing scheme must `genuinely narrow the class of  persons eligible for the death penalty and must reasonably justify the  imposition of a more severe sentence on the defendant compared to others  found guilty of murder.'\"  Lowenfield v. Phelps, 484 U. S. 231, 244 (1988) (quoting Zant v. Stephens, 462 U. S. 862, 877 (1983)).  Some schemes accomplish that narrowing by requiring that the sentencer find  at least one aggravating circumstance.  Ibid.  The narrowing may also be  achieved, however, in the definition of the capital offense, in which  circumstance the requirement that the sentencer \"find the existence of  an aggravating circumstance in addition is no part of the  constitutionally required narrowing process.\" Id., at 246.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "15\n",
      "Although the Government suggests the contrary, Brief for United  States 11, n. 6, we agree with Loving, on the assumption that Furman  applies to this case, that aggravating factors are necessary to the  constitutional validity of the military capital-punishment scheme as now  enacted. Article 118 authorizes the death penalty for but two of the  four types of murder specified: premeditated and felony murder are  punishable by death, 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 918(1), (4), whereas  intentional murder without premeditation and murder resulting from  wanton and dangerous conduct are not, Section(s) 918(2), (3).  The  statute's selection of the two types of murder for the death penalty, however, does not narrow the death-eligible class in a way consistent  with our cases.  Article 118(4) by its terms permits death to be imposed  for felony murder even if the accused had no intent to kill and even if  he did not do the killing himself. The Eighth Amendment does not permit  the death penalty to be imposed in those circumstances.  Enmund v. Florida, 458 U. S. 782, 801 (1982).  As a result, additional aggravating  factors establishing a higher culpability are necessary to save Article  118.  We turn to the question whether it violated the principle of  separation of powers for the President to prescribe the aggravating  factors required by the Eighth Amendment.\n",

Article I's precise rules of representation,  member qualifications, bicameralism, and voting procedure make Congress  the branch most capable of responsive and deliberative lawmaking.  See  Chadha, supra, at 951.  Ill suited to that task are the Presidency,  designed for the prompt and faithful execution of the laws and its own  legitimate powers, and the Judiciary, a branch with tenure and authority  independent of direct electoral control.

      "Another strand of our separation-of-powers jurisprudence, the delegation doctrine, has developed to prevent Congress from forsaking  its duties.  Loving invokes this doctrine to question the authority of  the President to promulgate RCM 1004.  The fundamental precept of the  delegation doctrine is that the lawmaking function belongs to Congress,  U. S. Const., Art. I, Section(s) 1, and may not be conveyed to another  branch or entity.  Field v. Clark, 143 U. S. 649, 692 (1892).  This principle does not mean, however, that only Congress can make a rule of  prospective force.  To burden Congress with all federal rulemaking would  divert that branch from more pressing issues, and defeat the Framers'  design of a workable National Government. Thomas Jefferson observed,  \"Nothing is so embarrassing nor so mischievous in a great assembly as  the details of execution.\"  5 Works of Thomas Jefferson 319 (P. Ford ed.  1904) (Letter to E. Carrington, Aug. 4, 1787).  See also A. L. A.  Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495, 529-530 (1935) (recognizing \"the necessity of adapting legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the national legislature cannot deal directly\").

He presses his constitutional challenge on three fronts.  First, he argues that Congress cannot delegate to the President the  authority to prescribe aggravating factors in capital murder cases.  Second, he contends that, even if it can, Congress did not delegate the  authority by implicit or explicit action.  Third, Loving believes that  even if certain statutory provisions can be construed as delegations,  they lack an intelligible principle to guide the President's discretion.  Were Loving's premises to be accepted, the President would lack authority to prescribe aggravating factors in RCM 1004, and the death  sentence imposed upon him would be unconstitutional.\n",

      "Loving's first argument is that Congress lacks power to allow the President to prescribe aggravating factors in military capital cases  because any delegation would be inconsistent with the Framers' decision  to vest in Congress the power \"To make Rules for the Government and  Regulation of the land and naval forces.\" U. S. Const., Art. I,  Section(s) 8, cl. 14.  At least in the context of capital punishment for  peacetime crimes, which implicates the Eighth Amendment, this power must  be deemed exclusive, Loving contends.  In his view, not only is the determination of aggravating factors a quintessential policy judgment  for the legislature, but the history of military capital punishment in  England and America refutes a contrary interpretation.  He asserts that  his offense was not tried in a military court throughout most of English  and American history. It is this historical exclusion of common-law  capital crimes from military jurisdiction, he urges, which must inform  our understanding of whether Clause 14 reserves to Congress the power to  prescribe what conduct warrants a death sentence, even if it permits  Congress to authorize courts-martial to try such crimes. See Brief for  Petitioner 42-43; Brief for United States Navy-Marine Corps Appellate  Defense Division as Amicus Curiae 7-12, 19-26.  Mindful of the  historical dangers of autocratic military justice and of the limits  Parliament set on the peacetime jurisdiction of courts-martial over  capital crimes in the first Mutiny Act, 1 Wm. & Mary, ch. 5 (1689), and  having experienced the military excesses of the Crown in colonial  America, the Framers harbored a deep distrust of executive military  power and military tribunals.  See Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-24 (1957) (plurality); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228, 232 (1959).  It follows, Loving says, that the Framers intended that Congress alone  should possess the power to decide what aggravating factors justify  sentencing a member of the armed forces to death.\n",

      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "We have undertaken before, in resolving other issues, the difficult task of interpreting Clause 14 by drawing upon English constitutional history.  See, e.g., Reid, supra, at 23-30; O'Callahan v.  Parker, 395 U. S. 258, 268-272 (1969) (determining that courts-martial  only had jurisdiction of service-connected crimes); Solorio v. United  States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987) (overruling O'Callahan and taking  issue with its historical analysis).  Doing so here, we find that,  although there is a grain of truth in Loving's historical arguments, the  struggle of Parliament to control military tribunals and the lessons the Framers drew from it are more complex than he suggests.  The history  does not require us to read Clause 14 as granting to Congress an  exclusive, nondelegable power to determine military punishments.  If  anything, it appears that England found security in divided authority,  with Parliament at times ceding to the Crown the task of fixing military  punishments.  From the English experience the Framers understood the  necessity of balancing efficient military discipline, popular control of  a standing army, and the rights of soldiers; they perceived the risks inherent in assigning the task to one part of the government to the  exclusion of another; and they knew the resulting parliamentary practice  of delegation.  The Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress  the same flexibility to exercise or share power as times might demand.\n",

The rudiments of law in English military  justice can first be seen in the written orders issued by the King for  various expeditions.  Winthrop 17-18.  For example, in 1190 Richard I  issued an ordinance outlining six offenses to which the crusaders would  be subject, including two punishable by death: \"Whoever shall slay a man  on ship-board, he shall be bound to the dead man and thrown into the  sea. If he shall slay him on land he shall be bound to the dead man and buried in the earth.\"  Ordinance of Richard I-A.D. 1190, reprinted in  id., at 903.  The first comprehensive articles of war were those  declared by Richard II at Durham in 1385 and Henry V at Mantes in 1419,  which decreed capital offenses that not only served military discipline  but also protected foreign noncombatants from the ravages of war.

Articles of War, sometimes issued by military commanders acting under royal commission in the ensuing centuries, Winthrop 19, were not fixed codes, at least through  the 17th century; rather, \"each war, each expedition, had its own  edict,\" which lost force after the cessation of hostilities and the  disbanding of the army that had been formed.

Military justice was brought  under the rule of parliamentary law in 1689, when William and Mary  accepted the Bill of Rights requiring Parliament's consent to the  raising and keeping of armies.  In the Mutiny Act of 1689, Parliament declared the general principle that \"noe Man may be forejudged of Life  or Limbe or subjected to any kinde of punishment by Martiall Law or in  any other manner then by the Judgment of his Peeres and according to the  knowne and Established Laws of this Realme,\" but decreed that \"Soldiers  who shall Mutiny or stirr up Sedition or shall desert Their Majestyes  Service be brought to a more Exemplary and speedy Punishment than the  usuall Forms of Law will allow,\" and \"shall suffer Death or such other  Punishment as by a Court-Martiall shall be Inflicted.\" 1 Wm.

A strong line of demarcation  must therefore be drawn between the soldiers and the rest of the  community.

The third of the Mutiny Acts of 1715  subjected the soldier to capital punishment for a wide array of  peacetime offenses related to political disorder and troop discipline.  Id., at 50. And, for a short time in the 18th century, Parliament  allowed the Crown to invest courts-martial with a general criminal jurisdiction over soldiers even at home, placing no substantive limit on  the penalties that could be imposed; until 1718, that jurisdiction was  superior to civil courts.  Id., at 52-53.  The propriety of that general  jurisdiction within the kingdom was questioned, and the jurisdiction was  withdrawn in 1749.  Id., at 53. Nevertheless, even as it continued to  adjust the scope of military jurisdiction at home, Parliament entrusted  broad powers to the Crown to define and punish military crimes abroad.  In 1713, it gave statutory sanction to the Crown's longstanding practice  of issuing Articles of War without limiting the kind of punishments that  might be imposed; and, in the same Act, it delegated the power to \"erect  and constitute Courts Martial with Power to try hear and determine any  Crime or Offence by such Articles of War  and inflict Penalties by  Sentence or Judgement in any of Her Majesties Dominions beyond the Seas  or elsewhere beyond the Seas (except in the Kingdom of Ireland) . . . as  might have been done by Her Majesties Authority beyond the Seas in Time of War.\"  12 Anne, ch. 13, Section(s) 43; Winthrop 20.  Cf. Duke & Vogel, supra, at 444 (noting that Parliament in 1803 gave statutory  authority to the Crown to promulgate Articles of War applicable to  troops stationed in England as well).

      "As Loving contends, and as we have explained elsewhere, the Framers well knew this history, and had encountered firsthand the abuses  of military law in the colonies.  See Reid, 354 U. S., at 27-28.  As  many were themselves veterans of the Revolutionary War, however, they  also knew the imperatives of military discipline.  What they distrusted  were not courts-martial per se, but military justice dispensed by a  commander unchecked by the civil power in proceedings so summary as to  be lawless. The latter was the evil that caused Blackstone to declare  that \"martial law\" -- by which he, not observing the modern distinction between military and martial law, meant decrees of courts-martial disciplining soldiers in wartime -- \"is built upon no settled principles, but is entirely arbitrary in its decisions, [and] is, as Sir  Matthew Hale observes, in truth and reality no law, but something  indulged rather than allowed as a law.\"  1 Blackstone's Commentaries  *413.  See also Hale, History of the Common Law of England, at 26-27;  Clode 21 (military law in early seventeenth century England amounted to  \"the arbitrary right to punish or destroy, without legal trial, any  assumed delinquent\").  The partial security Englishmen won against such  abuse in 1689 was to give Parliament, preeminent guardian of the British  constitution, primacy in matters of military law.  This fact does not  suggest, however, that a legislature's power must be exclusive.  It was for Parliament, as it did in the various Mutiny Acts, to designate as  the times required what peacetime offenses by soldiers deserved the  punishment of death; and it was for Parliament, as it did in 1713, to  delegate the authority to define wartime offenses and devise their  punishments, including death.  The Crown received the delegated power  and the concomitant responsibility for its prudent exercise.  The lesson  from the English constitutional experience was that Parliament must have the primary power to regulate the armed forces and to determine the  punishments that could be imposed upon soldiers by courts-martial.  That  was not inconsistent, however, with the further power to divide  authority between it and the Crown as conditions might warrant.\n",

This power is no less plenary than other Article I powers,  Solorio, supra, at 441, and we discern no reasons why Congress should  have less capacity to make measured and appropriate delegations of this  power than of any other, see Skinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.  S. 212, 220-221 (1989) (Congress may delegate authority under the taxing  power); cf. Lichter v. United States, 334 U.

Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981).  And it would be contrary to the respect owed the President as Commander in Chief to hold  that he may not be given wide discretion and authority.

Solorio, supra, at 450-451 (Congress may extend court-martial  jurisdiction to any criminal offense committed by a service member  during his period of service).  It further declared the law that service  members who commit premeditated and felony murder may be sentenced to  death by a court-martial.

      "Having held that Congress has the power of delegation, we further hold that it exercised the power in Articles 18 and 56 of the  UCMJ.  Article 56 specifies that \"[t]he punishment which a court-martial  may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as the President  may prescribe for that offense.\"  10 U. S. C. Section(s) 856.  Article  18 states that a court-martial \"may, under such limitations as the  President may prescribe, adjudge any punishment not forbidden by [the  UCMJ], including the penalty of death when specifically authorized by\"  the Code. Section(s) 818.  As the Court of Military Appeals pointed out  in Curtis, for some decades the President has used his authority under  these Articles to increase the penalties for certain noncapital offenses  if aggravating circumstances are present. For example, by regulation,  deserters who are apprehended are punished more severely than those who  surrender; drunk drivers suffer a harsher fate if they cause an accident  resulting in the death of a victim; and the punishment of thieves is  graded by the value of the stolen goods.  See Curtis, 32 M. J., at 261.  The President has thus provided more precision in sentencing than is provided by the statute, while remaining within statutory bounds. This  past practice suggests that Articles 18 and 56 support as well an  authority in the President to restrict the death sentence to murders in  which certain aggravating circumstances have been established.\n",

      "Although the language of Article 36 seems further afield from capital aggravating factors than that of Article 18 or 56, it is the  provision that a later Congress identified as the source of Presidential  authority to prescribe these factors.  In 1985, Congress enacted Article  106(a) of the UCMJ, 10 U. S. C. Section(s) 906a, which authorized the  death penalty for espionage.  The Article requires a finding of an  aggravating factor if the accused is to be sentenced to death; it  enumerates three such factors, but allows death to be decreed on \"[a]ny other factor that may be prescribed by the President by regulations  under section 836 of this title (article 36).\" Section(s) 906(a)(c)(4).  Article 106a itself, then, is premised on the President's having  authority under Article 36 to prescribe capital aggravating factors, and  \"`[s]ubsequent legislation declaring the intent of an earlier statute is  entitled to great weight in statutory construction.'\"  Consumer Product  Safety Comm'n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U. S. 102, 118, n. 13 (1980),  quoting Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U. S. 367, 380-381 (1969).

In  1950, he argues, Congress could not have understood that it was giving  the President the authority to bring an otherwise invalid capital murder  statute in line with Eighth Amendment strictures.  Perhaps so, but  Furman did not somehow undo the prior delegation.  What would have been an act of leniency by the President prior to Furman may have become a  constitutional necessity thereafter, see supra, at 5-6, but the fact  remains the power to prescribe aggravating circumstances has resided  with the President since 1950.\n",

United States, 276 U. S. 394, 409 (1928); Touby, 500 U. S., at  165.  The intelligible-principle rule seeks to enforce the understanding that Congress  may not delegate the power to make laws and so may delegate no more than the authority to make policies and rules that  implement its statutes.  Field, 143 U. S., at 693-694. Though in 1935  we struck down two delegations for lack of an intelligible principle, A.  L. A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U. S. 495 (1935), and  Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U. S. 388 (1935), we have since upheld,  without exception, delegations under standards phrased in sweeping  terms.

S.  190, 216-217, 225-226 (1943) (upholding delegation to the Federal Communications Commission to regulate radio broadcasting according to  \"public interest, convenience, or necessity\").  Had the delegations here  called for the exercise of judgment or discretion that lies beyond the  traditional authority of the President, Loving's last argument that  Congress failed to provide guiding principles to the President might  have more weight.  We find no fault, however, with the delegation in  this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "48\n",
      "In United States v. Curtis, the Court of Military Appeals discerned a principle limiting the President's discretion to define  aggravating factors for capital crimes in Article 36: namely, the  directive that regulations the President prescribes must \"apply the  principles of law . . . generally recognized in the trial of criminal  cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be  contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter,\" 10 U. S. C. Section(s)  836(a).  We think, however, that the question to be asked is not whether  there was any explicit principle telling the President how to select  aggravating factors, but whether any such guidance was needed, given the nature of the delegation and the officer who is to exercise the delegated authority.  First, the delegation is set within boundaries the  President may not exceed.  Second, the delegation here was to the  President in his role as Commander in Chief. Perhaps more explicit  guidance as to how to select aggravating factors would be necessary if  delegation were made to a newly created entity without independent  authority in the area.  Cf. Mistretta, 488 U. S., at 374-379 (upholding  delegation to the United States Sentencing Commission because of  detailed congressional directives channeling agency discretion).  The President's duties as Commander in Chief, however, require him to take  responsible and continuing action to superintend the military, including  the courts-martial.  The delegated duty, then, is interlinked with  duties already assigned to the President by express terms of the  Constitution, and the same limitations on delegation do not apply \"where  the entity exercising the delegated authority itself possesses  independent authority over the subject matter,\" United States v.  Mazurie, 419 U. S. 544, 556-557 (1975).  See also United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., 299 U. S. 304, 319-322 (1936).  Cf. Swaim  v. United States, 165 U. S. 553, 557-558 (1897) (President has inherent  authority to convene courts-martial).  Like the Court of Military  Appeals, Curtis, 32 M. J., at 263, n. 9, we need not decide whether the  President would have inherent power as Commander in Chief to prescribe  aggravating factors in capital cases.  Once delegated that power by  Congress, the President, acting in his constitutional office of  Commander in Chief, had undoubted competency to prescribe those factors  without further guidance.  \"The military constitutes a specialized  community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian,\" Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U. S. 83, 94 (1953), and the President can be  entrusted to determine what limitations and conditions on punishments  are best suited to preserve that special discipline.\n",

It  would be contradictory to say that Congress cannot further empower him  to limit by prospective regulation the circumstances in which  courtsmartial can impose a death sentence.

To be sure, there is  ample precedent in our cases for looking to the history of English  courts-martial -- but not where the question is of the sort before us  today.  We have surveyed that history for the purpose of establishing  the permissible scope of the jurisdiction of military tribunals over certain classes of defendants and offenses, see, e.g., Solorio v. United  States, 483 U. S. 435, 442-446 (1987); Lee v. Madigan, 358 U. S. 228,  232 (1959); Reid v. Covert, 354 U. S. 1, 23-27 (1957) (plurality); see  also Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 745 (1974).  This case does not  present such a question.  Petitioner does not assert that tradition  establishes his offense to be, in its nature, beyond the jurisdiction of  military courts, or that courts-martial are historically incapable of  adjudicating capital offenses.  His arguments are altogether different:  that Congress cannot authorize the President to establish \"aggravating  factors\" designed to carry out the narrowing function that (we assume)  is necessary for imposition of a capital sentence; and that, even if Congress can give the President authority to perform this function, such  authorization has not been effected by the statutes upon which the  Government relies.\n",

I would leave this historical  discussion aside.

Legislative power is nondelegable. Congress can no more \"delegate\" some  of its Article I power to the Executive than it could \"delegate\" some to  one of its committees.  What Congress does is to assign responsibilities  to the Executive; and when the Executive undertakes those assigned responsibilities it acts, not as the \"delegate\" of Congress, but as the  agent of the People.  At some point the responsibilities assigned can  become so extensive and so unconstrained that Congress has in effect  delegated its legislative power; but until that point of excess is  reached there exists, not a \"lawful\" delegation, but no delegation at  all.\n",

I, Section(s) 8, cl.  14, and the unique nature of the military's mission, we have afforded an  unparalleled degree of deference to congressional action governing the  military.  See Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U. S. 57, 64-65 (1981).  \"[I]t  is the primary business of armies and navies to fight or be ready to  fight wars should the occasion arise,\" United States ex rel. Toth v.  Quarles, 350 U. S. 11, 17 (1955), and this Court has recognized the  limits on its own competence in advancing this core national interest,  see Gilligan v. Morgan, 413 U. S. 1, 10 (1973).  Mindful of the factors  that \"differentiate military society from civilian society,\" we have concluded that the Constitution permits Congress \"to legislate both with  greater breadth and with greater flexibility when prescribing the rules  by which the former shall be governed than it is when prescribing rules  for the latter.\"  Parker v. Levy, 417 U. S. 733, 756 (1974).  This  heightened deference extends not only to congressional action but also  to executive action by the President, who by virtue of his constitutional role as Commander in Chief, see U. S. Const, Art. II,  Section(s) 2, cl. 1, possesses shared authority over military discipline.  See Schlesinger v. Ballard, 419 U. S. 498, 510 (1975) (\"The  responsibility for determining how best our Armed Forces shall attend to  th[e] business [of fighting or preparing to fight wars] rests with  Congress and with the President\") (citations omitted).  See also Brown  v. Glines, 444 U. S. 348, 360 (1980) (\"Both Congress and this Court have  found that the special character of the military requires civilian  authorities to accord military commanders some flexibility in dealing  with matters that affect internal discipline and morale.  In construing  a statute that touches on such matters, therefore, courts must be  careful not to `circumscribe the authority of military commanders to an extent never intended by Congress'\") (citations omitted).  Under these  and many similar cases reviewing legislative and executive control of  the military, the sentencing scheme at issue in this case, and the  manner in which it was created, are constitutionally unassailable.\n",

      "On a separate point, I agree with Justice Scalia that the majority's extended analysis of the division of authority between the  English Parliament and the Crown with regard to regulation of the  military, see ante, at 10-17, has no relevance to this case. It is true  that we frequently consult English history and common law in attempting  to determine the content of constitutional provisions, but the majority  fails to cite a single separation-of-powers case in which we have relied  on the structure of the English Government in attempting to understand the governmental structure erected by the Framers of the Constitution.  Nor does the majority cite any historical evidence, whether from the  constitutional debates, the Federalist Papers, or some other source,  that demonstrates that the Framers sought to embrace, or at least  actively considered, the English system of shared power over the  military.  If the majority pointed to some basis for conducting the  inquiry that it does, I might be willing to accept its analysis.  Instead, the majority repeatedly substitutes ipse dixit for historical  evidence.  See, e.g., ante, at 11 (\"From the English experience the  Framers . . . knew the . . . parliamentary practice of delegation\" and  \"[t]he Framers' choice in Clause 14 was to give Congress the same  flexibility to exercise or share power\"); ante, at 16 (\"the Framers well  knew this history\"); ante, at 17 (\"The historical necessities and events  of the English constitutional experience . . . were familiar to [the  Framers] and inform our understanding of the purpose and meaning of  constitutional provisions\").  I have no doubt that the Framers were well  versed in English history.  But it is too simplistic for purposes of  constitutional analysis to draw conclusions about the allocation of  constitutional author-ity among the branches of the United States  Government from mere speculation about the Framers' familiarity with  English military history and the significance that they attached to it.\n",

      "* Arnon and Michal Mozes are Israeli citizens. Married in 1982, they have four children, ranging in age from seven to sixteen years. Until 1997, parents and children lived in Israel, as they had their entire lives. In April 1997, with Arnon's consent, Michal and the children came to Los Angeles. Michal had long wanted to live in the United States, and both parents agreed that the children would profit from a chance to attend school here, learn English and partake of American culture. Accordingly, Michal moved with the children to Beverly Hills, where she leased a home, purchased automobiles and enrolled the children in school. Arnon remained in Israel, but he paid for both the house and the automobiles used by his family, and stayed with them at the house during his visits to Los Angeles. The parties agree that Arnon consented to have Michal and the children remain in the United States for fifteen months, though they disagree as to what understanding existed beyond that. What we know for certain is that on April 17, 1998, a year after they arrived in the United States, Michal filed an action in the Los Angeles County Superior Court seeking dissolution of the marriage and custody of the children. The court granted temporary custody to Michal, and entered a temporary restraining order enjoining Arnon from removing the children from southern California. Less than a month later, Arnon filed a petition in federal district court, seeking to have the children returned to Israel under the Hague Convention. The oldest child elected to return to Israel, and did so by mutual agreement of the parents. Arnon now appeals the district court's denial of his petition with regard to the three younger children.1\n",

      "Adopted in 1980, the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction [\"Convention\"]2 is intended to prevent \"the use of force to establish artificial jurisdictional links on an international level, with a view to obtaining custody of a child.\" Elisa Perez-Vera, Explanatory Report ¶ 11, in 3 Hague Conference on Private International Law, Acts and Documents of the Fourteenth Session, Child Abduction 426 (1982) [\"Perez-Vera Report\"].3 Despite the image conjured by words like \"abduction\" and \"force,\" the Convention was not drafted in response to any concern about violent kidnappings by strangers. It was aimed, rather, at the \"unilateral removal or retention of children by parents, guardians or close family members.\" Beaumont & McEleavy, The Hague Convention on International Child Abduction 1 (1999). Such an abductor \"rarely seeks material gain; rather, he or she will aspire to the exercise of sole care and control over a son or daughter in a new jurisdiction.\" Id. The preamble to the Convention describes the signatory states as \"[d]esiring to protect children internationally from the harmful effects of their wrongful removal or retention,\" effects which are thought to follow when a child \"is taken out of the family and social environment in which its life has developed.\" Perez-Vera Report at ¶ 11. This may occur either through the \"removal [of a child] from its habitual environment,\" or by \"a refusal to restore a child to its own environment after a stay abroad.\" Id. at ¶ 12.\n",

      "The Convention seeks to deter those who would undertake such abductions by eliminating their primary motivation for doing so. Since the goal of the abductor generally is \"to obtain a right of custody from the authorities of the country to which the child has been taken,\" Id. at ¶ 13, the signatories to the Convention have agreed to \"deprive his actions of any practical or juridical consequences.\" Id. at ¶ 16. To this end, when a child who was habitually residing in one signatory state is wrongfully removed to, or retained in, another, Article 12 provides that the latter state \"shall order the return of the child forthwith.\" Id., art. 12, 19 I.L.M. at 1502. Further, Article 16 provides that \"until it has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this Convention,\" the judicial or administrative authorities of a signatory state \"shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody.\" Convention, art. 16, 19 I.L.M. at 1503.

See Mozes v. Mozes, 19 F. Supp. 2d 1108, 1116 (C.D. Cal. 1998). Our central task is to review this finding, which we do immediately below.

      "We begin by identifying the role of an appellate court in reviewing a determination of habitual residence under the Hague Convention. In doing so, we are mindful that Congress has emphasized \"the need for uniform international interpretation of the Convention.\" 42 U.S.C. § 11601(b)(3)(B). The Perez-Vera Report describes \"habitual residence\" as \"a well-established concept in the Hague Conference, which regards it as a question of pure fact, differing in that respect from domicile.\" Perez-Vera Report at ¶ 66. In seeking to understand this \"well-established concept,\" id., we discover that although the term \"habitual residence\" appears throughout the various Hague Conventions,6 none of them defines it. As one commentary explains, \"this has been a matter of deliberate policy, the aim being to leave the notion free from technical rules which can produce rigidity and inconsistencies as between different legal systems.\" J.H.C. Morris, Dicey and Morris on the Conflict of Laws 144 (10th ed. 1980) [\"Dicey & Morris\"].\n",

      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "Clearly, the Hague Conference wished to avoid linking the determination of which country should exercise jurisdiction over a custody dispute to the idiosyncratic legal definitions of domicile and nationality of the forum where the child happens to have been removed. This would obviously undermine uniform application of the Convention and encourage forum-shopping by would-be abductors. To avoid this, courts have been instructed to interpret the expression \"habitual residence\" according to \"the ordinary and natural meaning of the two words it contains[, as] a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of any particular case.\" C v S (minor: abduction: illegitimate child), [1990] 2 All E.R. 961, 965 (Eng. H.L.).\n",

      "\n",
      "13\n",
      "Certain commentators, however, have gone considerably farther than this, decrying as an unwelcome technical rule any attempt to develop guiding principles for courts to consult when making findings of \"habitual residence.\"7 This has not, of course, prevented courts faced with disputes under the Convention from articulating what they understand the \"ordinary and natural meaning\" of the two words to be, or from looking to cases decided by other courts for help in refining and applying that meaning. Nor should it. Facts, after all, do not come with labels attached, and the family situations of petitioners under the Convention are likely to be quite different from what most people consider \"ordinary.\" In order for decisions under the Convention to be intelligible, courts must be able to explain these conclusions and the reasoning used to reach them. To achieve the uniformity of application across countries, which depends upon the realization of the Convention's goals, courts must be able to reconcile their decisions with those reached by other courts in similar situations. As the leading treatise on the Convention has observed, \"[o]nly in exchanging and considering other views will a sophisticated and uniform interpretation evolve.\" Beaumont & McEleavy, page 4 supra, at 238. Cutting fact-finding tribunals adrift with only the Bellman's map to guide them does not lead to consistency; it leads only to the absence of any common standard by which inconsistency can be identified.8\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "The Convention seeks to protect children by creating a system of rules that will inform certain decisions made by their parents. \"Habitual residence\" is the central--often outcome-determinative--concept on which the entire system is founded.9 Without intelligibility and consistency in its application, parents are deprived of crucial information they need to make decisions, and children are more likely to suffer the harms the Convention seeks to prevent.10 Imagine, for example, a parent trying to decide whether to travel with a child to attempt reconciliation with an estranged spouse in another country,11 or whether to consent to a child's trip abroad to stay with in-laws.12 Such parents would be vitally interested in knowing under what circumstances a child's habitual residence is likely to be altered, and it is cold comfort to be told only that this is \"a question of fact to be decided by reference to all the circumstances of any particular case.\" C v S, [1990] 2 All E.R. at 965. Parents faced with this response would likely regard the introduction of a few judicial \"presuppositions and presumptions,\" Dicey & Morris, page 8 supra at 145, with more relief than alarm.\n",

Evans-Feder, 63 F.3d 217, 222 n.9 (3d Cir. 1995).14  Our own precedent puts it somewhat differently: To the extent that the question is essentially factual, one \"founded 'on the application of the fact-finding tribunal's experience with the mainsprings of human conduct,'\" we review the district court's determination only for clear error.

      "Perhaps the most straightforward way to determine someone's habitual residence would be to observe his behavior. As Lord Scarman put it, \"in their natural and ordinary meaning the words mean that the person must be habitually and normally resident here, apart from temporary or occasional absences of long or short duration.\" Shah, [1983] 1 All E.R. at 234 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this approach, we might say that if we observe someone centering his life around a particular location during a given period, so that every time he goes away from it he also comes back, we will call this his habitual residence.\n",

      "This approach, while intuitively appealing, suffers from a fatal flaw: It may yield strikingly different results depending on the observer's time frame. A child who spends two months at Camp Chippewah, if observed only during that period, would appear to be habitually resident there. On the other hand, if we follow the same child through to adulthood, we might label a couple of years spent studying abroad a mere \"temporary absence of long duration.\" This indeterminacy is unavoidable, as it is \"not desirable, indeed it is not possible, to enter into any game of numbers on the duration required.\" Adderson v. Adderson, 51 Alta. L.R. (2d) 193, 198 (Alberta C.A. 1987). The absence of an objective temporal baseline however, requires that we pay close attention to subjective intent when evaluating someone's habitual residence.15 Elaborating on the subjective element of the inquiry, Lord Scarman reasoned that for habitual residence to accrue, there must be a \"settled purpose\":\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "The purpose may be one or there may be several. It may be specific or general. All the law requires is that there is [sic] a settled purpose. That is not to say that the propositus intends to stay where he is indefinitely; indeed his purpose, while settled, may be for a limited period. Education, business or profession, employment, health, family or merely love of the place spring to mind as common reasons for a choice of regular abode. And there may well be many others. All that is necessary is that the purpose of living where one does has a sufficient degree of continuity to be properly described as settled.\n",

      "This passage makes some intuitive sense. Being habitually resident in a place must mean that you are, in some sense, \"settled\" there--but it need not mean that's where you plan to leave your bones. Nor could we justify limiting habitual residence to persons who settle in an area for some particular motive. All of this is true. None of it is very useful, however, when attempting to decide a borderline case. Even the child who goes off to summer camp arguably has a \"settled purpose\" to live there continuously \"for a limited period.\" Id. No one would seriously contend that the summer camp is the child's habitual residence, but the notion of \"settled purpose\" alone is powerless to tell us why not.16\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "The obvious reason why the camper is not regarded as habitually resident is that he already has an established habitual residence elsewhere and his absence from it--even for an entire summer--is no indication that he means to abandon it.

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26\n",
      "[T]here is a significant difference between a person ceasing to be habitually resident in country A, and his subsequently becoming habitually resident in country B. A person may cease to be habitually resident in country A in a single day if he or she leaves it with a settled intention not to return to it but to take up long-term residence in country B instead. Such a person cannot, however, become habitually resident in country B in a single day. An appreciable period of time and a settled intention will be necessary to enable him or her to become so.\n",

      "C v S (minor: abduction: illegitimate child), [1990] 2 All E.R. at 965. As this passage illustrates, the first step toward acquiring a new habitual residence is forming a settled intention to abandon the one left behind.17 Otherwise, one is not habitually residing; one is away for a temporary absence of long or short duration.18 Of course, one need not have this settled intention at the moment of departure; it could coalesce during the course of a stay abroad originally intended to be temporary. Nor need the intention be expressly declared, if it is manifest from one's actions; indeed, one's actions may belie any declaration that no abandonment was intended.19 If you've lived continuously in the same place for several years on end, for example, we would be hard-pressed to conclude that you had not abandoned any prior habitual residence.20 On the other hand, one may effectively abandon a prior habitual residence without intending to occupy the next one for more than a limited period.21 Whether there is a settled intention to abandon a prior habitual residence is a question of fact as to which we defer to the district court.\n",

      "29\n",
      "Having concluded that a settled intention to abandon one's prior habitual residence is a crucial part of acquiring a new one, we confront an additional problem: Whose settled intention determines whether a child has abandoned a prior habitual residence? One obvious response would be, the child's. It is, after all, the child whose habitual residence we are out to determine. And indeed we sometimes find courts declaring the intentions of the parents to be irrelevant.22 There is an obvious problem with this approach, however. Children, particularly the ones whose return may be ordered under the Convention,23 normally lack the material and psychological wherewithal to decide where they will reside. This leads to the conclusion that, \"in those cases where intention or purpose is relevant --for example, where it is necessary to decide whether an absence is intended to be temporary and short-term--the intention or purpose which has to be taken into account is that of the person or persons entitled to fix the place of the child's residence.\"24\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "30\n",
      "Difficulty arises, of course, when the persons entitled to fix the child's residence no longer agree on where it has been fixed--a situation that, for obvious reasons, is likely to arise in cases under the Convention. In these cases, the representations of the parties cannot be accepted at face value, and courts must determine from all available evidence whether the parent petitioning for return of a child has already agreed to the child's taking up habitual residence where it is. The factual circumstances in which this question arises are diverse, but we can divide the cases into three broad categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "31\n",
      "On one side are cases where the court finds that the family as a unit has manifested a settled purpose to change habitual residence, despite the fact that one parent may have had qualms about the move.25 Most commonly, this occurs when both parents and the child translocate together under circumstances suggesting that they intend to make their home in the new country. When courts find that a family has jointly taken all the steps associated with abandoning habitual residence in one country to take it up in another, they are generally unwilling to let one parent's alleged reservations about the move stand in the way of finding a shared and settled purpose.26\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "32\n",
      "On the other side are cases where the child's initial translocation from an established habitual residence was clearly intended to be of a specific, delimited period. In these cases, courts have generally refused to find that the changed intentions of one parent led to an alteration in the child's habitual residence.27\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "In between are cases where the petitioning parent had earlier consented to let the child stay abroad for some period of ambiguous duration. Sometimes the circumstances surrounding the child's stay are such that, despite the lack of perfect consensus, the court finds the parents to have shared a settled mutual intent that the stay last indefinitely.28 When this is the case, we can reasonably infer a mutual abandonment of the child's prior habitual residence. Other times, however, circumstances are such that, even though the exact length of the stay was left open to negotiation, the court is able to find no settled mutual intent from which such abandonment can be inferred.29 Clearlythis is one of those questions of \"historical and narrative facts\" in which the findings of the district court are entitled to great deference.

      "While the decision to alter a child's habitual residence depends on the settled intention of the parents, they cannot accomplish this transformation by wishful thinking alone. First, it requires an actual \"change in geography.\" Friedrich, 983 F.2d at 1402. Second, home isn't built in a day. It requires the passage of \"[a]n appreciable period of time,\" C v S (minor: abduction: illegitimate child), [1990] 2 All E.R. 961, 965 (Eng. H.L.), one that is \"sufficient for acclimatization.\" Feder, 63 F.3d at 224. When the child moves to a new country accompanied by both parents, who take steps to set up a regular household together, the period need not be long.30 On the other hand, when circumstances are such as to hinder acclimatization, even a lengthy period spent in this manner may not suffice.31\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "36\n",
      "A more difficult question is when evidence of acclimatization should suffice to establish a child's habitual residence, despite uncertain or contrary parental intent. Most agree that, given enough time and positive experience, a child's life may become so firmly embedded in the new country as to make it habitually resident even though there be lingering parental intentions to the contrary.32 The question is how readily courts should reach the conclusion that this has occurred. Since the Convention seeks to prevent harms thought to flow from wrenching or keeping a child from its familiar surroundings, it is tempting to regard any sign of a child's familiarity with the new country as lessening the need for return and making a finding of altered habitual residence desirable. Further, some courts regard the question whether a child is doing well in school, has friends, and so on, as more straightforward and objective than asking whether the parents share a \"settled intent.\"33 Despite the superficial appeal of focusing primarily on the child's contacts in the new country, however, we conclude that, in the absence of settled parental intent, courts should be slow to infer from such contacts that an earlier habitual residence has been abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "37\n",
      "The Convention is designed to prevent child abduction by reducing the incentive of the would-be abductor to seek unilateral custody over a child in another country. The greater the ease with which habitual residence may be shifted without the consent of both parents, the greater the incentive to try. The question whether a child is in some sense \"settled\" in its new environment is so vague as to allow findings of habitual residence based on virtually any indication that the child has generally adjusted to life there.34 Further, attempting to make the standard more rigorous might actually make matters worse, as it could open children to harmful manipulation when one parent seeks to foster residential attachments during what was intended to be a temporary visit--such as having the child profess allegiance to the new sovereign. See note 34 supra. The function of a court applying the Convention is not to determine whether a child is happy where it currently is, but whether one parent is seeking unilaterally to alter the status quo with regard to the primary locus of the child's life.35\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "38\n",
      "Even if deliberate manipulation were not a danger, divining from a child's observed contacts in a new country whether it has come to reside there habitually would be an enterprise fraught with difficulty. Children can be remarkably adaptable and form intense attachments even in short periods of time--yet this does not necessarily mean that the child expects or intends those relationships to be long-lived. It is quite possible to participate in all the activities of daily life while still retaining awareness that one has another life to go back to. In such instances one may be \"acclimatized\" in the sense of being well-adjusted in one's present environment, yet not regard that environment as one's habitual residence.36 It thus makes sense to regard the intentions of the parents as affecting the length of time necessary for a child to become habitually resident,37because the child's knowledge of these intentions is likely to color its attitude toward the contacts it is making.38\n",

      "As these considerations illustrate, the broad claim that observing \"la realite que vivent les enfants\" obviates any need to consider the intent of the parents, Y.D., [1996] R.J.Q. at 2523, is unsound. It also runs counter to the idea that determinations of habitual residence should take into account \"all the circumstances of any particular case.\" C v S, [1990] 2 All E.R. at 965. It is easy enough for a court to eschew inquiry into parental intent in cases where other factors are conclusive. But just as hard cases make bad law, easy cases can make for overly broad law--particularly when unqualified statements come to be applied outside of the factual contexts that inspired them. In Friedrich, for example, the court's statement that we must \"focus on the child, not the parents,\" 983 F.2d at 1401, came in response to the claims of a mother that her child was habitually resident in the U.S. even though it had always lived in Germany, because she intended to move there with it upon discharge from the military. See id. All the Friedrich court needed to say in order to reach the correct and obvious result was that, whatever the parents' intent, habitual residence cannot be acquired without physical presence. The facts of Friedrich thus provided no legitimate occasion for a broad pronouncement that parental intent is irrelevant to the question of habitual residence.39\n",

      "40\n",
      "Similarly, the Quebec Court of Appeal in Y.D. made a rhetorical argument against the use of parental intent in general,40 based on a conflict that most courts would consider trivial. Both parents had moved to California with their children and lived with them there continuously for three years, leaving behind no possessions in Canada. See Y.D., [1996] R.J.Q. at 2516. When the marriage deteriorated, one parent claimed that the stay had been intended to be temporary. See id. There is little room for doubt that the children had become acclimatized in California, but the same facts also support a finding that the couple had manifested a shared intent to abandon the family's prior habitual residence.41 Y.D., then, does not illustrate the superiority of focusing exclusively on the circumstances of the child; it illustrates that easy cases are easy, however one analyzes them.\n",

      "While this rule certainly furthers the policy of discouraging child abductions, it has been criticized as needing to be \"carefully qualified if it [is] not to lead to absurd results.\"42 The point is well taken: Habitual residence is intended to be a description of a factual state of affairs, and a child can lose its habitual attachment to a place even without a parent's consent. Even when there is no settled intent on the part of the parents to abandon the child's prior habitual residence, courts should find a change in habitual residence if \"the objective facts point unequivocally to a person's ordinary or habitual residence being in a particular place.\" Zenel v. Haddow, 1993 S.L.T. 975, 979 (Scot. 1st Div.). The question in these cases is not simply whether the child's life in the new country shows some minimal \"degree of settled purpose,\" Shah, [1983] 1 All E.R. at 235, but whether we can say with confidence that the child's relative attachments to the two countries have changed to the point where requiring return to the original forum would now be tantamount to taking the child \"out of the family and social environment in which its life has developed.\" Perez-Vera Report, page 3 supra, at ¶ 11.\n",

At the very least, the parties discussed the possibility of the children remaining in the United States for another year, and may have even come to such an understanding.

      "The district court's reticence is not surprising, given the striking difference between this case and those where courts faced with similarly ambiguous facts have found a settled intent in favor of indefinite residence. In those cases, the country in which it had been agreed the child should spend time was the native country of one of the parents.44 It is entirely natural and foreseeable that, if a child goes to live with a parent in that parent's native land on an open-ended basis, the child will soon begin to lose its habitual ties to any prior residence. A parent who agrees to such an arrangement without any clear limitations may well be held to have accepted this eventuality.\n",

All of the family's relatives were there. Further, Michal and the children left for the United States with a temporary visa, casting considerable doubt on whether they would be allowed to remain here indefinitely even if they wished to.45 Finally, while Michal took steps to obtain work in the United States, the economic base on which the family depended for sustenance remained entirely in Israel.

Supp. 2d at 1115. This is true; it is not a necessary condition. When a child has no clearly established habitual residence elsewhere, it may become habitually resident even in a place where it was intended to live only for a limited time.46 The same is true if the child's prior habitual residence has been effectively abandoned by the shared intent of the parents. Where there is no such intent, however, a prior habitual residence should be deemed supplanted only where \"the objective facts point unequivocally\" to this conclusion. Zenel, 1993 S.L.T. at 979.

      "The academic year abroad has become a familiar phenomenon in which thousands of families across the globe participate every year.

Yet the ordinary expectation--shared by both parents and children--is that, upon completion of the year, the students will resume residence in their home countries. If this were not the expectation, one would find few parents willing to let their children have these valuable experiences. The Mozes children departed from Israel with this normal expectation, and there is no evidence that anyone questioned it until their mother decided to file for divorce. The case, then, does not reflect the sort of \"brute facts\" that require a finding of altered habitual residence so as to avoid an \"absurd result[].\" Clive, note 7 supra, at 145-46.\n",

See Zenel, 1993 S.L.T. at 979. Five months prior to her sudden decision to remove the child to Scotland, the mother herself had obtained full-time employment in Australia. See id. These are the sorts of objective actions that ordinarily lead courts to find a settled intent on the part of a family to take up habitual residence. In Re A and others, the family had lived together in Iceland for two years, and the court found that, while the stay was not expected to last indefinitely, \"[t]hey had no home base of their own elsewhere.\" [1996] 1 All E.R. at 32.\n",

Given that the Mozes children had a clearly established habitual residence in Israel in April 1997, and that the district court did not find an intent to abandon this residence in favor of the United States, the question it needed to answer was not simply whether the children had in some sense \"become settled\" in this country.

If, on the other hand, the district court decides that the facts do not warrant such a finding, it will have to resolve a series of additional questions. The first of these is whether the retention breached rights of custody attributed to Arnon under Israeli law.52 See pages 6-7 supra. Only if this is the case is the retention wrongful under Article 3 of the Convention. See Convention, art. 3, 19 I.L.M. at 1501.\n",

By seeking sole custody over the children outside their state of habitual residence then, Michal \"disregarded the rights of the other parent which are also protected by law, and . . . interfered with their normal exercise.\" Perez-Vera Report, page 3 supra, at ¶ 71.54  Nor is there any doubt that Arnon was exercising his parental rights and responsibilities up until the time Michal sought custody. As the district court noted, he had remained in regular contact with his family, visited them several times, and \"provided all finances needed to support his wife and children in California.\" Mozes, 19 F. Supp. 2d at 1111. This means that if the children's habitual residence was still in Israel on April 17, 1998, their retention here would be wrongful under the Convention, and the United States would be required under Article 12 to order their return forthwith so that an Israeli court may consider the question of custody.55\n",

Unlike Article 3, which restricts a court's inquiry to the state of affairs prevailing immediately prior to the retention or removal alleged to be wrongful, see page 6 supra, two of the exceptions in Article 13--namely, the risk of physical or psychological harm and objection by a mature child to its return--depend on circumstances at the time a child's return is to be ordered.57 Should the district court find a wrongful retention to have occurred, it must make a prompt determination as to whether either of these exceptions is applicable58 and, if not, order the return of the children to Israel forthwith.\n",

By seeking to have this determination made in the United States rather than in the country of the children's habitual residence, Michal did precisely what the Convention was intended to prevent.

      " We take judicial notice of the fact that, after the district court decided the case and while it was on appeal before us, the Los Angeles Superior Court entered an award in the custody proceeding which it had previously stayed pending resolution of Arnon's claim in the district court. Article 16 of the Convention provides, in pertinent part, that \"[a]fter receiving notice of a wrongful removal or retention of a child in the sense of Article 3, the judicial or administrative authorities of the Contracting State to which the child has been removed or in which it has been retained shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody until it has been determined that the child is not to be returned under this Convention . . .\" Convention, art. 17, 19 I.L.M. at 1503 (emphasis added). Because it has not yet been determined whether the Mozes children must be returned under the Convention, the Superior Court's custody decree is premature. We presume that the Superior Court, or the district court on remand, will take appropriate steps to ensure its compliance with the Convention.\n",
      "It is worth noting that the district court would not be barred by the Rooker-Feldman doctrine from vacating the Superior Court's custodial decree or its order enjoining removal of the children from California. See Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923) (holding federal statutory jurisdiction over direct appeals from state courts beyond the original jurisdiction of federal district courts); District of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 486-87 (1983) (holding that claims \"inextricably intertwined\" with those a state court has already decided beyond the jurisdiction of lower federal courts). Because the doctrine is one of congressional intent, not constitutional mandate, it follows that where Congress has specifically granted jurisdiction to the federal courts, the doctrine does not apply. See, e.g., In re Gruntz, 202 F.3d 1074, 1078-79 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc) (noting that through statutory writ of habeas corpus and bankruptcy statutes Congress permits federal collateral review of state court and criminal bankruptcy judgments). In this case, Congress has expressly granted the federal courts jurisdiction to vindicate rights arising under the Convention. See 42 U.S.C. §11603(a). Thus, federal courts must have the power to vacate state custody determinations and other state court orders that contravene the treaty.\n",

      "  The remaining exception is clearly inapplicable. As we have pointed out above, the district court found that Arnon continued to exercise his parental rights up until the time of the retention. See page 44 supra.

The Church of the Creator is a recognized religious charity. The World Church of the Creator, as a racist group, is not entitled to that benefit, see Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574, 103 S.Ct. 2017, 76 L.Ed.2d 157 (1983), and has had its charitable status revoked by both state and federal governments. See Church of the Creator, Inc. v.

      "The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) granted the Foundation's application in 1988, though it required the Foundation to disclaim any right to the word \"church.\" See Trademark Registration No. 1,496,724. Five years passed, during which Klassen's group did not protest this registration. The PTO then accepted and filed a declaration that the mark had become incontestable under 15 U.S.C. § 1065 — which means that it may be enforced, without proof of secondary meaning, even if it is a descriptive name for the qualities or characteristics of a good or service. See Park `N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park and Fly, Inc., 469 U.S. 189, 105 S.Ct. 658, 83 L.Ed.2d 582 (1985). When the Foundation began to receive protests about its supposedly racist creed — complaints demonstrating confusion between the two groups — it set out to enforce its incontestable mark by seeking an injunction against the World Church's use of what is obviously a confusingly similar name. The groups' symbology differs, as the World Church's banner shows:\n",

      "\n",
      "16\n",
      "Although an incontestable mark may be enforced even if it is descriptive, it is subject to cancellation if it is or becomes generic. Section 1065, which sets out the rules for incontestable marks, begins: \"Except on a ground for which application to cancel may be filed at any time under paragraphs (3) and (5) of section 1064 of this title\", and § 1064(3) permits cancellation \"[a]t any time if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the goods or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered.\" Thus as the Court recognized in Park `N Fly an incontestable mark does not confer any rights to a phrase that was generic at the outset or has become so through use. \"A generic term is one that refers to the genus of which the particular product is a species.\" 469 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 658. The World Church's defense in this suit is that \"Church of the Creator\" is generic: that it names the genus of all monotheistic religions, of which particular creeds such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (and all their many subdivisions) are the species. The Foundation replied with two procedural points: first, that although generic status allows cancellation of a mark by the PTO under § 1064, it does not afford a defense while the mark remains uncancelled; second, that incontestable status provides at least a powerful presumption that the mark is non-generic, a presumption that can be overcome only by strong evidence of actual usage. The district judge brushed aside both of these arguments and, relying exclusively on dictionary definitions of the word \"creator,\" entered summary judgment for the World Church. TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation — Family of URI, Inc. v. World Church of the Creator, 2002 WL 126103, 2002 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 1478 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 31, 2002).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "On appeal the Foundation repeats its contention that the PTO, rather than a court, is the proper forum for any contention that an incontestable mark is generic. This contention, which relies principally on 15 U.S.C. § 1115(b) (\"To the extent that the right to use the registered mark has become incontestable under section 1065 of this title, the registration shall be conclusive evidence of the validity of the registered mark\"), finds some support in the language of Sovereign Order of St. John of Jerusalem, Inc. v. Grady, 119 F.3d 1236, 1240 (6th Cir.1997), but not in the holding of that or any other circuit — and it is untenable. Even if a mark must be canceled before enforcement may be denied, trademark law does not reserve the cancellation power to the PTO. A court may cancel a mark itself or order the agency to do so. 15 U.S.C. § 1119. So even if the sequence must be generic status to cancellation to nonenforcement, a court can handle all of the stages. This means that the generic nature of a mark may be a defense in litigation. And if a court may order a mark canceled, an incontestable registration is more like a bursting-bubble presumption of non-generic-ness than like the sort of indomitable presumption that the Foundation seeks. Like the district court, then, we proceed to ask whether \"Church of the Creator\" is generic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "Unlike the district court, we conclude that this phrase is descriptive rather than generic. Appellate review of a summary-judgment decision is plenary. Both sides moved for summary judgment, so each was required to introduce evidence to show that a material issue of disputed fact remained for decision. Confronted with the Foundation's motion, the World Church produced — nothing but a dictionary. It did not offer any evidence about how religious adherents use or understand the phrase as a unit. It offered only lexicographers' definitions of the individual words. That won't cut the mustard, because dictionaries reveal a range of historical meanings rather than how people use a particular phrase in contemporary culture. (Similarly, looking up the words \"cut\" and \"mustard\" would not reveal the meaning of the phrase we just used.)\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "Contemporary usage does not treat \"Church of the Creator\" as the name for monotheistic religion — or any other genus of religion. If it were, then the World Church itself would be misusing the phrase, for it is not theistic in any traditional sense and has nothing in common with Judaism, Christianity, or Islam. The World Church's web site, and much of its literature, feature one international negation symbol (a circle with a diagonal bar) superimposed over a Star of David and another superimposed over a cross. It condemns the Bible as a hoax.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "A mark is \"generic\" when it has become the name of a product (e.g., \"sandwich\" for meat between slices of bread) or class of products (thus \"church\" is generic). But \"Church of the Creator\" is descriptive, like \"lite beer.\" It does not name the class of monotheistic religions. In the contemporary United States, variations on \"Church of [Deity]\" are used to differentiate individual denominations, not to denote the class of all religions. The list is considerable: Church of God; Church of God (Anderson, Indiana); First Church of God; Worldwide Church of God (see Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church of God, Inc., 227 F.3d 1110 (9th Cir.2000)); Church of God in Christ; Assembly of God; Korean Assembly of God; Church of the Nazarene; Church of Christ; United Church of Christ; Disciples of Christ; Church of Christ, Scientist; Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. There is room for extension with Church of Our Savior, Church of the Holy Spirit, Church of the Holy Trinity, Church of Jehovah, and so on. Yet all of these are recognizable as denominational names, not as the designation of the religion to which the denominations belong. No Jewish, Islamic, Baha'i, or Unitarian group would say that it belongs to a \"Church of the Creator\"; and a Christian congregation would classify itself first into its denomination (e.g., Baptist, Lutheran, Russian Orthodox, Society of Friends), then into one of the major groupings (Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant), and finally into Christianity, but never into a \"Church of the Creator.\" No one called or emailed a Baptist church to complain about its complicity in the hate-mongering of the World Church of the Creator; people recognized the name as denominational, and that's why protests ended up in the Church of the Creator's in box.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "What is more, as these lists show, using \"Church of the Creator\" as a denominational name leaves ample options for other sects to distinguish themselves and achieve separate identities. It is not remotely like one firm appropriating the word \"sandwich\" and thus disabling its rivals from explaining to consumers what's to eat. When the line between generic and descriptive terms is indistinct — as it is, for example, with a phrase such as \"liquid controls,\" see Liquid Controls Corp. v. Liquid Control Corp., 802 F.2d 934 (7th Cir.1986) — it is helpful to ask whether one firm's exclusive use of the phrase will prevent a rival from naming itself and describing its product. (As far as the Lanham Act is concerned, a denomination is a producer and religious services and publications are products. Neither side has questioned the application of trademark laws to religion.) Because there are so many ways to describe religious denominations, there is no risk that exclusive use of \"Church of the Creator\" will appropriate a theology or exclude essential means of differentiating one set of beliefs from another.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "The World Church has a fallback argument: that recognizing a trademark in \"Church of the Creator\" violates the first amendment. Yet as San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Committee, 483 U.S. 522, 107 S.Ct. 2971, 97 L.Ed.2d 427 (1987), observed when rejecting a similar contention, the Constitution itself authorizes Congress to create rights of this kind. Cf. Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises, 471 U.S. 539, 105 S.Ct. 2218, 85 L.Ed.2d 588 (1985). Trademark rights promote the aims of the first amendment by enabling producers of the spoken and written word to differentiate themselves. If multiple businesses use the same (or confusingly similar) names, the result is cacophony rather than discussion or debate. If every candidate on the ballot ran under the same name, this would do more to befuddle the voters than to promote the candidates' freedom of expression. Cf. Grimes v. Smith, 585 F.Supp. 1084 (N.D.Ind.1984), affirmed, 776 F.2d 1359 (7th Cir.1985). It is questionable whether the World Church is a religion (not all philosophical beliefs are religious), but, if it is, still Congress need not exempt religions from generally applicable laws. See Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990). The World Church has every right to a distinctive name; it does not have a constitutional right to use some other denomination's incontestable trademark.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "By this time, a reader familiar with the Lanham Act may have grown frustrated by our inattention to what must seem the most obvious argument on behalf of the World Church: prior use. Ben Klassen published Nature's Eternal Religion, and adopted the name \"Church of the Creator,\" in 1973, nine years before the Foundation began using that phrase. Section 1065 provides that even incontestable marks must yield to \"a valid right acquired under the law of any State or Territory by use of a mark or trade name continuing from a date prior to the date of registration under this chapter of such registered mark\". Yet the World Church has not urged prior use as a defense, presumably because of the reorganization designed to avoid paying the judgment mentioned in this opinion's opening paragraph. The corporation that adopted the name \"Church of the Creator\" in 1973 no longer exists; the organization \"World Church of the Creator\" formed in 1996 is junior to the Foundation. It turns out that tactics adopted to avoid paying for one's wrongs have collateral costs.\n",

In 1945 he brought a petition for his release on writ of error in the Supreme Court of Illinois claiming that the conviction on which his confinement was based was vitiated by the denial of his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to the assistance of counsel. The Supreme Court of Illinois affirmed the original judgment of conviction. 391 Ill. 594, 63 N.E.2d 763.

      "In a series of cases of which Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543, was the first, and Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 327 U.S. 274, 66 S.Ct. 544, the latest, we have sustained an appeal to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for a fair ascertainment of guilt or innocence. Inherent in the notion of fairness is ample opportunity to meet an accusation. Under pertinent circumstances, the opportunity is ample only when an accused has the assistance of counsel for his defense. And the need for such assistance may exist at every stage of the prosecution, from arraignment to sentencing. This does not, however, mean that the accused may not make his own defense; nor does it prevent him from acknowledging guilt when fully advised of all its implications and capable of understanding them. Neither the historic conception of Due Process nor the vitality it derives from progressive standards of justice denies a person the right to defend himself or to confess guilt. Under appropriate circumstances the Constitution requires that counsel be tendered; it does not require that under all circumstances counsel be forced upon a defendant. United States ex rel. McCann v. Adams, 320 U.S. 220, 64 S.Ct. 14, 88 L.Ed. 4.\n",

      "The solicitude for securing justice thus embodied in the Due Process Clause is not satisfied by formal compliance or merely procedural regularity. It is not conclusive that the proceedings resulting in incarceration are unassailable on the face of the record. A State must give one whom it deprives of his freedom the opportunity to open an inquiry into the intrinsic fairness of a criminal process even though it appears proper on the surface. Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791, 98 A.L.R. 406. Questions of fundamental justice protected by the Due Process Clause may be raised, to use lawyers' language, dehors the record.\n",

      "\n",
      "4\n",
      "But the Due Process Clause has never been perverted so as to force upon the forty-eight States a uniform code of criminal procedure. Except for the limited scope of the federal criminal code, the prosecution of crime is a matter for the individual States. The Constitution commands the States to assure fair judgment. Procedural details for securing fairness it leaves to the States. It is for them, therefore, to choose the methods and practices by which crime is brought to book, so long as they observe those ultimate dignities of man which the United States Constitution assures. Brown v. State of New Jersey, 175 U.S. 172, 175, 20 S.Ct. 77, 78, 44 L.Ed. 119; State of Missouri v. Lewis, 101 U.S. 22, 31, 25 L.Ed. 989. Wide discretion must be left to the States for the manner of adjudicating a claim that a conviction is unconstitutional. States are free to devise their own systems of review in criminal cases. A State may decide whether to have direct appeals in such cases, and if so under what circumstances. McKane v. Durston, 153 U.S. 684, 687, 14 S.Ct. 913, 915, 38 L.Ed. 867. In respecting the duty laid upon them by Mooney v. Holohan, the States have a wide choice of remedies. A State may provide that the protection of rights granted by the Federal Constitution be sought through the writ of habeas corpus or coram nobis. It may use each of these ancient writs in its common law scope, or it may put them to new uses; or, it may afford remedy by a simple motion brought either in the court of original conviction or at the place of detention. See, e.g., New York ex rel. Whitman v. Wilson, 318 U.S. 688, 63 S.Ct. 840, 87 L.Ed. 1083; Matter of Lyons v. Goldstein, 290 N.Y. 19, 25, 47 N.E.2d 425, 146 A.L.R. 1422; Matter of Morhous v.

So long as the rights under the United States Constitution may be pursued, it is for a State and not for this Court to define the mode by which they may be vindicated.\n",

      "An accused may have been denied the assistance of counsel under circumstances which constitute an infringement of the United States Constitution. If the State affords no mode for redressing that wrong, he may come to the federal courts for relief. But where a remedy is provided by the State, a defendant must first exhaust it in the manner in which the State prescribes. Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 64 S.Ct. 448, 88 L.Ed. 572; House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 65 S.Ct. 517, 89 L.Ed. 739. For the relation of the United States and the courts of the United States to the States and the courts of the States is a very delicate matter. See Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 251, 6 S.Ct. 734, 740, 29 L.Ed. 868. When a defendant, as here, invokes a remedy provided by the State of Illinois the decision of the local court must be judged on the basis of the scope of the remedy provided and what the court properly had before it in such a proceeding. Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211, 66 S.Ct. 996. The only thing before the Illinois Supreme Court was what is known under Illinois practice as the common law record. That record, as certified in this case, included only the indictment, the judgment on plea of guilty, the minute entry bearing on sentence, and the sentence. And so the very narrow question now before us is whether this common law record establishes that the defendant's sentence is void because in the proceedings that led to it he was denied the assistance of counsel.\n",

      "This case is quite different from a case like Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786, 65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367. In that case the record properly before this Court contained specific allegations bearing on the disabilities of the defendant to stand prosecution without the aid of counsel. There was not, as we have here, an unchallenged finding by the trial court that the accused was duly apprised of his rights and, in awareness of them, chose to plead guilty. The judgment against Carter explicitly states:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "'And the said defendant Harice Leroy Carter commonly known as Roy Carter having been duly arraigned and being called upon to plead expresses a desire to plead guilty to the crime of murder as charged in the indictment. Thereupon the Court fully explained to the Defendant Harice Leroy Carter commonly known as Roy Carter the consequence of such plea and of all his rights in the premises including the right to have a lawyer appointed by the Court to defend him and also of his right to a trial before a jury of twelve jurors sworn in open Court and of the degree of proof that would be required to justify a verdict of guilty against him under the plea of not guilty but the defendant Harice Leroy Carter commonly known as Roy Carter persists in his desire to plead guilty and for a plea says he is guilty in manner and form as charged in the indictment.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "This, then, is not a case in which intelligent waiver of counsel is a tenuous inference from the mere fact of a plea of guilty. Rice v. Olson, supra, 324 U.S. at page 788, 65 S.Ct. at page 990, 89 L.Ed. 1367. A fair reading of the judgment against Carter indicates a judicial attestation that the accused, with his rights fully explained to him, consciously chose to dispense with counsel. And there is nothing in the record to contradict the judicial finding. From the common law record, we do not know what manner of man the defendant was. Facts bearing on his maturity or capacity of comprehension or on the circumstances under which a plea of guilty was tendered and accepted are wholly wanting. We have only the fact that the trial judge explained what the plea of guilty involved. To be sure, the record does not show that the trial court spelled out with laborious detail the various degrees of homicide under Illinois law and the various defenses open to one accused of murder. But the Constitution of the United States does not require of a judge that he recite with particularity that he performed his duty.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "The only peg on which the defendant seeks to hang a claim that his right to counsel was denied is the fact that the judge did assign him counsel when it came to sentencing. From this fact alone, we are asked to draw the inference that the accused was not capable of understanding the proceedings which led to his plea of guilty, and was therefore deprived of the indispensable assistance of counsel. We cannot take such a jump in reasoning. A trial court may justifiably be convinced that a defendant knows what he is about when he pleads guilty and that he rightly believes that a trial is futile because a defense is wanting. But the imposition of sentence presents quite different considerations. There a judge usually moves within a large area of discretion and doubts. Such is the situation under Illinois law. The range of punishment which a judge in Illinois may impose for murder is between fourteen years and death. It is a commonplace that no more difficult task confronts judges than the determination of punishment not fixed by statute. Even the most self-assured judge may well want to bring to his aid every consideration that counsel for the accused can appropriately urge. In any event, the designation of counsel to assist the accused at the sentencing stage of the prosecution in no wise implies that the defendant was not capable of intelligent self-protection when he pleaded guilty. Cf. Canizio v. People of State of New York, 327 U.S. 82, 66 S.Ct. 452.\n",

      "We conclude that on the record before the Supreme Court of Illinois there was no showing that Carter's plea of guilty was made under circumstanc § which cut the ground from under the resulting sentence. In restricting its review to that record the Supreme Court of Illinois followed local practice, and the practice constitutes allowable State appellate procedure. Factors that might suggest fundamental unfairness in the proceedings before the trial judge—e.g., the racial handicap of the defendant, his mental capacity, his inability to make an intelligent choice, precipitancy in the acceptance of a plea of guilty—are not before us because they were not in the common law record which was all that was before the Supreme Court of Illinois. Whether the defendant is entitled to press such claims to show a denial by the State of Illinois of a constitutional right, it will be time enough to consider when that issue is properly before us after being presented in a proceeding in the State courts appropriate to that purpose, or, if none is available, in a federal court. Woods v. Nierstheimer, supra; Ex parte Hawk, supra.\n",

      "After indicating the restricted scope of review in this proceeding, the court below observed that under Illinois law a defendant who desires counsel must ask for it and show that he cannot afford one of his own choice. There are situations when justice cannot be administered unless persons charged with crime are defended by capable and responsible counsel. But there is nothing in the record before us to indicate that the circumstances made it necessary for Carter to have professional guidance other than that given by the trial court. There is therefore nothing in the statement of the Illinois Supreme Court alone from which we can infer that these normal requirements of Illinois law prejudiced this defendant or made their observance in this case incongruous with his constitutional rights.\n",

      "If, as the opinion of the Court suggests, the Illinois Supreme Court had ruled that petitioner could not raise the question of his right to counsel by reason of the abbreviated common law record, I would agree that the judgment should be affirmed. For then petitioner would be remitted to other state procedures for vindication of his constitutional right. The Illinois Supreme Court rested on that ground when it refused to consider his claim that he was deprived of due process of law by reason of the method of his arrest and the unfairness of the trial. But when it came to consider the question of his right to counsel, the inadequacy of the record was not the ground it gave for barring him from showing that he was unqualified to waive the constitutional right:\n",

      "'His first contention is that the court erred in not appointing an attorney to represent him during arraignment. The right to be represented by counsel is one which the defendant may waive or claim, as he shall determine. No duty rests upon the court to provide legal assistance for an accused, unless he states, under his oath, his inability to procure counsel, and expresses a desire to have the court appoint one for him. (People v. Braner, 389 Ill. 190, 58 N.E.2d 869; People v. Corrie, 387 Ill. 587, 56 N.E.2d 767; People v. Childers, 386 Ill. 312, 53 N.E.2d 878.) There being no bill of exceptions, and it not appearing that plaintiff in error sought to have an attorney appointed for him, this assignment of error cannot be sustained. People v. Stubblefield, (391 Ill. 609), 63 N.E.2d (763, 764); People v. Stack, 391 Ill. 15, 62 N.E.2d 807; People v. Braner, 389 Ill. 190, 58 N.E.2d 869.' 391 Ill. 594, 595; 63 N.E.2d 763, 764.\n",

      "By the rule there announced the record was inadequate only in one respect—the absence of a bill of exceptions showing that petitioner asked that an attorney be appointed for him. But that neglect by a defendant is not fatal, at least in a capital case. If a defendant is not capable of making his own defense, it is the duty of the court to appoint counsel, whether requested so to do or not. Williams v. Kais r, 323 U.S. 471, 476, 65 S.Ct. 363, 89 L.Ed. 398. As we stated in that case, 323 U.S. at pages 475, 476, 65 S.Ct. at page 366, 89 L.Ed. 398:\n",

      "'The decision to plead guilty is a decision to allow a judgment of conviction to be entered without a hearing—a decision which is irrevocable and which forecloses any possibility of establishing innocence. If we assume that petitioner committed a crime, we cannot know the degree of prejudice which the denial of counsel caused. See Glasser v. United States, 315 U.S. 60, 75, 76, 62 S.Ct. 457, 467, 468, 86 L.Ed. 680. Only counsel could discern from the facts whether a plea of not guilty to the offense charged or a plea of guilty to a lesser offense would be appropriate. A layman is usually no match for the skilled prosecutor whom he confronts in the court room. He needs the aid of counsel lest he be the victim of overzealous prosecutors, of the law's complexity, or of his own ignorance or bewilderment.'\n",

If that evidence may be considered in this proceeding, petitioner should prevail. Though the basis of the action of the Illinois Supreme Court be deemed less clear than I have indicated, a remand to it would be appropriate so that any state procedural question may be untangled from the question arising under the federal constitution.

Rather he has been deprived of his freedom for life without the aid of an attorney to guide him along the complicated and twisting labyrinths of the law.

It is said that we are limited to the common law record before the Supreme Court of Illinois, a record that includes only the indictment, the judgment on the plea of guilty, the minute entry bearing on the sentence, and the sentence itself. We are asked to close our eyes to a transcript of testimony in connection with a hearing on mitigation of the offense. This testimony was taken after the conviction. It has been certified, presumably by the stenographer recording the testimony at the hearing, and notarized. It appears in the printed record before this Court. We are also asked to overlook certain information about the petitioner given to the Illinois State Penitentiary by the State's attorney and concurred in by the presiding judge. The State of Illinois does not deny any of these facts; it merely requests that we disregard them as did the Supreme Court of Illinois, that we blind ourselves to what is printed in the record before us.\n",

      "Legal technicalities doubtless afford justification for our pretense of ignoring plain facts before us, facts upon which a man's very life or liberty conceivably could depend. Moreover, there probably is legal warrant for our not remanding the case to the Supreme Court of Illinois to allow those facts to be incorporated in the formal record before it and to consider its decision in light thereof.

But the additional facts do serve to emphasize the absence of an intelligent waiver of counsel and petitioner's failure to comprehend the legal problems placed in his path. They serve to make any decision on the issue in the case more intelligent and more just. The discussion that follows, therefore, is based on all the certified facts in the record before us.\n",

      "Petitioner, a Negro, was 30 years of age at the time of the relevant events in 1928. He had no schooling, although he was able to read and write.

      "While driving a car back from a fishing trip, petitioner became involved in a bitter and prolonged dispute with the driver of a horse-drawn gravel wagon over the right-of-way on a road. This driver, a white man, refused to give petitioner enough room to pass. A violent argument in racial terminology ensued; rocks and gravel were thrown at petitioner's car. Eventually, when the dispute was renewed after a short interval, the driver got off his wagon and advanced toward petitioner's car. Petitioner claimed that he thought the driver was reaching into his shirt for a gun. Petitioner got out of his car and fired three times killing the driver.\n",

      "Petitioner was taken into custody that same evening and was questioned far into the night. He was taken to an adjoining town, allegedly to avoid mob violence. Twelve days later, on June 12, 1928, he was indicted. It was charged that he 'did then and there unlawfully, and feloniously, with malice aforethought, by shooting, kill' the named individual. On June 15 he was arraigned without the benefit of counsel, it being alleged by petitioner that he was held incommunicado from the time of his arrest. He was handed a copy of the five-page indictment, under which he could have been convicted of first-degree murder, lesser degrees of homicide, voluntary or involuntary manslaughter, assault with a deadly weapon, or lesser degrees of assault. Various considerations of defense, including self-defense, were accordingly raised. Upon being asked how he pleaded, he expressed a desire to plead guilty as charged in the indictment. The trial court's order, which bears striking resemblance to the Illinois statute on the subject (Ill.Rev.Stat., 1945, Ch. 38, par. 732), recited that the judge 'fully explained' to petitioner 'the consequences of such plea' and his rights to counsel and to jury trial, but that petitioner 'persists in his desire to plead guilty' as charged. There is no affirmative evidence that petitioner understood the necessary consequences of his plea or that, fully appreciating all of his legal rights, he intelligently waived his rights to counsel or to jury trial. All that appears is that he 'persisted' in his desire to plead guilty and that the court convicted him of murder, the statutory punishment for which was death by electrocution or imprisonment for any period from fourteen years to life.\n",

      "A further hearing was held on the same day and an attorney was appointed, apparently not at petitioner's request, to represent petitioner at a hearing upon the 'question of mitigation or aggravation of said crime of murder to which defendant has pleaded guilty.' Such a hearing was required by state law (Ill.Rev.Stat., 1945, Ch. 38, par. 732) where a guilty plea has been entered and where the court has discretion as to the extent of the punishment. A hearing on this matter was held three days later, on June 18, petitioner's appointed counsel being present. On June 29, in the absence of counsel, petitioner appeared in court and was sentenced to serve 99 years in prison.\n",

      "I do not believe that these facts add up to due process of law. Petitioner, an uneducated, bewildered layman, was allegedly held incommunicado for fifteen days and was the  called upon to make a vital decision upon the basis of his unintelligent understanding of the indictment—a legalistic, verbose document of five pages which would doubtless mean many things to many learned lawyers in light of the particular facts involved. Petitioner's very life and liberty depended upon his ability to comprehend the variety of crimes covered by the indictment and which one, if any, applied to the facts of his case. He was compelled to weigh the factors involved in a guilty plea against those resulting from the submission of his case to a jury. He was forced to judge the chances of setting up a successful defense. These are all complicated matters that only a man versed in the legal lore could hope to comprehend and to decide intelligently. Petitioner obviously was not of that type. Yet at this crucial juncture petitioner lacked the aid and guidance of such a person. In my view, it is a gross miscarriage of justice to condemn a man to death or to life imprisonment in such a manner. See Powell v. State of Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 53 S.Ct. 55, 77 L.Ed. 158, 84 A.L.R. 527; Williams v. Kaiser, 323 U.S. 471, 65 S.Ct. 363, 89 L.Ed. 398; Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786, 65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367.\n",

      "It is said, of course, that petitioner waived his right to counsel. My answer is that such action is immaterial in a capital case of this nature without affirmative evidence of an intelligent waiver. Such evidence is non-existent here, even looking solely at the common law record. Its absence becomes even more emphasized when we view the background of ignorance, racial antagonism and threats of mob violence. When the life of a man hangs in the balance, we should insist upon the fullest measure of due process. Society is here attempting to take away the life or liberty of one of its members. That attempt must be tested by the highest standards of justice and fairness that we know. It is no excuse that the individual is willing to forego certain basic rights unless we are certain that he has a full and intelligent comprehension of what he is doing. Otherwise we take from due process of law a substantial part of its content.\n",

      "Nor is it significant that counsel was appointed for petitioner to represent him at the hearing as to the mitigation of the offense. The error was done, the damage was committed, when petitioner was arraigned, compelled to plead and convicted without the assistance of counsel. The special hearing on mitigation held thereafter, for which counsel was provided, afforded no opportunity for undoing the effect of the unaided arraignment or plea of guilty. Cf. Canizio v. People of State of New York, 327 U.S. 82, 66 S.Ct. 452. The failure to have counsel in regard to those matters permeated the entire proceeding, with indelible effects that could not be removed at the special hearing.

      " Justice MARTINEZ delivered the Opinion of the Court.\n",
      "I. Introduction\n",
      " The People appeal the court of appeals' determination that Allen Charles Bergerud was denied his constitutional right to counsel and so is entitled a new trial. See People v. Bergerud, 203 P.3d 579 (Colo.App.2008).\n",
      " Bergerud was charged with two counts of first degree murder. His court-appointed lawyers indicated in their opening statements that they would endeavor to show that Bergerud — due to various medical and psychological conditions as well as high levels of intoxication — had not acted with deliberation in killing the two victims, and so should not be convicted of first degree murder. Upon hearing these opening statements, Bergerud\n",
      "requested new counsel on the basis that his attorneys refused to pursue and present the self-defense theory he desired. The trial court denied his motion, and Bergerud elected to proceed to trial pro se in order to argue his theory of self-defense. He was subsequently convicted.\n",
      " On appeal, Bergerud claimed the content of his lawyers' opening statements and the denial of his motion for substitute counsel violated his constitutional right to representation. The court of appeals, reasoning that his lawyers' statements to the jury were tantamount to a guilty plea to lesser homicide offenses over Bergerud's objection, remanded the case for a new trial. We granted the People's petition for certiorari to consider whether Bergerud's right to counsel had been improperly denied.1\n",
      " Because Bergerud decided to proceed pro se after voicing his disagreement with his court-appointed attorneys, the central question before us is whether Bergerud's waiver of his right to counsel was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary. That question in turn depends on whether his attorneys' trial decisions violated Bergerud's trial rights, thus forcing him to choose between his right to counsel and protecting other rights associated with his defense, such as the choice to testify or enter a plea of not guilty. Although defense counsel is free to develop defense theories based on reasonable assessments of the evidence, as guided by her professional judgment, she cannot usurp those fundamental choices given directly to criminal defendants by the United States and Colorado Constitutions. Although we conclude that Bergerud's lawyers did not violate his right to enter a plea, it is unclear on the record before us whether they wholly deprived him of his right to testify, or if they failed in their duty to investigate possible defenses due to a complete breakdown in communications. Either such violation would have undermined the voluntary nature of Bergerud's waiver of his right to counsel.\n",
      " Accordingly, we reverse the opinion of the court of appeals and direct further specific inquiries consistent with this opinion.\n",
      "II. Facts and Procedural Posture\n",
      " Bergerud was charged with capital murder for killing his ex-girlfriend and her male companion, as well as two counts of first degree assault on a police officer. During the incident, Bergerud shot both victims, and then exchanged gunfire with police officers before being shot in the hand, apprehended, and placed under arrest.\n",
      " At the first of what would be two trials, Bergerud's hired attorney argued that Bergerud had not acted with the requisite mental state of deliberation and so could not be convicted of first degree murder. To this end, defense counsel highlighted Bergerud's very low IQ test scores and his intoxicated state at the time of the killings. The jury was not given instructions concerning lesser included offenses. Faced with an all-or-nothing choice between conviction for first degree murder or acquittal, the jury was unable to reach a consensus. It was dismissed as deadlocked after several days of deliberations.\n",
      " Subsequently, the prosecution withdrew its request for the death penalty. Bergerud's original attorney was excused as Bergerud could no longer afford his fees, and the court appointed Bergerud new counsel. Prior to the beginning of his second trial, the trial court held several hearings on pre-trial motions where it was apparent that court-appointed counsel intended to adopt a similar trial strategy to that employed in the first trial. During voir dire, Bergerud's new attorneys continued to focus on evidence related to his mental state at the time of the killings, concentrating on jury members' history with mental illness and addiction, and\n",
      "asking about their ability to take evidence of those things into account when making their final determination.\n",
      " Also consistent with this choice of defense, the opening statements offered by Bergerud's new attorneys at the beginning of the second trial focused largely on Bergerud's low IQ, his diabetes, and his intoxicated state at the time of the killings. Additionally, his lawyer stated that Bergerud was so confused he likely did not know or accurately remember what happened on the night of the killings. After opening statements, Bergerud requested that he be allowed to talk to the judge.\n",
      " In chambers, Bergerud stated that he wanted to fire his attorneys because they refused to develop and present his defense as he requested and asked that a new opening statement be given. The trial court, upon hearing of the disagreement between Bergerud and his attorneys, suspended the trial to allow adequate time to investigate the matter. The trial court then excused the prosecuting attorneys for the afternoon while it held a series of in camera proceedings to inquire into the nature of the conflict between Bergerud and his lawyers. Bergerud explained that his first attorney had written him a letter lamenting the choice not to pursue a theory of self-defense. Trusting his first attorney's determination, Bergerud gave the letter to his court-appointed counsel for his second trial and asked them to present self-defense. According to Bergerud, his new attorneys refused to pursue the theory as it would \"take too much work\" to develop it. Bergerud complained that his attorneys were \"not listening to the information that [he gave] them\" and that they were \"paying no attention to what [he was] telling them happened that night.\"\n",
      " Bergerud's attorneys, though given the opportunity during these proceedings, never commented on the nature of their disagreement with their client nor gave an account of their reasoning on pertinent issues concerning the development of Bergerud's defense. They merely clarified that they did not intend, at that time, to move to withdraw as Bergerud's attorneys.\n",
      " The trial court advised Bergerud that he was free to testify as to his recollection of the events, and that if evidence were presented to the jury regarding self-defense, the trial court would give the jury an instruction on that defense theory. However, whenever Bergerud conferred with his attorneys off the record, he told the court \"they can't help me\" once the proceedings had resumed. Bergerud repeatedly told the court he wanted assistance from new counsel, but that he would represent himself if \"that's what [he had] to do\" in order to present his desired self-defense theory.\n",
      " The trial court found that Bergerud's disagreement with his lawyers did not amount to a complete breakdown in communications, but was rather a disagreement about trial strategies that were properly left in the hands of counsel. Moreover, finding that Bergerud's request was not timely and that further delay would inconvenience witnesses, the trial court denied his request for new counsel and found that appointing advisory counsel was not practicable. The trial court thus gave Bergerud the option of either proceeding with his court-appointed attorneys or proceeding pro se. Bergerud stated that he would continue pro se. Knowing that Bergerud's decision was based on his desire to pursue his theory of self-defense, the trial court invited the prosecuting attorneys back into the meeting and directed Bergerud to tell them of his self-defense plan in order to resolve any objection they might raise to the presentation of self-defense prior to finalizing Bergerud's decision. The prosecuting attorneys stated that they did not object to Bergerud presenting a self-defense theory — though the statutory deadline for notifying prosecutors of that plan had come and gone — only if Bergerud decided to proceed without counsel. Bergerud subsequently reaffirmed his choice to proceed pro se.\n",
      " After the trial, the jury convicted Bergerud on one count of first degree murder, one count of second degree murder, and two counts of first degree assault on a police officer. The trial court sentenced Bergerud to life in prison for first degree murder, forty-eight years in prison for second degree murder, and thirty-two years in prison for\n",
      "each assault, all sentences to be served consecutively.\n",
      " On appeal, Bergerud argued that the content of his attorney's opening statements, as well as the trial court's denial of his request for new counsel, violated his constitutional right to representation. The court of appeals reasoned that, by focusing solely and strongly on Bergerud's alleged inability to formulate the requisite mental state for first degree murder, Bergerud's attorneys had effectively conceded his guilt to lesser homicide offenses despite Bergerud's desire to defend against the charges and seek acquittal. The court of appeals concluded that Bergerud enjoyed a fundamental choice regarding election of a defense theory that would seek acquittal, a choice that Bergerud had been denied, and so reversed the trial court's order and remanded the case for a new trial.\n",
      " The People petitioned this court to review the court of appeals' determination, arguing that Bergerud enjoyed no such fundamental choice when it came to the election of defense theories. We granted certiorari and now reverse the court of appeals.\n",
      "III. The Right to Counsel\n",
      "A. De Novo Review\n",
      " The United States and Colorado Constitutions extend an indigent criminal defendant the right to representation. See U.S. Const. amends. VI, XIV; Colo. Const. art. II, § 16. Before proceeding pro se, a defendant must knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive his constitutional right to counsel. People v. Arguello, 772 P.2d 87, 93 (Colo.1989). \"Effective waiver of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law that we review de novo.\" People v. Alengi, 148 P.3d 154, 159 (Colo.2006). Where a trial court determines that substitute counsel is not warranted, \"the court can insist that the defendant choose between continued representation by existing counsel and appearing pro se.\" Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94. However, where his attorney's actions were constitutionally deficient and the trial court nonetheless improperly denied the defendant's request for new counsel, such a choice effectively forces a defendant to sacrifice one or more of his trial rights. See People v. Campbell, 58 P.3d 1148, 1157-58 (Colo.App. 2002) (impermissible choice between proceeding pro se and proceeding with allegedly ineffective counsel). A defendant's waiver of his right to counsel cannot be considered effective if it is executed under the pretense of an impermissible choice between constitutionally protected rights. See, e.g., Pazden v. Maurer, 424 F.3d 303, 313 (3d Cir.2005) (\"If a choice presented to a petitioner is constitutionally offensive, then the choice cannot be voluntary.\" (internal quotations omitted)). Thus, when a defendant elects to proceed pro se after failing to obtain substitute counsel, we must review the trial court's denial of the defendant's request de novo in order to assess whether the defendant's subsequent waiver of his right to counsel was voluntarily made.\n",
      "B. Limitations on Counsel's Authority\n",
      " Although the defendant remains ever the master of his defense while the attorney's role is that of an assistant, Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), the right to an attorney is not a right to a mouthpiece or marionette, but rather to competent counsel who will employ her own professional expertise in effectively representing her client's interests, see People v. Schultheis, 638 P.2d 8, 12 (Colo.1981). \"[W]hen a defendant chooses to have a lawyer manage and present his case, law and tradition may allocate to the counsel the power to make binding decisions of trial strategy in many areas.\" Faretta, 422 U.S. at 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525. On issues of trial strategy, defense counsel is \"captain of the ship.\" Arko v. People, 183 P.3d 555, 558 (Colo.2008).\n",
      " However, there are three important sources of limitations on a defense attorney's ability to direct the course of a trial. First, certain constitutional rights are given directly to the defendant and cannot be wielded by an attorney representative. See Faretta, 422 U.S. at 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525. Decisions such as whether to plead guilty, whether to testify, whether to waive a jury trial, or whether to take an appeal are so fundamental to a defense\n",
      "that they cannot be made by defense counsel, but rather must be made by the defendant himself. See Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745, 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983).\n",
      " Second, it is axiomatic that a trial is a truth-seeking endeavor, and so lawyers are restricted from taking actions that would contravene that purpose. See Schultheis, 638 P.2d at 12. Principal among these restrictions, counsel's representations cannot be based on falsified evidence or perjured testimony. See Nix v. Whiteside, 475 U.S. 157, 166, 106 S.Ct. 988, 89 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986); Colo. RPC 3.3. \"If there is no bona fide defense to the charge, counsel cannot create one and may disserve the interests of his client by attempting a useless charade.\" United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 656, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 n.9 (1984). Furthermore, attorneys should not labor under conflicts of interest or a complete breakdown in communications with their clients that prevent them from putting on an adequate defense. See Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94.\n",
      " The \"decisions of trial strategy\" available to defense attorneys are therefore those bound on the one side by the fundamental choices given directly to the defendant by the Constitution, and on the other by the requirements of honesty and integrity imposed on officers of the court. The third source of limitations on an attorney's actions is that these decisions of trial strategy are held to a standard of professional reasonableness. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Without some ability to review an attorney's allegedly unreasonable decisions, the right to counsel would be a hollow promise. Even so, the principal concern when faced with the allegedly unreasonable decisions of defense counsel is whether those actions undermined the reliability of the result of the proceeding. See id. at 691, 696, 104 S.Ct. 2052; see also Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002).\n",
      "C. Appropriate Test\n",
      " Bergerud contends that his decision to proceed pro se was based on an ineffective waiver of his right to counsel. If a defendant waives his right to counsel and elects to proceed pro se only because he was improperly denied other trial rights, his waiver will not be considered effective. See Campbell, 58 P.3d at 1157. Thus, in order to determine whether Bergerud knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to an attorney, we must assess the propriety of the choice with which he was presented by the trial court and his lawyers.2 That, in turn, depends on the nature of the dispute underlying Bergerud's request for new counsel and whether the trial court properly denied that request.\n",
      " Deciding whether a defendant is entitled to substitute counsel requires an inquiry laden with factual determinations; thus, \"when an indigent defendant voices objections to court-appointed counsel, the trial court has the obligation to inquire into the reasons for the dissatisfaction.\" Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94; see also Garcia, 64 P.3d at 863. Before a substitution of counsel is warranted, the court must establish that the defendant has \"some well founded reason for believing that the appointed attorney cannot or will not completely represent him.\" Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94 (quotations omitted). In performing such an inquiry, a court may inquire as to pertinent details of a disagreement between a defendant and counsel without infringing on the attorney-client privilege. Id. Indeed, \"inquiry into counsel's conversations with the defendant may be critical to a proper assessment of counsel's ... litigation decisions.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \"Unless the complaint underlying a request for substitution of counsel is sufficiently detailed, the court may not rule on the motion without conducting a proper hearing at which both attorney and client testify as to the nature of their conflict.\" United States v. Zillges,\n",
      "978 F.2d 369, 372 (7th Cir.1992) (emphasis added, internal quotations omitted).\n",
      " As a threshold matter, a court should determine the type of limitation on counsel that is implicated by the defendant's request in order to locate the dispute within the landscape of Sixth Amendment precedent and properly assess any constitutional concerns. Here, Bergerud's complaint against his court-appointed attorneys implicated his rights to enter a plea and to testify in his own defense. Thus, his request for new counsel was, at least in part, a request to exercise rights that were committed to his determination alone and could not be usurped by his attorneys' strategic decisions. See Barnes, 463 U.S. at 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308. Were his attorneys to have overstepped their authority and effectively prevented Bergerud from making the fundamental choices extended to him by the Constitution, or had they indicated that his decisions on these matters would not be dutifully followed, Bergerud's choice between proceeding pro se and continuing with counsel would have been \"constitutionally offensive\" because it would have effectively forced a choice between his right to counsel and other of his trial rights. See Maurer, 424 F.3d at 313; Wilks v. Israel, 627 F.2d 32, 35 (7th Cir.1980). In such a case, proceeding pro se would have been the only way to protect his decisions to testify and to plead not guilty. Bergerud also alleged that the disagreement with counsel amounted to a complete breakdown in communications that had inhibited the development of an adequate defense.\n",
      " In evaluating a defendant's request for new counsel, a court must consider the \"need for orderly and expeditious administration of justice\" in addition to the \"particular facts underlying the defendant's request for new counsel.\" People ex rel. M.M., 726 P.2d 1108, 1121 (Colo.1986) (citing People v. Rubanowitz, 688 P.2d 231, 242-43 (Colo. 1984)). In order to measure the constitutional implications of a defendant's request for new counsel, other courts have directed a three-factor inquiry into (1) the timeliness of the motion, (2) the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and (3) whether the attorney-client conflict is so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication or otherwise prevented an adequate defense. See, e.g., United States v. Simeonov, 252 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir.2001) (citing United States v. Gallop, 838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988); United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.1986); United States v. Whaley, 788 F.2d 581, 583 (9th Cir.1986)). The Tenth Circuit appends a fourth factor to this test, examining the extent to which the defendant \"substantially and unreasonably contributed\" to the underlying conflict with his attorney. United States v. Lott, 310 F.3d 1231, 1250-51 (10th Cir.2002).\n",
      " Taken together, these four factors capture the considerations we have set forth in our precedent and appropriately direct both a trial court's initial inquiry as well as appellate review.3 The first and fourth factors ensure that a defendant does not use requests for new counsel to unnecessarily delay the judicial process. See United States v. John Doe No. 1, 272 F.3d 116, 122 (2d Cir.2001) (noting that \"once trial has begun, a defendant has no unbridled right to reject assigned counsel and demand another\" and stating that \"courts must impose restraints on the right to reassignment of counsel in order to avoid the defendant's manipulation of the right\" (internal quotations omitted)). A court's determination on timeliness should not only consider whether the defendant's request was late in coming, and so would seriously inconvenience witnesses or otherwise disrupt the orderly administration of justice, but should also establish the cause for any delay and whether responsibility for the delay lies with the defendant or with his lawyers.\n",
      " The second factor recognizes the importance of the facts underlying the defendant's dispute with counsel to an ultimate determination on the matter, and captures this court's concern regarding the adequacy of\n",
      "the record when reviewing the constitutional implications of a defendant's request for new counsel. See, e.g., Ardolino v. People, 69 P.3d 73, 77 (Colo.2003); see also People v. Kelling, 151 P.3d 650, 655 (Colo.App.2006).\n",
      " The third factor focuses on the underlying constitutional concern: whether the disagreement or communication breakdown inhibits the presentation of an adequate defense or the defendant's complete representation by counsel. See Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.S. 364, 370, 113 S.Ct. 838, 122 L.Ed.2d 180 (1993) (explaining that Supreme Court precedent has \"emphasized that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial\" (internal quotations omitted)). The presentation of an \"adequate defense\" requires, at least in part, the defense have the \"personal character upon which the [Constitution] insists,\" Faretta, 422 U.S. at 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525, and so maintain fidelity to the defendant's decisions on those fundamental choices committed to his determination alone, see Barnes, 463 U.S. at 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308.\n",
      " Finally, where, having been erroneously denied his request for new counsel, a defendant proceeds with his court-appointed attorneys,4 the error will generally be examined for prejudice or under principles of harmless error before a new trial is ordered. See Mickens, 535 U.S. at 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237 (\"As a general matter, a defendant alleging a Sixth Amendment violation must demonstrate `a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.'\" (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052)); Lott, 310 F.3d at 1250-53 (approving harmless-error analysis for claims of complete breakdown in communications where defendant remained represented by counsel). However, where, as here, a defendant elects to proceed pro se after voicing a grievance against his attorneys, any violation of his Sixth Amendment rights would result in a complete denial of his right to counsel. Such complete violations constitute structural errors in the trial process and warrant a new trial.5 See Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 309-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991) (absence of counsel from beginning to end of trial defies analysis by \"harmless-error\" standards (citing Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963))).\n",
      "IV. Analysis\n",
      " In order to evaluate Bergerud's waiver of his right to counsel, we must determine whether the choice given him to either proceed pro se or continue with his existing attorneys impermissibly forced him to choose between his right to counsel and other rights associated with his defense. To that end, we must examine the nature of the underlying dispute between Bergerud and his attorneys and its impact on other of Bergerud's trial rights.\n",
      " Though represented by counsel at the time, Bergerud, like most defendants in his position, was effectively proceeding pro se during his request for new counsel. See, e.g., Kelling, 151 P.3d at 657 (an attorney cannot be expected to present his own ineffectiveness). As such, Bergerud's allegations underlying the request will be broadly construed to ensure he is not denied review of important constitutional issues simply for his inability to articulate his concerns within the\n",
      "legal lexicon. See, e.g., Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972) (holding the allegations of a pro se defendant to \"less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers\"); Dluhos v. Strasberg, 321 F.3d 365, 369 (3d Cir.2003) (stating the court must liberally construe a pro se complaint and \"apply the applicable law, irrespective of whether the pro se litigant has mentioned it by name\"); Marmolejo v. United States, 196 F.3d 377, 378 (2d Cir.1999) (per curiam) (the papers of pro se litigants are construed liberally).6\n",
      " The record surrounding Bergerud's request for substitute counsel exposes three concerns regarding the effectiveness of his waiver of counsel. First, and as emphasized by the court of appeals, there is a concern that, by focusing on his mental state, Bergerud's attorneys effectively pled him guilty to lesser homicide crimes against his wishes. Second, Bergerud's attorneys may have wholly undermined his ability to testify in his own defense by stating Bergerud did not know himself what happened on the night of the killings. In either event, Bergerud's attorneys would have overstepped their bounds and appropriated fundamental choices committed to the defendant's decision alone. Third, Bergerud argued that the conflict with his attorneys concerning whether to pursue a theory of self-defense resulted in a complete breakdown in communications and implied that his attorneys had failed to investigate his desired self-defense theory.\n",
      " We review each of these concerns about the effectiveness of Bergerud's waiver of counsel in turn, guided by our consideration for the orderly administration of justice, the adequacy of the record, and the extent and cause of the breakdown in communications, as set forth above in our four-factor test. The timeliness of the motion — unlike the other factors of our four-factor test — applies identically to each concern, and so we discuss that factor first. We determine that, although Bergerud's request for new counsel was not timely, it is unclear on the record whether the delay is attributable to Bergerud or to his attorneys. Proceeding to address each of the concerns under the remaining three factors of the test, we conclude Bergerud's right to enter a plea was not violated by his attorney's opening statements. As to the other two concerns, though, the record is insufficient for us to determine if Bergerud's attorneys impermissibly constrained his trial rights, and thereby undermined the voluntary character of his waiver of his right to counsel. As such, we remand this case for further consistent proceedings.\n",
      "A. Timeliness of the Request\n",
      " The trial court found that the defendant's motion for new counsel was not timely. Although we agree, the reason for the delay is not in the record.\n",
      " It is exceedingly difficult for a trial court to adequately address conflicts between a defendant and counsel when the jury is waiting in the next room for the trial to proceed. \"When a defendant makes an untimely request for new counsel on the eve of trial or under circumstances which are likely to result in a continuance, the judge must carefully inquire into the defendant's reasons for the request to determine whether they are sufficiently substantial to justify postponing the trial.\" Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94. The months invested in preparing for the trial, and the burdens already placed on the lives of witnesses, should not be lightly tossed aside once the trial has begun. As such, both the defendant and his attorneys have an obligation to bring conflicts to the attention of the court at the earliest practicable time, lest requests for new counsel or time to resolve such conflicts be used to obstruct the orderly administration of justice. See, e.g., John Doe No. 1, 272 F.3d at 122. Of course, a defendant's conduct is often bridled by an impression that he must engage a court through his lawyers. As such, a defendant will be held to have discharged his\n",
      "duty where he makes a reasonable effort to bring the matter to the court's attention.\n",
      " During the six months leading up to the trial, the trial court held several hearings on pre-trial motions, with Bergerud present, at which Bergerud's court-appointed attorneys examined potential trial witnesses. In doing so, his attorneys clearly indicated that their central concern at trial would be evidence relating to Bergerud's intoxication and mental state at the time of the killings. Furthermore, during the four days of voir dire immediately prior to trial, the questions posed by Bergerud's attorneys to prospective jury members focused almost exclusively on their ability to consider such evidence. Bergerud should have known the disagreement with his counsel had not been resolved prior to opening statements.\n",
      " However, Bergerud alleges that he repeatedly asked his attorneys to change their approach, that he stated he needed new attorneys if they were not willing to pursue the self-defense theory, and that he was \"surprised\" by the opening statements. According to Bergerud's unrefuted account, he thought the disagreement with his attorneys had been resolved and that they had agreed to go forward with a theory of self-defense. On this account, it appears less that Bergerud was late in raising his concerns and more that his lawyers were late in bringing them to the attention of the trial court. If Bergerud was as relentless as he insists in demanding that his lawyers present his self-defense theory, his lawyers should have alerted the court to the disagreement before the trial began, especially in light of how the election of a defense theory here presupposes decisions as to certain of Bergerud's fundamental choices. \"If a disagreement on significant matters of tactics or strategy arises between defense counsel and the client, defense counsel should make a record of the circumstances, counsel's advice and reasons, and the conclusion reached.\" ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function and Defense Function § 4-5.2(c) (3d ed.1993).7 Of further concern, when his attorneys did inform the trial court that Bergerud wished to speak with the court regarding his representation, their comments indicate Bergerud may have asked to do so before.\n",
      " On the other hand, his attorneys' failure to raise the issue before the court, and their comment that they were not \"prepared\" to call the disagreement a breakdown in communications, indicate that perhaps Bergerud was less persistent than he alleges, or that his attorneys had thought the matter resolved against presentation of the self-defense theory. Additionally, some of Bergerud's statements in those proceedings cast doubt on his ability to understand what the self-defense theory entailed.8 It may well be that Bergerud should bear some or even most of the blame for the lateness of the motion for new counsel, but as it stands, counsel's reticence to discuss the disagreement with the court inhibits such a conclusion. Without more, these inferences cannot overcome Bergerud's account of the dispute; the lateness of Bergerud's request for new counsel cannot, on the existing record, be held against him.\n",
      " Any request for new counsel that is made once the trial has begun puts a trial court in a difficult position. Here, if Bergerud was surprised by his lawyer's opening statements, despite these concerns for the orderly\n",
      "administration of justice, the timing of his request for new counsel cannot override the other factors of our review.9\n",
      "B. Right to Enter a Plea\n",
      " Bergerud contends that, when presented with the choice between presenting the self-defense theory or proceeding with counsel, he was impermissibly forced to choose between two fundamental constitutional rights: the right to counsel and the right to enter a plea of not guilty and so require prosecutors to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. See Cronic, 466 U.S. at 657 n. 19, 104 S.Ct. 2039 (\"[E]ven when no theory of defense is available, if the decision to stand trial has been made, counsel must hold the prosecution to its heavy burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt.\"). This argument relies on the proposition that his lawyer's opening statements were tantamount to a guilty plea or a judicial admission, relieving the prosecution of its burden of proof — at least with respect to some of the lesser homicide offenses. Only if the opening statement effectively foreclosed later arguments for outright acquittal would the two options pose the intractable dilemma that Bergerud claims. See Arko v. People, 183 P.3d 555, 558 (Colo.2008) (distinguishing between requests that a jury consider lesser included offenses and guilty pleas by noting that, in the case of the former, a defendant \"retains the opportunity to advocate for outright acquittal\").\n",
      " The court of appeals concluded that the contentious opening statements were the equivalent of a guilty plea, and so the options posed to Bergerud by the trial court impermissibly required him to choose between two constitutional rights to which he should have been entitled. We disagree. Because this issue stems from the content of the opening statements alone, nothing beyond the transcript of those statements is needed to support our final determination on the matter. After examining the opening statements carefully and considering them in context, we conclude they did not act as a concession of Bergerud's guilt.10\n",
      " The right to enter a plea is one of those fundamental choices that must be decided by the defendant alone. See Barnes, 463 U.S. at 751, 103 S.Ct. 3308. Counsel cannot concede the defendant's guilt to a crime over his express objection, thereby waiving his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination.11 See Boykin v. Alabama, 395\n",
      "U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); see also Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 4-7, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966) (holding defense counsel's agreement to a truncated trial was the \"equivalent of a guilty plea\" and so required the defendant's consent).\n",
      " However, in order to distinguish them from flourishes of argument meant to highlight certain points for the jury, such a concession must rise to the level of judicial admissions before they will be deemed violative of the defendant's rights. \"A judicial admission is a formal, deliberate declaration which a party or his attorney makes in a judicial proceeding for the purpose of dispensing with proof of formal matters or of facts about which there is no real dispute.\" People v. Bertagnolli, 861 P.2d 717, 720 (Colo.1993) (quoting Kempter v. Hurd, 713 P.2d 1274, 1279 (Colo.1986)). Further, a judicial admission acts as evidence against the party making it and may \"constitute the basis of a verdict.\" Gordon v. Benson, 925 P.2d 775, 781 (Colo.1996) (quoting Larson v. A.T.S.I., 859 P.2d 273, 275 (Colo.App.1993)).12 In assessing whether a disputed statement constitutes a judicial admission, the statements should be read as a whole and understood in light of their context. Gordon, 925 P.2d at 781; see also D.R. Horton, Inc.-Denver v. Bischof & Coffman Const., LLC, 217 P.3d 1262, 1276-79 (Colo.App.2009).\n",
      " Here, although focusing exclusively on a \"toxicology and mental impairment\" defense, the opening statements given by one of Bergerud's lawyers stopped short of a concession of guilt on any element of the charged crimes. Bergerud's lawyer began her opening by stating, \"What happened on April 7, 2002 was horrible. It was violent, and it was tragic. But it was not first degree murder after deliberation.\" Following this introduction, Bergerud's lawyer stated she would \"be concentrating on the mental state elements that the prosecution is required to prove in this case.\" She asked a rhetorical question to frame the rest of her opening statement: \"[W]hat evidence will you hear that will help you decide the mental state of Allen Bergerud on April 7th?\" She then answered her question, outlining at length the various evidence defense counsel would present that would weigh against a finding of deliberation: his \"brain dysfunction,\" brittle diabetes, mental health issues, depression, low IQ scores, and high level of intoxication. No other kind of evidence or defense theory was mentioned. Bergerud's lawyer concluded by stating, \"[A]t the end of this case [defense counsel] will ask you to find him not guilty of charges that require intent and after deliberation.\"\n",
      " Given their placement in the opening statements — which are neither evidence themselves, nor do they constrain later argument or introduction of evidence — we conclude, contrary to the court of appeals, that the comments made by defense counsel did not here rise to the level of judicial admissions of Bergerud's guilt; the opening statement was not the equivalent of a guilty plea. Nothing in these statements excused prosecutors\n",
      "from meeting their burden of proof with respect to the elements of the crime charged, nor closed the door on defense counsel later asking for Bergerud's outright acquittal. See Arko, 183 P.3d at 558. A choice to proceed with counsel would not have been a choice to plead guilty to any element of the charged crimes.\n",
      "C. Right to Testify\n",
      " In his comments to the trial court, Bergerud complained that \"[t]he opening statement that was given yesterday is damaging towards a self-defense case.\" Throughout its inquiries into his dispute with counsel, the trial court responded to Bergerud's concerns that the opening statements were \"damaging\" by assuring Bergerud that he could testify as to his own recollection of the events. Bergerud's consistent response to this invitation was that his lawyers would not help him. He repeatedly stated that, if the trial court denied his request for new counsel, he had \"no other choice\" than to appear pro se in order to present his theory of self-defense. His comments strongly suggest that Bergerud believed he could not testify as he desired, notwithstanding the trial court's advisements to the contrary. The thrust of his comments indicates he believed his attorneys would completely contradict his testimony, were he to offer it.\n",
      " This court has long held that \"the decision whether a defendant should exercise his right to testify [is] one of such compelling importance that it is excluded from the group of constitutionally based rights that defense counsel can elect to exercise or waive on the behalf of the accused.\" People v. Curtis, 681 P.2d 504, 512 (Colo.1984). As we noted in Curtis, \"whether or not it improves the defendant's chances of acquittal, his desire to tell his side in a public forum may be of overriding importance to him.... The wisdom or unwisdom of the defendant's choice does not diminish his right to make it.\" Id. at 513 (internal quotations omitted); see also Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 52-53, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 97 L.Ed.2d 37 (1987) (describing the origins and importance of a defendant's right to testify). As with his right to enter a plea, if Bergerud's attorneys impermissibly waived his right to testify, then Bergerud would have been presented with an impermissible choice to either testify or proceed with counsel.\n",
      " As a threshold matter, it must be noted that the option the trial court presented to Bergerud was not the ultimatum it has been characterized to be by the parties and the court of appeals. Rather, the court took pains to ensure the defendant knew he could present his testimony and get a jury instruction on self-defense even with his attorneys' continued representation. Early in the proceedings, the court advised Bergerud:\n",
      "[Y]ou have the right to testify; no one, including your attorneys, can prevent [you from] testifying, so if you have a theory of the case that you wish to advance, you can testify about that at the-at an appropriate time when it's your time to present evidence.\n",
      " The trial court repeated this sentiment three more times before accepting Bergerud's decision to proceed pro se as final.\n",
      " Although certainly true as a matter of law, the trial court's proposal likely seemed a hollow offer because, in her opening statement, one of Bergerud's lawyers had undercut the value of any testimony Bergerud may have provided. She stated:\n",
      "Allen Bergerud was not thinking clearly that night. In fact, he was so out of it, so hasty, so impulsive, that at times it becomes hard to even understand what happened out there. Allen Bergerud himself today cannot believe what happened out there. And it may be that Mr. Bergerud doesn't know how things happened out there, or that he's convinced himself otherwise.\n",
      " (Emphasis added). She went on to note that, when the officers pulled Bergerud from his truck after their fire fight, Bergerud said \"the man in the truck shot me. And clearly to everyone who was there, that is not what had just happened.\" Bergerud's lawyer also emphasized that his medical conditions inhibited his perceptions, and in her conclusion she stated that Bergerud \"broke,\" that he \"lost it,\" that he \"reach[ed] his breaking point,\" and then did \"something catastrophic.\"\n",
      "The one time in the course of her opening statements that Bergerud's lawyer mentioned anything related to his claim of self-defense, she painted it as beyond belief, stating:\n",
      "[T]he paramedics will tell you ... they felt [Bergerud] might be in pain because of the injuries to his hand and they gave him morphine. And instead of that sedating him or calming him down, he becomes talkative, talks about [the victims], they were out to get him, they came to get him. [The male victim] had gone to mess with him at the lake, and he's making these statements that just don't seem to correlate with what the officers viewed in the field that night.\n",
      " These comments are not only in tension with the substance of Bergerud's desired testimony, they attack the very believability of that testimony before it is given and cast his account of the night's events as absurd and a figment of his imagination. The right to testify would be empty indeed were it permissible for the defendant's lawyer to instruct the jury to ignore everything the defendant says. To allow such would be to strip the defense of the \"personal character upon which the [Constitution] insists.\" Faretta, 422 U.S. at 820, 95 S.Ct. 2525.\n",
      " Notwithstanding these concerns, we do not consider indirect comments made during opening statements, by themselves, to be of such importance that they can immediately trigger a violation of the defendant's right to testify. However, the strength of these comments — and the fact that Bergerud contends he made his attorneys aware of his desire to pursue a claim of self-defense months before the trial began — cannot be brushed aside. Taken as an indication of their intent throughout trial, it appears from the opening statement that Bergerud's lawyers would have completely contradicted his self-defense testimony, and indeed may have wholly undermined his right to testify by arguing not only that his testimony was inaccurate, but that anything Bergerud may have said cannot be believed due to his mental state at the time of the killings. Defense attorneys must often begin a trial without knowing whether their client will exercise his right to testify. In such situations, it is the defense attorney's constitutional duty to present arguments in such a way that will leave that door open to the defendant. That is not to say that the defendant can mandate, through his desire to testify, that his attorneys adopt specific trial strategies. Nor do we mean that counsel's actions cannot be in tension with the substance of the defendant's desired testimony: it is permissible for an attorney to adopt trial strategies that effectively argue in the alternative to the thrust of the defendant's testimony. Rather, defense counsel cannot, through their trial actions, reduce their client's constitutional right to a nullity.\n",
      " Here, it is clear, at least from Bergerud's unrefuted account, that his attorneys should have known he wished to testify. Further coloring this concern are Bergerud's comments to the trial court that, to the best of his understanding, his lawyers would not argue the self-defense theory. Moreover, at various times throughout the proceedings, the trial court provided Bergerud with an opportunity to continue discussions with his attorneys off the record. Each time, upon reconvening, Bergerud forcefully stated that he wanted to \"go with\" self-defense, and that his attorneys had stated they \"could not help\" him. Finally, even the trial court admitted that it did not know \"what [Bergerud's] lawyers would do with [self-defense] evidence\" if it were presented.\n",
      " Bergerud's attorneys, though given ample opportunity, never commented on any substantive aspect of their disagreement with their client. Apparently uncomfortable arguing for either result on the question of whether their client should receive new counsel, they declined to speak on the matter, or even to brief the issue to the trial court to help inform the court's decision. Their reticence was unwarranted and ultimately inhibits our review.\n",
      " We are sensitive to the fact that the trial court's inquiry concerned a then on-going attorney-client relationship (as opposed to an inquiry concerning an ineffective assistance claim brought on a post-conviction motion), and that it is difficult for counsel,\n",
      "mindful of their obligations of client confidentiality, to reveal details of their relationship with the defendant. However, those obligations must yield to the court's need to investigate the nature of the attorney-client dispute. When a defendant requests substitute counsel, the defendant's claims bring the very nature of the attorney-client relationship to the center of the court's attention. A trial court must be able to assess whether a defendant's trial rights have been adequately protected when faced with a motion for new counsel. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052. To that end, a request for new counsel necessarily implies a limited waiver of the attorney-client privilege; the trial court must be able to inquire into the details of a dispute between a defendant and his attorneys — outside the presence of opposing counsel — in order to evaluate the dispute's constitutional character and determine whether the defendant is entitled to replacement counsel. See Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94; see also People v. Trujillo, 144 P.3d 539, 543 (Colo.2006) (discussing implied waiver of attorney-client privilege); C.R.C.P. 1.6(b)(7) (allowing attorneys to reveal confidences to a court in order to \"comply with other law or a court order\"). Concomitant with this, defense attorneys have a duty to respond to a court's specific inquiries regarding the dispute, to speak to their client's allegations, and to explain their reasoning surrounding pertinent trial decisions.\n",
      " Here, his attorneys' silence obstructs an evaluation of whether Bergerud meaningfully retained his constitutional right to testify while represented by counsel. Although Bergerud's lawyers were free to advise him against testifying, they could not, absent some ethical concern, threaten to withdraw as his attorneys or to completely contradict or wholly undermine his testimony were he to exercise that constitutional right.13 The trial court's advisements that Bergerud could testify to the events as he remembered them would have meant little if Bergerud's attorneys were contradicting them during recesses. No matter how reasonable or astute counsel's trial strategies, they cannot take control of those decisions reserved for the defendant alone. See Curtis, 681 P.2d at 512. Without some assurance from counsel that they would not completely contradict the defendant's testimony if offered, we cannot conclude as the trial court did that the conflict merely concerned issues of trial strategy. Arguello, 772 P.2d at 93 (\"Any doubts regarding the waiver must be resolved in the defendant's favor.\" (citing United States v. Williamson, 806 F.2d 216, 220 (10th Cir.1986))); see also People v. Tackett, 742 P.2d 957, 961 (Colo.App.1987) (stating that counsel may not prevent a defendant from presenting an alibi during his own testimony absent an effective waiver of his right to testify, but noting that where the \"defendant's alibi is to be established by testimony of witnesses other than defendant, the decision whether to present such defense is a strategic and tactical decision within the exclusive province of defense counsel.\" (citations omitted)). We cannot, on the record before us, determine whether Bergerud truly \"retain[ed] all of his trial rights.\" Arko, 183 P.3d at 558. Indeed, the record \"strongly suggests\" that Bergerud's attorneys would have wholly undermined his testimony if offered. Wood v. Georgia, 450 U.S. 261, 273, 101 S.Ct. 1097, 67 L.Ed.2d 220 (1981). To this end, it remains unclear, despite the trial court's valiant efforts, whether Bergerud's waiver of his right to counsel was knowing and voluntary.\n",
      "D. Complete Breakdown in Communications\n",
      " Finally, Bergerud's complaint to the trial court about his attorney's conduct amounts to an allegation that communication with his court-appointed counsel had completely\n",
      "broken down.14 \"A defendant who cannot communicate with his attorney cannot assist his attorney with preparation of his case.\" Lott, 310 F.3d at 1250. Therefore, \"[a] trial court's failure to appoint new counsel when faced with a total breakdown in communications may ... constitute a denial of counsel.\" Id.\n",
      " Upon hearing of Bergerud's dissatisfaction with his court-appointed attorneys, the trial court engaged in the requisite inquiry into the nature of Bergerud's complaint. See Garcia, 64 P.3d at 863. The court specifically asked Bergerud to explain the alleged conflict, to outline his proposed self-defense theory, and to pinpoint just what evidence he would present in pursuit of this defense that his attorneys did not agree with.\n",
      " Bergerud's conflict with his attorneys was apparently two-fold. His central concern appeared to be the impact the opening statement would have on the jury. He told the court:\n",
      "I feel that opening statement has to be changed in a self-defense case.... I think on a self-defense case, you have to make the jurors aware of certain things that they're going to hear in testimony from the witnesses that are going to proceed in the trial.\n",
      " At this point, the trial court explained to Bergerud that opening statements were not evidence, but rather statements \"of what is expected to be presented, and if somebody else is presented[,] that doesn't mean that the jury doesn't get to consider that other evidence.\" Nonetheless, Bergerud insisted that there had to be a new opening statement so that later witness testimony would \"ring a bell\" with the jury, reminding them of the presentation of the case in opening statements.\n",
      " His only other detail of disagreement concerned a witness that had not been subpoenaed by his attorneys. Bergerud stated that this witness would testify that \"he had been robbed by [the male victim] and that he had sold a large quantity of methamphetamines to [the male victim].\"\n",
      " Following this discussion, the trial court concluded that the disagreement between Bergerud and his attorneys was not the complete breakdown in communications that Bergerud alleged, but rather a divergence on matters of trial strategy. Evidently, in the trial court's measured view, the decision not to subpoena the additional witness and the framing of the case in opening statements were both reasonable decisions that did not constitute grounds for substitution of counsel or indicate that the attorneys would not present an adequate defense.\n",
      " On these points, the trial court's conclusions are unassailable. What \"bells\" the evidence will ring with the jury vis-à-vis the opening statements is clearly a decision left in the hands of defense counsel. Determining whether to subpoena certain potential witnesses is also a power allocated to defense attorneys. See Schultheis, 638 P.2d at 12; see also Greiner v. Wells, 417 F.3d 305, 323 (2d Cir.2005) (\"The decision not to call a particular witness is typically a question of trial strategy that reviewing courts are ill-suited to second-guess.\" (internal quotations omitted)); United States v. Feyrer, 333 F.3d 110, 119 (2d Cir.2003) (discussing an attorney's decision not to subpoena a \"peripheral\" witness as a matter of trial strategy); United States v. Moore, 104 F.3d 377, 391 (D.C.Cir. 1997) (no ineffective assistance in failing to subpoena a witness whose testimony was \"tangential at best\").\n",
      " However, there is a troubling indication in the record that Bergerud's attorneys failed to adequately investigate his desired theory of self-defense.15 Bergerud's attorneys neither\n",
      "refute nor recast his account of their discussions, in which Bergerud alleged they baldly refused to develop the theory of self-defense and ignored his account of the night's events. Because of defense counsel's reticence to discuss the underlying dispute, there is some concern that Bergerud's attorneys failed in their duty \"to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052; see also People v. Herrera, 188 Colo. 403, 405-06, 534 P.2d 1199, 1200-01 (1975) (describing a lawyer's duty to investigate possible defenses or make reasonable determinations not to pursue them).\n",
      " It may well be that Bergerud's attorneys did investigate the self-defense theory he urged them to and decided reasonably, based on the evidence at hand, that the theory was not viable for presentation. It may also be that Bergerud's counsel, acting on his information, reasonably determined that they should not investigate or pursue the theory further.16 Cf. Herrera, 188 Colo. at 405-06, 534 P.2d at 1200-01; see also Ardolino, 69 P.3d at 76 (\"Strategic choices made after thorough investigation of the law and facts relevant to plausible options are virtually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made after less than complete investigation are reasonable precisely to the extent that reasonable professional judgments support the limitations on investigation.\"). However, the record merely contains evidence that Bergerud's first attorney thought self-defense a viable theory and that Bergerud's own recollection supported the theory. The record's silence concerning counsel's investigations and determinations prohibits us from concluding whether the alleged breakdown in communications did indeed prevent Bergerud's attorneys from putting on an adequate defense. Without further factual development, we cannot conclude whether the alleged breakdown in communications was attributable to Bergerud himself, nor place our imprimatur on the trial court's conclusion that Bergerud's conflict with counsel was likely to recur were he appointed new attorneys.\n",
      "V. Remand\n",
      " As we have noted in the context of ineffective assistance claims, a well-developed record regarding attorney decisions and the nature of the disagreement between counsel and her client is critical to the evaluation of alleged Sixth Amendment violations. See, e.g., Ardolino, 69 P.3d at 77; People v. Thomas, 867 P.2d 880, 886 (Colo.1994). A proper inquiry by a trial court will not only clarify the nature of the dispute and develop a record to facilitate appellate review, but will provide a framework within which the dispute may be resolved.\n",
      " At the outset, the inquiries into the nature of the dispute should take place without the presence of the prosecution, as the trial court properly did here. Of course, the prosecuting attorneys may need to be informed about a proposed resolution of the dispute to the extent that it impacts their preparedness or the ability to proceed to trial. However, sharing anything more than necessary to resolve these matters with the prosecuting attorneys could seriously prejudice the accused's defense. These concerns were artfully managed by the trial court in this case.\n",
      " Next, where the defendant's concerns implicate his constitutional rights or his authority over related fundamental\n",
      "choices, a trial court must inquire into the details of the dispute in order to evaluate the attorneys' decisions. It must then assess whether any improper actions have already resulted in a constitutional violation, or whether the attorneys' assurances that their client's rights will be protected going forward is enough to ensure the reliability of the proceedings and the justice of their result. Where, on the other hand, the trial court determines that the defendant's concerns do not relate to his ability to make those fundamental decisions nor otherwise indicate his attorneys will be unable to present an adequate defense, the defendant will have failed to establish the requisite good cause for granting a motion for new counsel. See Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94.\n",
      " Finally, if the trial court's inquiry was inadequate or the record cannot support final assessment of the alleged violation, the proper remedy, rather than automatic reversal, is to remand the matter for further factual development. See, e.g., Wood, 450 U.S. at 273, 101 S.Ct. 1097 (remanding for the trial court \"to determine whether the conflict of interest that [the] record strongly suggests actually existed\"); Lott, 310 F.3d at 1249-50 (inadequate record concerning motion for new counsel remedied by remand to trial court for investigation as to the underlying facts of the disagreement); Kelling, 151 P.3d at 655 (same).\n",
      " Here, guided by the four factors of our review, we conclude under the second factor that the trial record is insufficient to support the trial court's denial of Bergerud's request for new counsel or our assessment of the motion under the remaining three factors; namely, why Bergerud's motion for new counsel was so late in coming, whether his counsel's conduct did indeed prevent the development of an adequate defense, and to what extent Bergerud may have significantly contributed the conflict with his lawyers. Although the record is sufficient for us to conclude that Bergerud's right to enter a plea had not been impermissibly appropriated by his court-appointed counsel, we cannot tell whether Bergerud meaningfully retained his right to testify while represented by counsel or whether his attorneys had failed in their duty to reasonably investigate possible defenses. Thus, we reverse the court of appeals opinion and order that the case be remanded with directions for inquiries to address the inadequacies of the record.\n",
      " To address the questions left unanswered by the record, the trial court should first determine what caused the delay of Bergerud's request for new counsel, as per the first factor of the four-factor test. If Bergerud should have known the dispute remained unresolved and failed to bring the conflict to the attention of the court earlier despite opportunity to do so, then he was not entitled to substitute counsel and no further inquiry will be required. However, in the event the trial court concludes that Bergerud's lawyers stifled his attempts to bring the matter to the court's attention, or that Bergerud reasonably believed — based on communications with his lawyers — that the conflict had been resolved, then the court must further consider the extent to which his lawyers' actions abrogated Bergerud's other trial rights.\n",
      " In order to evaluate under the third factor of the test whether a constitutional violation prohibited the development of an adequate defense sensitive to Bergerud's fundamental choices, the trial court must determine whether Bergerud's attorneys contradicted or contravened the court's advisements concerning Bergerud's right to testify. If, as the record suggests, Bergerud's counsel indicated in their discussions with him that they would completely contradict his testimony were he to offer it, or that they would otherwise persist in wholly undermining the believability of his testimony through their presentation of evidence, then his lawyers impermissibly usurped his fundamental choice to testify.\n",
      " The trial court should also inquire as to the clarity and persistence with which Bergerud voiced his disagreement to his counsel in order to determine whether Bergerud substantially and unreasonably contributed to the disagreement with his attorneys, pursuant to the fourth factor of the analysis. If he waffled in his desire to testify, intermittently conceded that self-defense was not the best\n",
      "strategy, or gave his attorneys the impression that he supported the course of action they later took in the opening statement, Bergerud's attorneys' strategic decisions not to further investigate the self-defense theory and to pursue the \"toxicology and mental impairment\" defense appear patently reasonable. Furthermore, any inadvertent constraint on his right to testify would have been the natural result of their client's own representations. If, however, Bergerud was as unwavering in his demands as he contends, or if his attorneys understood the nature and degree of their disagreement with their client but nonetheless refused to investigate the self-defense theory or insisted on effectively nullifying Bergerud's wish to testify, then their actions impermissibly constrained Bergerud's trial rights and Bergerud was entitled to replacement counsel.\n",
      " Of course, these inquiries must be sensitive to the fact that there are limitations imposed upon counsel's actions in order to ensure the honesty and integrity of the trial mechanism. Where it appears ethical concerns may have limited the attorneys' choices, that information will be folded into the assessment of the alleged Sixth Amendment violations, supporting the trial court's finding that the conflict is likely to recur with other counsel and excusing strong advisements given to Bergerud regarding his right to testify that did not squarely contradict those given by the trial court.\n",
      " Finally, unlike some Sixth Amendment violations, the complete denial of counsel will not be examined for prejudice or harmlessness. The complete absence of counsel is a structural error demanding reversal for a new trial. See Fulminante, 499 U.S. at 309-10, 111 S.Ct. 1246. Without more, the record will not support the trial court's conclusions that Bergerud's dispute with counsel concerned only matters of trial strategy or that it was likely to recur were Bergerud to have been awarded new counsel. Thus, if the trial court does not find either that Bergerud failed to make reasonable efforts to bring the conflict with his attorneys to the attention of the court at the earliest practicable time, or that Bergerud both meaningfully retained his right to testify and that his attorneys made reasonable investigations (or reasonable determinations not to investigate) regarding Bergerud's self-defense theory, then the court must order a new trial.\n",
      "VI. Conclusion\n",
      " For the foregoing reasons, the opinion of the court of appeals is reversed with directions to remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n",
      " Justice COATS dissents, and Justice RICE and Justice EID join in the dissent.\n",
      "* Justice Rice, Justice Coats and Justice Eid would grant the petition.\n",
      "1. We granted certiorari on two issues:\n",
      " 1. Whether criminal defendants have a fundamental constitutional right to direct their counsel to present an \"innocence-based defense,\" irrespective of counsel's professional judgment.\n",
      " 2. If there is such a constitutional right, what procedures should this Court devise to ensure that defendants are aware of said right, any waiver of it is done in a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent manner, and that counsel is acting pursuant to the defendant's directions and not on the basis of his own professional judgment.\n",
      "2. No error is alleged nor could be found regarding the advisement the trial court gave to Bergerud pursuant to Arguello, 772 P.2d 87.\n",
      "3. These factors were developed to assess a trial court's decision for abuse of discretion. Although we review this case de novo because Bergerud's choice to proceed pro se allowed him to challenge the validity of his waiver of his right to counsel, these factors nonetheless guide our review.\n",
      "4. In such instances, the trial court's decision will generally be reviewed for abuse of discretion. See People ex rel. M.M., 726 P.2d at 1121. In People ex rel. M.M., we stated that the denial of a defendant's motion to discharge his attorney is reviewed for abuse of discretion. See id. (citing Schultheis, 638 P.2d 8). The court of appeals has generally, and properly, interpreted this to mean that the denial of a defendant's request for new counsel should be reviewed for abuse of discretion. See People v. Hodges, 134 P.3d 419, 425 (Colo.App.2005), aff'd on other grounds, 158 P.3d 922 (Colo.2007); People v. Garcia, 64 P.3d 857, 863 (Colo.App.2002); People v. Apodaca, 998 P.2d 25, 28 (Colo.App.1999); but see People v. Abdu, 215 P.3d 1265 (Colo.App.2009), cert. denied No. 09SC498, 2009 WL 2916988 (Colo. Sept. 14, 2009).\n",
      "5. In addition to being legally inapposite, any attempt to measure the prejudicial nature of the attorney's actions in such circumstances would be ill-conceived where, as here, the attorney left the case having had little substantive contact with the jury and no control over the presentation of evidence or arguments ultimately committed to the jury for consideration.\n",
      "6. Our precedent requiring that pro se defendants be held to applicable rules of procedure and evidence is neither implicated here, nor influenced by this discussion. See, e.g., Manka v. Martin, 200 Colo. 260, 267, 614 P.2d 875, 880 (1980); Viles v. Scofield, 128 Colo. 185, 187, 261 P.2d 148, 149 (1953).\n",
      "7. Although the record of such a dispute should generally be made \"in a manner which protects the confidentiality of the lawyer-client relationship,\" ABA Standards for Criminal Justice: Prosecution Function and Defense Function § 4-5.2(c), a defendant may be found to have impliedly waived the lawyer-client privilege — though only to the extent necessary to facilitate the trial court's required inquiry — insofar as his dispute with counsel constitutes \"a claim or defense that focuses on advice given by the attorney.\" People v. Trujillo, 144 P.3d 539, 543 (Colo.2006) (citing Morse v. People, 180 Colo. 49, 501 P.2d 1328 (1972)).\n",
      "8. For example, the defendant noted that his attorney during his first trial had employed a \"toxicology and mental impairment\" defense, and then commented that \"when the [first] trial was over, [my attorney then] came and talked to me and he says `we just went down the wrong avenue. We probably needed to go with self-defense.' ... Which I didn't understand that the two were separate. I thought basically that's what we were actually doing.\"\n",
      "9. Because the trial court granted Bergerud's subsequent request to proceed pro se, we need not here decide whether the court could have denied that request and required him to continue with his attorneys. See, e.g., Williams v. Bartlett, 44 F.3d 95, 99, 100 n. 1 (2d Cir.1994) (discussing a defendant's constitutional right to represent himself, stating that \"[a] criminal defendant must make a timely and unequivocal request to proceed pro se in order to ensure the orderly administration of justice and prevent the disruption of both the pre-trial proceedings and a criminal trial,\" and describing the factors a trial court should consider in exercising its discretion to grant an untimely request (emphasis added)); see also Buhl v. Cooksey, 233 F.3d 783, 795 (3d Cir.2000) (citing numerous federal courts of appeals cases for the proposition that a defendant's request to proceed pro se must be made before the jury has been impaneled or meaningful trial proceedings have begun); People v. King, 121 P.3d 234, 237 (Colo.App.2005) (defendant must timely assert his constitutional right to self-representation). Of course, had Bergerud been required to proceed with existing counsel rather than given the choice to proceed pro se, cf. Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94 (allowing such a choice), the alleged constitutional deficiencies of his attorneys' representation would have been properly reviewed under a claim of their ineffective assistance.\n",
      "10. In its opinion, the court of appeals reasoned that defendants enjoy a fundamental right to choose whether or not to pursue an \"innocence-based\" defense. Precisely what constitutes an \"innocence-based\" defense — and whether self-defense should be considered such a defense theory — is somewhat confused by the parties' briefs. The category would appear to evade consistent application across all contexts, because, in many cases, which defense theories aim for the defendant's complete acquittal depends as much on the charged crime and whether instructions on lesser included offenses are sought as it does on the defense theory itself. In any event, we conclude that the fundamental choices committed to the defendant's decision — including the rights to enter a plea and to testify — provide for adequate protection of a defendant's constitutional rights at trial. We therefore decline to append a new choice to the list of those already entrusted to the defendant alone.\n",
      "11. The People's reliance on Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S. 175, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004), to assert the contrary is misplaced. There, the Supreme Court considered whether defense counsel's concession of guilt without the defendant's express consent constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Court's holding was very narrow:\n",
      "[I]n a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed. When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant's best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel's strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant's explicit consent.\n",
      " Id. at 192. As illustrated by the holding, both the fact that capital cases present defense attorneys with different strategic decisions than do other cases and the defendant's silence were critical to the Court's conclusion. See id. at 191-92. Neither consideration applies here where the death penalty has been abandoned by the prosecution and the defendant explicitly objected to counsel's actions on his behalf.\n",
      "12. Bergerud uses \"judicial admission\" and \"guilty plea\" interchangeably when arguing that his lawyer's opening statement acted as an inappropriate concession of guilt. For the purposes of this discussion only, we agree that it is a distinction without a difference. Compare Boykin, 395 U.S. at 242-43, 242 n. 4, 89 S.Ct. 1709 (describing a guilty plea as \"more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts;\" it is a \"stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced\" (internal quotation marks omitted)) with Bertagnolli, 861 P.2d at 720 (describing judicial admissions) and Benson, 925 P.2d at 781 (same).\n",
      "13. Of course, Bergerud had no right to offer perjured testimony, nor to have it accommodated by the representations of his lawyers. See, e.g., § 18-8-502, C.R.S. (2009) (perjury in the first degree). However, what little record there is on this issue seems to suggest that his attorneys perceived no ethical problem underlying their disagreement with their client. Bergerud's lawyers clarified to the trial court that they did not intend to withdraw from the case, and further noted that they were \"not prepared\" to describe the relationship as \"broken down to the point where [they could not] be effective as counsel for Mr. Bergerud.\" Although not dispositive of the matter, it is the only mention in the record of the attorneys' perception of the disagreement.\n",
      "14. When describing the situation to the trial court, Bergerud repeatedly stated that he had a \"conflict of interest\" with his attorneys. However, although the gravamen of his complaint is that he was unable to effectively communicate with his attorneys or convince them to pursue his desired strategies — and not that his attorneys labored under a conflict of interest because of their obligations to other clients — we here discuss the disagreement by its proper name.\n",
      "15. To our knowledge, allegations that an attorney failed in her duty to investigate pertinent matters to the defense have only before been considered as a claim to the attorney's ineffective assistance, raised once the defendant has been convicted after being represented at trial. We note that such allegations may not be ripe for review in every case when brought to the court's attention prior to the trial's conclusion. However, where, as here, the allegation comes once trial has begun, and indeed after defense counsel allowed the statutory notice deadline for intended self-defense presentations to pass, C.R.C.P. 16(II)(C), Bergerud's complaint that his attorneys failed to adequately investigate the theory is properly reviewable. Assuming their actions failed their duty, that failure was at hand, not merely anticipated.\n",
      "16. We will not, as the People appear to request, examine the evidence made available in Bergerud's later pro se trial to determine whether counsel's apparent determination not to investigate the self-defense theory would have been invariably reasonable. To do so would be to use Bergerud's own inartful efforts at trial to illustrate that any lawyer would be reasonable to refuse to put on such a defense, even though Bergerud had continually asserted that he needed assistance to effectively argue his case to a jury.\n",
      " Justice COATS, dissenting.\n",
      " While I readily acknowledge the difficulty of ensuring criminal defendants, at one and the same time, both a meaningful right to the effective assistance of counsel and a right to personally exercise certain fundamental prerogatives free of counsel's approval or consent, I believe the majority misapprehends the nature and limits of these particular rights and therefore the relationship between them. Perhaps even more importantly, I fear that the complexity and sweeping scope of the majority's opinion is likely to force upon defense counsel and trial courts alike intolerable choices, necessarily based on imprecise predictions about the unfolding of events at trial. I therefore briefly outline my concerns, in the hope that until it is reversed, overruled, or at least limited, the majority opinion will be applied with caution and extended beyond the circumstances of this case no more than absolutely required by its own terms.\n",
      " Ostensibly, the majority rejects outright the notion of a fundamental right to an innocence-based defense, as found by the court of appeals, maj. op. at 699 n. 10, but in the very act of doing so it carves out an even broader right of criminal defendants to control the conduct of their counsel and defense. By construing the fundamental (and personal) right to testify on a defendant's own behalf to include not only taking the stand and giving his account of relevant matters but also the assurance that his testimony will not be undermined by his own counsel, the majority effectively creates a new measure of counsel's effectiveness — one that is not limited by\n",
      "considerations of materiality or prejudice. After today, a criminal defendant apparently need only make known to his appointed counsel the content of his intended testimony and make a timely request for substitution upon learning that counsel intends (or has already done something) to undermine his plan, in order to entitle himself to the appointment of substitute counsel and a mistrial if jeopardy has already attached, or to automatic reversal if he is not satisfied with the outcome of proceeding pro se in the face of a denial of his motion.\n",
      " Since it is easy to lose sight of the question upon which relief in this case actually turns, it may be worth emphasizing that in the majority's analysis reversal ultimately depends upon whether the defendant was improperly denied substitute counsel. The majority reasons that if the defendant was entitled to, but was denied, a mistrial and substitution of appointed counsel, then his choice to proceed pro se was necessarily involuntary, amounting to a complete denial of counsel, a structural error requiring automatic reversal without regard to any showing of prejudice. In my view the majority errs, however, in holding that if appointed counsel indicated to the defendant their intent to undermine his prospective testimony, his trial rights were \"impermissibly usurped,\" entitling him to replacement counsel.\n",
      " Unlike the majority, I do not consider it within the power of counsel, through their conduct of a criminal trial, to deny or deprive a defendant of fundamental trial rights. Regardless of any conduct or concession of his counsel at trial, a defendant can be deprived of a trial right only by the court's failure to ensure that he is adequately informed of it or by denying him a voluntary choice to exercise it. While the denial of certain trial rights may, under some extreme circumstances, be tantamount to the entry of a guilty plea, the conduct of counsel alone cannot deny his client such rights. Cf. Brookhart v. Janis, 384 U.S. 1, 86 S.Ct. 1245, 16 L.Ed.2d 314 (1966) (court wrongfully denied defendant the right of cross-examination and confrontation where agreement to truncate trial procedures was entered without defendant's consent).\n",
      " Similarly, as long as the defendant is made to understand the nature and consequences of his right to testify, including its personal nature, see People v. Curtis, 681 P.2d 504, 514 (Colo.1984), and he is permitted to take the stand and testify freely upon choosing to do so, he has not been deprived of this fundamental right, regardless of the subsequent arguments of counsel. The performance of counsel relative to his client's testimony may well fall below the standard of reasonably competent representation and may in fact prejudice his client's interests, but I believe counsel's choice of tactics at trial implicates the effectiveness of his assistance — not his client's right to testify. Should counsel make unreasonable tactical decisions having an adverse impact on the outcome, a remedy for that conduct is separately available. See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).\n",
      " Furthermore, even though trial courts necessarily retain discretion to order the substitution of appointed counsel in order to avoid the likelihood of future mistrials or reversals (regardless of the defendant's wishes), see Wheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 163, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988) (\"[T]he district court must be allowed substantial latitude in refusing waivers of conflicts of interest not only in those rare cases where an actual conflict may be demonstrated before trial, but in the more common cases where a potential for conflict exists which may or may not burgeon into an actual conflict as the trial progresses.\"); People v. Frisco, 119 P.3d 1093, 1095 (Colo.2005) (same), a criminal defendant is entitled to the replacement of appointed counsel only when it can be determined that his current counsel will be unable, under the circumstances, to provide effective assistance, see 3 Wayne R. LaFave et al., Criminal Procedure § 11.4(b), at 704 (3d ed. 2007) (\"Defendant must have some well founded reason for believing that the appointed attorney cannot or will not competently represent him.\"); People v. Arguello, 772 P.2d 87, 94 (Colo.1989). While various courts (including this one) have discussed\n",
      "a trial court's discretion to replace appointed counsel in terms of a complete breakdown in communications, see, e.g., Arguello, 772 P.2d at 94, the United States Supreme Court has made abundantly clear that indigent defendants are entitled only to effective assistance, without choice concerning any particular counsel, see United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.S. 140, 151, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), and that an \"inferential approach\" to determining whether an indigent defendant's right to effective assistance has been violated is limited to circumstances that \"are so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\" United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. 648, 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039, 80 L.Ed.2d 657 (1984). Short of demonstrating a complete failure to subject the prosecution's case to meaningful adversarial testing or an actual conflict of interest, which necessarily evidences counsel's divided loyalties, a defendant who has appointed counsel at all critical stages can claim ineffective assistance only by pointing to specific errors in the proceedings and demonstrating their materiality with regard to the outcome. Id. at 659 n. 26, 104 S.Ct. 2039. Accordingly, the Supreme Court has only recognized an entitlement to substitute counsel when counsel is actively representing conflicting interests and objects to continued representation. See Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 484, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978). I believe the majority errs by creating a new entitlement to replacement counsel, even after jeopardy has attached, that is completely unrelated to the standard for effective assistance.\n",
      " Beyond what I consider to be an error in the analysis, however, I am concerned that the majority's rationale dangerously places in the hands of criminal defendants a powerful tool to replace appointed counsel virtually at will; to control or delay proceedings to their advantage; and generally to whipsaw courts attempting to balance competing interests while effectively managing crowded dockets. Once they have been cut loose from any mooring in constitutional materiality, it is difficult to fathom the precise contours of terms like \"completely contradict\" or \"wholly undermine\" or how a trial court could possibly be expected to decide when trial tactics or the intentions of defendants and their counsel have become so solidified as no longer to be subject to modification. And even if these ill-defined concepts could provide a sufficiently determinable standard for reliable decision-making, the majority's requirement for courts to intercede in the attorney-client relationship sufficiently to appreciate subtle differences between the vacillating intentions of defendants and their counsel, would, in and of itself, be intolerable.\n",
      " Aside from permitting the trial court to determine whether the defendant's failure to sooner request a substitution of counsel was his own fault, the majority's remand appears to entitle the defendant to a retrial without any likelihood of substandard attorney performance and adverse impact. There was clearly method in the Supreme Court's decision not to simply limit the remedy for a violation of effective assistance but to define the constitutional right itself in terms of substandard performance having an adverse impact. See Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.S. 162, 166, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002); Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686-87, 104 S.Ct. 2052; Cronic, 466 U.S. at 658, 104 S.Ct. 2039. In a case such as this, in which the defendant's claim of self-defense would be contradicted by the discovery of only one firearm at the scene and physical evidence establishing beyond all doubt that the defendant shot his former girlfriend at least three times and her boyfriend six times, it would be difficult to contend with a straight face that the defendant would be prejudiced by his counsel's attempt to lay some foundation for an alternate explanation of his proposed testimony or that such conduct would amount to substandard performance.\n",
      " I find nothing in the Federal Constitution, or in the jurisprudence of either the United States Supreme Court or this court, suggesting a right to the appointment of counsel who will \"accommodate,\" or investigate further, such a preposterous claim. To the extent the Supreme Court has entertained the question at all, it appears to have firmly rejected any suggestion that tactical concessions of guilt to a trier of fact are reserved for the defendant himself. See Florida v. Nixon, 543 U.S.\n",
      "175, 189, 125 S.Ct. 551, 160 L.Ed.2d 565 (2004) (attorney was not \"required to gain express consent before conceding [the defendant's] guilt\").\n",
      " I would therefore simply reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand to that court for consideration of any remaining assignments of error.\n",
      " I am authorized to state that Justice RICE and Justice EID join in this dissent.\n",

      "In preparing for his Iowa state-court trial on a murder charge, respondent consistently told his attorney that although he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand when he stabbed the victim, he was convinced that the victim had a gun. Respondent's companions who were present during the stabbing told counsel that they had not seen a gun, and no gun was found. Counsel advised respondent that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish a claim of self-defense, and that only a reasonable belief that the victim had a gun nearby was necessary even though no gun was actually present.  However, during preparation for direct examination shortly before trial, respondent for the first time told counsel that he had seen \"something metallic\" in the victim's hand.  When asked about this, respondent said:  \"If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead.\"  On respondent's insisting that he would testify that he saw \"something metallic,\" counsel told him that if he testified falsely, it would be counsel's duty to advise the court that he felt respondent was committing perjury, and that counsel probably would be allowed to impeach that testimony and would seek to withdraw from representation if respondent insisted on committing perjury.  Respondent ultimately testified as originally contemplated, admitting on cross-examination that he had not actually seen a gun in the victim's hand.  After the jury found respondent guilty, respondent moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair trial by counsel's admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or \"something metallic.\"  The court denied the motion after a hearing, and the Iowa Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that counsel's actions were not only permissible, but were required under Iowa law.  Respondent then sought federal habeas corpus relief, alleging that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel by his attorney's refusal to allow him to testify as he proposed.  The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that an intent to commit perjury, communicated to counsel, does not alter a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel, and that counsel's threatened violation of his client's confidences violated the \"effective representation\" standards set forth in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.\n",
      "Held:  The Sixth Amendment right of a criminal defendant to assistance of counsel is not violated when an attorney refuses to cooperate with the defendant in presenting perjured testimony at his trial.  Pp. 164-176.\n",
      "(a) Strickland v. Washington, supra, held that to obtain relief by way of federal habeas corpus on a claim of a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, the movant must establish both serious attorney error and prejudice. The Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney's conduct was \"reasonably effective.\"  A court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of attorney conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct and thereby intrude into a state's proper authority to define and apply the standards of professional conduct applicable to those it admits to practice in its courts.  Pp. 164-166.\n",
      "(b) Counsel's conduct here fell within the wide range of professional responses to threatened client perjury acceptable under the Sixth Amendment.  Counsel's duty of loyalty to, and advocacy of, the defendant's cause is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth.  Although counsel must take all reasonable lawful means to attain his client's objectives, counsel is precluded from taking steps or in any way assisting the client in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law. Moreover, accepted norms require that a lawyer disclose his client's perjury and frauds upon the court.  Iowa's Code also expressly permits withdrawal from representation as an appropriate response of an attorney when the client threatens to commit perjury.  Pp. 166-171.\n",
      "(c) The Court of Appeals' holding is not supported by the record since counsel's action, at most, deprived respondent of his contemplated perjury.  Whatever the scope of a constitutional right to testify, it is elementary that such a right does not extend to testifying falsely, and the right to counsel includes no right to have a lawyer who will cooperate with planned perjury. There was no breach of professional duty in counsel's admonition to respondent that he would disclose respondent's perjury to the court.  Pp. 171-175.\n",
      "(d) As a matter of law, counsel's conduct here cannot establish the prejudice required for relief under the Strickland inquiry.  The \"conflict of interests\" involved was one imposed on the attorney by the client's proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony.  This is not the kind of conflict of interest that would render the representation constitutionally infirm.  Pp. 175-176.\n",

      "Whiteside was convicted of second-degree murder by a jury verdict which was affirmed by the Iowa courts.  The killing took place on February 8, 1977, in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  Whiteside and two others went to one Calvin Love's apartment late that night, seeking marihuana.  Love was in bed when Whiteside and his companions arrived;  an argument between Whiteside and Love over the marihuana ensued.  At one point, Love directed his girlfriend to get his \"piece,\" and at another point got up, then returned to his bed.  According to Whiteside's testimony, Love then started to reach under his pillow and moved toward Whiteside.  Whiteside stabbed Love in the chest, inflicting a fatal wound.\n",

      "Whiteside was charged with murder, and when counsel was appointed he objected to the lawyer initially appointed, claiming that he felt uncomfortable with a lawyer who had formerly been a prosecutor.  Gary L. Robinson was then appointed and immediately began an investigation.  Whiteside gave him a statement that he had stabbed Love as the latter \"was pulling a pistol from underneath the pillow on the bed.\"  Upon questioning by Robinson, however, Whiteside indicated that he had not actually seen a gun, but that he was convinced that Love had a gun.  No pistol was found on the premises;  shortly after the police search following the stabbing, which had revealed no weapon, the victim's family had removed all of the victim's possessions from the apartment. Robinson interviewed Whiteside's companions who were present during the stabbing, and none had seen a gun during the incident. Robinson advised Whiteside that the existence of a gun was not necessary to establish the claim of self-defense, and that only a reasonable belief that the victim had a gun nearby was necessary even though no gun was actually present.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "5\n",
      "Until shortly before trial, Whiteside consistently stated to Robinson that he had not actually seen a gun, but that he was convinced that Love had a gun in his hand.  About a week before trial, during preparation for direct examination, Whiteside for the first time told Robinson and his associate Donna Paulsen that he had seen something \"metallic\" in Love's hand.  When asked about this, Whiteside responded:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6\n",
      "\"[I]n Howard Cook's case there was a gun.  If I don't say I  saw a gun, I'm dead.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Robinson told Whiteside that such testimony would be perjury and repeated that it was not necessary to prove that a gun was available but only that Whiteside reasonably believed that he was in danger.  On Whiteside's insisting that he would testify that he saw \"something metallic\" Robinson told him, according to Robinson's testimony:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "\"[W]e could not allow him to [testify falsely] because that  would be perjury, and as officers of the court we would be  suborning perjury if we allowed him to do it;  . . . I  advised him that if he did do that it would be my duty to  advise the Court of what he was doing and that I felt he was  committing perjury;  also, that I probably would be allowed  to attempt to impeach that particular testimony.\"  App. to  Pet. for Cert.

      "\n",
      "10\n",
      "Whiteside testified in his own defense at trial and stated that he \"knew\" that Love had a gun and that he believed Love was reaching for a gun and he had acted swiftly in self-defense.  On cross-examination, he admitted that he had not actually seen a gun in Love's hand.  Robinson presented evidence that Love had been seen with a sawed-off shotgun on other occasions, that the police search of the apartment may have been careless, and that the victim's family had removed everything from the apartment shortly after the crime.  Robinson presented this evidence to show a basis for Whiteside's asserted fear that Love had a gun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11\n",
      "The jury returned a verdict of second-degree murder, and Whiteside moved for a new trial, claiming that he had been deprived of a fair trial by Robinson's admonitions not to state that he saw a gun or \"something metallic.\"  The trial court held a hearing, heard testimony by Whiteside and Robinson, and denied the motion.  The trial court made specific findings that the facts were as related by Robinson.\n",

      "The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed respondent's conviction. State v. Whiteside, 272 N.W.2d 468 (1978).  That court held that the right to have counsel present all appropriate defenses does not extend to using perjury, and that an attorney's duty to a client does not extend to assisting a client in committing perjury.  Relying on DR 7-102(A)(4) of the Iowa Code of Professional Responsibility for Lawyers, which expressly prohibits an attorney from using perjured testimony, and Iowa Code § 721.2 (now Iowa Code § 720.3 (1985)), which criminalizes subornation of perjury, the Iowa court concluded that not only were Robinson's actions permissible, but were required.  The court commended \"both Mr. Robinson and Ms. Paulsen for the high ethical manner in which this matter was handled.\"\n",

      "Whiteside then petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. In that petition Whiteside alleged that he had been denied effective assistance of counsel and of his right to present a defense by Robinson's refusal to allow him to testify as he had proposed.  The District Court denied the writ.  Accepting the state trial court's factual finding that Whiteside's intended testimony would have been perjurious, it concluded that there could be no grounds for habeas relief since there is no constitutional right to present a perjured defense.\n",

      "The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit reversed and directed that the writ of habeas corpus be granted. Whiteside v. Scurr, 744 F.2d 1323 (1984).  The Court of Appeals accepted the findings of the trial judge, affirmed by the Iowa Supreme Court, that trial counsel believed with good cause that Whiteside would testify falsely and acknowledged that under Harris v. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971), a criminal defendant's privilege to testify in his own behalf does not include a right to commit perjury.  Nevertheless, the court reasoned that an intent to commit perjury, communicated to counsel, does not alter a defendant's right to effective assistance of counsel and that Robinson's admonition to Whiteside that he would inform the court of Whiteside's perjury constituted a threat to violate the attorney's duty to preserve client confidences.3  According to the Court of Appeals, this threatened violation of client confidences breached the standards of effective representation set down in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).  The court also concluded that Strickland § prejudice requirement was satisfied by an implication of prejudice from the conflict between Robinson's duty of loyalty to his client and his ethical duties. A petition for rehearing en banc was denied, with Judges Gibson, Ross, Fagg, and Bowman dissenting.  Whiteside v. Scurr, 750 F.2d 713 (1984).  We granted certiorari, 471 U.S. 1014, 105 S.Ct. 2016, 85 L.Ed.2d 298 (1985), and we reverse.\n",

      "The right of an accused to testify in his defense is of relatively recent origin.  Until the latter part of the preceding century, criminal defendants in this country, as at common law, were considered to be disqualified from giving sworn testimony at their own trial by reason of their interest as a party to the case.  See, e.g., Ferguson v. Georgia, 365 U.S. 570, 81 S.Ct. 756, 5 L.Ed.2d 783 (1961);  R. Morris, Studies in the History of American Law 59-60 (2d ed. 1959).

      "16\n",
      "By the end of the 19th century, however, the disqualification was finally abolished by statute in most states and in the federal courts.  Act of Mar. 16, 1878, ch. 37, 20 Stat. 30-31;  see Thayer, A Chapter of Legal History in Massachusetts, 9 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 12 (1895).  Although this Court has never explicitly held that a criminal defendant has a due process right to testify in his own behalf, cases in several Circuits have so held, and the right has long been assumed.  See, e.g., United States v. Curtis, 742 F.2d 1070, 1076 (CA7 1984);  United States v. Bifield, 702 F.2d 342, 349 (CA2), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 931, 103 S.Ct. 2095, 77 L.Ed.2d 304 (1983).  We have also suggested that such a right exists as a corollary to the Fifth Amendment privilege against compelled testimony, see Harris v. New York, supra, 401 U.S., at 225, 91 S.Ct., at 645.  See also Ferguson, 365 U.S., at 598-601, 81 S.Ct., at 771-773 (concurring opinion of Frankfurter, J.);  id., at 601-603, 81 S.Ct., at 772-773 (concurring opinion of Clark, J.).\n",

      "In Strickland v. Washington, we held that to obtain relief by way of federal habeas corpus on a claim of a deprivation of effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment, the movant must establish both serious attorney error and prejudice. To show such error, it must be established that the assistance rendered by counsel was constitutionally deficient in that \"counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\"  Strickland, 466 U.S., at 687, 104 S.Ct., at 2064.  To show prejudice, it must be established that the claimed lapses in counsel's performance rendered the trial unfair so as to \"undermine confidence in the outcome\" of the trial.

Rather, the Sixth Amendment inquiry is into whether the attorney's conduct was \"reasonably effective.\"  To counteract the natural tendency to fault an unsuccessful defense, a court reviewing a claim of ineffective assistance must \"indulge a strong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\"  Id., at 689, 104 S.Ct., at 2066.  In giving shape to the perimeters of this range of reasonable professional assistance, Strickland mandates that\n",

      "Under the Strickland standard, breach of an ethical standard does not necessarily make out a denial of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of assistance of counsel.  When examining attorney conduct, a court must be careful not to narrow the wide range of conduct acceptable under the Sixth Amendment so restrictively as to constitutionalize particular standards of professional conduct and thereby intrude into the state's proper authority to define and apply the standards of professional conduct applicable to those it admits to practice in its courts.  In some future case challenging attorney conduct in the course of a state-court trial, we may need to define with greater precision the weight to be given to recognized canons of ethics, the standards established by the state in statutes or professional codes, and the Sixth Amendment, in defining the proper scope and limits on that conduct.  Here we need not face that question, since virtually all of the sources speak with one voice.\n",

      "We turn next to the question presented:  the definition of the range of \"reasonable professional\" responses to a criminal defendant client who informs counsel that he will perjure himself on the stand.

Plainly, that duty is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth. Although counsel must take all reasonable lawful means to attain the objectives of the client, counsel is precluded from taking steps or in any way assisting the client in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law.  This principle has consistently been recognized in most unequivocal terms by expositors of the norms of professional conduct since the first Canons of Professional Ethics were adopted by the American Bar Association in 1908.  The 1908 Canon 32 provided:\n",
      "\n",

      "23\n",
      "\"No client, corporate or individual, however powerful,  nor any cause, civil or political, however important, is  entitled to receive nor should any lawyer render any service  or advice involving disloyalty to the law whose ministers we  are, or disrespect of the judicial office, which we are bound  to uphold, or corruption of any person or persons exercising  a public office or private trust, or deception or betrayal of  the public. . . .  He must . . . observe and advise his  client to observe the statute law. . . .\" Of course, this Canon did no more than articulate centuries of accepted standards of conduct.  Similarly, Canon 37, adopted in 1928, explicitly acknowledges as an exception to the attorney's duty of confidentiality a client's announced intention to commit a crime:\n",
      "\n",

When an accused proposes to resort to perjury or to produce false evidence, one consequence is the risk of withdrawal of counsel.\n",

      "On this record, the accused enjoyed continued representation within the bounds of reasonable professional conduct and did in fact exercise his right to testify;  at most he was denied the right to have the assistance of counsel in the presentation of false testimony.  Similarly, we can discern no breach of professional duty in Robinson's admonition to respondent that he would disclose respondent's perjury to the court.  The crime of perjury in this setting is indistinguishable in substance from the crime of threatening or tampering with a witness or a juror.  A defendant who informed his counsel that he was arranging to bribe or threaten witnesses or members of the jury would have no \"right\" to insist on counsel's assistance or silence.  Counsel would not be limited to advising against that conduct.  An attorney's duty of confidentiality, which totally covers the client's admission of guilt, does not extend to a client's announced plans to engage in future criminal conduct.  See Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 15, 53 S.Ct. 465, 469, 77 L.Ed. 993 (1933).  In short, the responsibility of an ethical lawyer, as an officer of the court and a key component of a system of justice, dedicated to a search for truth, is essentially the same whether the client announces an intention to bribe or threaten witnesses or jurors or to commit or procure perjury.  No system of justice worthy of the name can tolerate a lesser standard.\n",

      "The rule adopted by the Court of Appeals, which seemingly would require an attorney to remain silent while his client committed perjury, is wholly incompatible with the established standards of ethical conduct and the laws of Iowa and contrary to professional standards promulgated by that State.  The position advocated by petitioner, on the contrary, is wholly consistent with the Iowa standards of professional conduct and law, with the overwhelming majority of courts,8 and with codes of professional ethics.  Since there has been no breach of any recognized professional duty, it follows that there can be no deprivation of the right to assistance of counsel under the Strickland standard.\n",

      "We hold that, as a matter of law, counsel's conduct complained of here cannot establish the prejudice required for relief under the second strand of the Strickland inquiry. Although a defendant need not establish that the attorney's deficient performance more likely than not altered the outcome in order to establish prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show that \"there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  466 U.S., at 694, 104 S.Ct., at 2068. According to Strickland, \"[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\" Ibid.  The Strickland Court noted that the \"benchmark\" of an ineffective-assistance claim is the fairness of the adversary proceeding, and that in judging prejudice and the likelihood of a different outcome, \"[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.\"  Id., at 695, 104 S.Ct., at 2068.\n",

      "In his attempt to evade the prejudice requirement of Strickland, Whiteside relies on cases involving conflicting loyalties of counsel.  In Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), we held that a defendant could obtain relief without pointing to a specific prejudicial default on the part of his counsel, provided it is established that the attorney was \"actively represent[ing] conflicting interests.\" Id., at 350, 100 S.Ct., at 1719.\n",

      "Here, there was indeed a \"conflict,\" but of a quite different kind;  it was one imposed on the attorney by the client's proposal to commit the crime of fabricating testimony without which, as he put it, \"I'm dead.\"  This is not remotely the kind of conflict of interests dealt with in Cuyler v. Sullivan.  Even in that case we did not suggest that all multiple representations necessarily resulted in an active conflict rendering the representation constitutionally infirm.  If a \"conflict\" between a client's proposal and counsel's ethical obligation gives rise to a presumption that counsel's assistance was prejudicially ineffective, every guilty criminal's conviction would be suspect if the defendant had sought to obtain an acquittal by illegal means.  Can anyone doubt what practices and problems would be spawned by such a rule and what volumes of litigation it would generate?\n",

United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 103, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2397, 49 L.Ed.2d 342 (1976).  See also, e.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 1177, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959);  Pyle v.

United States, 315 U.S. 60, 72-75, 62 S.Ct. 457, 465-467, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942) (defense attorney who simultaneously represented two defendants failed to object to certain potentially inadmissible evidence or to cross-examine a prosecution witness in an apparent attempt to minimize one codefendant's guilt).  Here, Whiteside had no legitimate interest that conflicted with Robinson's obligations not to suborn perjury and to adhere to the Iowa Code of Professional Responsibility.\n",

      "In addition, the lawyer's interest in not presenting perjured testimony was entirely consistent with Whiteside's best interest. If Whiteside had lied on the stand, he would have risked a future perjury prosecution.  Moreover, his testimony would have been contradicted by the testimony of other eyewitnesses and by the fact that no gun was ever found.  In light of that impeachment, the jury might have concluded that Whiteside lied as well about his lack of premeditation and thus might have convicted him of first-degree murder.  And if the judge believed that Whiteside had lied, he could have taken Whiteside's perjury into account in setting the sentence.  United States v. Grayson, 438 U.S. 41, 52-54, 98 S.Ct. 2610, 2616-2618, 57 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978).6  In the face of these dangers, an attorney could reasonably conclude that dissuading his client from committing perjury was in the client's best interest and comported with standards of professional responsibility.7  In short, Whiteside failed to show the kind of conflict that poses a danger to the values of zealous and loyal representation embodied in the Sixth Amendment.  A presumption of prejudice is therefore unwarranted.\n",

      "Whether an attorney's response to what he sees as a client's plan to commit perjury violates a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights may depend on many factors:  how certain the attorney is that the proposed testimony is false, the stage of the proceedings at which the attorney discovers the plan, or the ways in which the attorney may be able to dissuade his client, to name just three.  The complex interaction of factors, which is likely to vary from case to case, makes inappropriate a blanket rule that defense attorneys must reveal, or threaten to reveal, a client's anticipated perjury to the court.  Except in the rarest of cases, attorneys who adopt \"the role of the judge or jury to determine the facts,\" United States ex rel. Wilcox v. Johnson, 555 F.2d 115, 122 (CA3 1977), pose a danger of depriving their clients of the zealous and loyal advocacy required by the Sixth Amendment.8\n",

      "I therefore am troubled by the Court's implicit adoption of a set of standards of professional responsibility for attorneys in state criminal proceedings.  See ante, at 168-171. The States, of course, do have a compelling interest in the integrity of their criminal trials that can justify regulating the length to which an attorney may go in seeking his client's acquittal.  But the American Bar Association's implicit suggestion in its brief amicus curiae that the Court find that the Association's Model Rules of Professional Conduct should govern an attorney's responsibilities is addressed to the wrong audience.  It is for the States to decide how attorneys should conduct themselves in state criminal proceedings, and this Court's responsibility extends only to ensuring that the restrictions a State enacts do not infringe a defendant's federal constitutional rights.  Thus, I would follow the suggestion made in the joint brief amici curiae filed by 37 States at the certiorari stage that we allow the States to maintain their \"differing approaches\" to a complex ethical question.  Brief for State of Indiana et al. as Amici Curiae 5.  The signal merit of asking first whether a defendant has shown any adverse prejudicial effect before inquiring into his attorney's performance is that it avoids unnecessary federal interference in a State's regulation of its bar.  Because I conclude that the respondent in this case failed to show such an effect, I join the Court's judgment that he is not entitled to federal habeas relief.\n",

      "Justice Holmes taught us that a word is but the skin of a living thought.  A \"fact\" may also have a life of its own.  From the perspective of an appellate judge, after a case has been tried and the evidence has been sifted by another judge, a particular fact may be as clear and certain as a piece of crystal or a small diamond.  A trial lawyer, however, must often deal with mixtures of sand and clay.  Even a pebble that seems clear enough at first glance may take on a different hue in a handful of gravel.\n",

      "As we view this case, it appears perfectly clear that respondent intended to commit perjury, that his lawyer knew it, and that the lawyer had a duty—both to the court and to his client, for perjured testimony can ruin an otherwise meritorious case—to take extreme measures to prevent the perjury from occurring.  The lawyer was successful and, from our unanimous and remote perspective, it is now pellucidly clear that the client suffered no \"legally cognizable prejudice.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "105\n",
      "Nevertheless, beneath the surface of this case there are areas of uncertainty that cannot be resolved today.  A lawyer's certainty that a change in his client's recollection is a harbinger of intended perjury—as well as judicial review of such apparent certainty—should be tempered by the realization that, after reflection, the most honest witness may recall (or sincerely believe he recalls) details that he previously overlooked. Similarly, the post-trial review of a lawyer's pretrial threat to expose perjury that had not yet been committed—and, indeed, may have been prevented by the threat—is by no means the same as review of the way in which such a threat may actually have been carried out.  Thus, one can be convinced—as I am—that this lawyer's actions were a proper way to provide his client with effective representation without confronting the much more difficult questions of what a lawyer must, should, or may do after his client has given testimony that the lawyer does not believe. The answer to such questions may well be colored by the particular circumstances attending the actual event and its aftermath.\n",

The Seventh Circuit, for example, has held that an attorney's refusal to call the defendant as a witness did not render the conviction constitutionally infirm where the refusal to call the defendant was based on the attorney's belief that the defendant would commit perjury.  United States v. Curtis, 742 F.2d 1070 (1984).  The Third Circuit found a violation of the Sixth Amendment where the attorney could not state any basis for her belief that defendant's proposed alibi testimony was perjured.  United States ex rel.

The more recent Model Rules of Professional Conduct were adopted by the American Bar Association in 1983.  Since their promulgation by the American Bar Association, the Model Rules have been adopted by 11 States: Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Washington.

      " In the evolution of the contemporary standards promulgated by the American Bar Association, an early draft reflects a compromise suggesting that when the disclosure of intended perjury is made during the course of trial, when withdrawal of counsel would raise difficult questions of a mistrial holding, counsel had the option to let the defendant take the stand but decline to affirmatively assist the presentation of perjury by traditional direct examination.  Instead, counsel would stand mute while the defendant undertook to present the false version in narrative form in his own words unaided by any direct examination.  This conduct was thought to be a signal at least to the presiding judge that the attorney considered the testimony to be false and was seeking to disassociate himself from that course.  Additionally, counsel would not be permitted to discuss the known false testimony in closing arguments.  See ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, Proposed Standard 4-7.7 (2d ed. 1980).  Most courts treating the subject rejected this approach and insisted on a more rigorous standard, see, e.g., United States v. Curtis, 742 F.2d 1070 (CA7 1984);  McKissick v. United States, 379 F.2d 754 (CA5 1967);  Dodd v. Florida Bar, 118 So.2d 17, 19 (Fla.1960).  The Eighth Circuit in this case and the Ninth Circuit have expressed approval of the \"free narrative\" standards. Whiteside v. Scurr, 744 F.2d 1323, 1331 (CA8 1984);  Lowery v.

      "Petitioner Gentile, an attorney, held a press conference the day after his client, Sanders, was indicted on criminal charges under Nevada law.  Six months later, a jury acquitted Sanders. Subsequently, respondent State Bar of Nevada filed a complaint against Gentile, alleging that statements he made during the press conference violated Nevada Supreme Court Rule 177, which prohibits a lawyer from making extrajudicial statements to the press that he knows or reasonably should know will have a \"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing\" an adjudicative proceeding, 177(1), which lists a number of statements that are \"ordinarily . . . likely\" to result in material prejudice, 177(2), and which provides that a lawyer \"may state without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense\" \"[n]otwithstanding subsection 1 and 2(a-f),\" 177(3).  The Disciplinary Board found that Gentile violated the Rule and recommended that he be privately reprimanded.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting his contention that the Rule violated his right to free speech.\n",
      "Held:  The judgment is reversed.\n",
      "106 Nev. 60, 787 P.2d 386 (1990), reversed.\n",
      "Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts III and VI, concluding that, as interpreted by the Nevada Supreme Court, Rule 177 is void for vagueness.  Its safe harbor provision, Rule 177(3), misled Gentile into thinking that he could give his press conference without fear of discipline.  Given the Rule's grammatical structure and the absence of a clarifying interpretation by the state court, the Rule fails to provide fair notice to those to whom it is directed and is so imprecise that discriminatory enforcement is a real possibility.  By necessary operation of the word \"notwithstanding,\" the Rule contemplates that a lawyer describing the \"general\" nature of the defense without \"elaboration\" need fear no discipline even if he knows or reasonably should know that his statement will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.  Both \"general\" and \"elaboration\" are classic terms of degree which, in this context, have no settled usage or tradition of interpretation in law, and thus a lawyer has no principle for determining when his remarks pass from the permissible to the forbidden.  A review of the press conference—where Gentile made only a brief opening statement and declined to answer reporters' questions seeking more detailed comments—supports his claim that he thought his statements were protected.  That he was found in violation of the Rules after studying them and making a conscious effort at compliance shows that Rule 177 creates a trap for the wary as well as the unwary.  Pp. 1048-1051.\n",
      "THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I and II, concluding that the \"substantial likelihood of material prejudice\" test applied by Nevada and most other States satisfies the First Amendment.  Pp. 1065-1076.\n",
      "(a) The speech of lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated under a less demanding standard than the \"clear and present danger\" of actual prejudice or imminent threat standard established for regulation of the press during pending proceedings.  See, e.g., Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683.  A lawyer's right to free speech is extremely circumscribed in the courtroom, see, e.g., Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 8, 72 S.Ct. 451, 454, 96 L.Ed. 717, and, in a pending case, is limited outside the courtroom as well, see, e.g., Sheppard v. Maxwell, 384 U.S. 333, 363, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 1522, 16 L.Ed.2d 600.  Cf. Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 104 S.Ct. 2199, 81 L.Ed.2d 17. Moreover, this Court's decisions dealing with a lawyer's First Amendment right to solicit business and advertise have not suggested that lawyers are protected to the same extent as those engaged in other businesses, but have balanced the State's interest in regulating a specialized profession against a lawyer's First Amendment interest in the kind of speech at issue.

      "(b) The \"substantial likelihood of material prejudice\" standard is a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases and the State's interest in fair trials.  Lawyers in such cases are key participants in the criminal justice system, and the State may demand some adherence to that system's precepts in regulating their speech and conduct.  Their extrajudicial statements pose a threat to a pending proceeding's fairness, since they have special access to information through discovery and client communication, and since their statements are likely to be received as especially authoritative.  The standard is designed to protect the integrity and fairness of a State's judicial system and imposes only narrow and necessary limitations on lawyers' speech.  Those limitations are aimed at comments that are likely to influence a trial's outcome or prejudice the jury venire, even if an untainted panel is ultimately found.  Few interests under the Constitution are more fundamental than the right to a fair trial by impartial jurors, and the State has a substantial interest in preventing officers of the court from imposing costs on the judicial system and litigants arising from measures, such as a change of venue, to ensure a fair trial.  The restraint on speech is narrowly tailored to achieve these objectives, since it applies only to speech that is substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect, is neutral to points of view, and merely postpones the lawyer's comments until after the trial.

We set forth the full text of Rule 177 in Appendix B.  Rule 177(1) prohibits an attorney from making \"an extrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by means of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\" Rule 177(2) lists a number of statements that are \"ordinarily . . . likely\" to result in material prejudice.

The State Bar of Nevada reprimanded petitioner for his assertion, supported by a brief sketch of his client's defense, that the State sought the indictment and conviction of an innocent man as a \"scapegoat,\" and had not \"been honest enough to indict the people who did it;  the police department, crooked cops.\"  See infra, Appendix A.

The drugs and money had been used as part of an undercover operation conducted by Metro's Intelligence Bureau.  Petitioner's client, Grady Sanders, owned Western Vault.

Instead, investigators focused upon Western Vault and its owner.

App. 40-42.  Respondent distorts Rule 177 when it suggests this explanation admits a purpose to prejudice the venire and so proves a violation of the Rule.  Rule 177 only prohibits the dissemination of information that one knows or reasonably should know has a \"substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\"  Petitioner did not indicate he thought he could sway the pool of potential jurors to form an opinion in advance of the trial, nor did he seek to discuss evidence that would be inadmissible at trial.  He sought only to counter publicity already deemed prejudicial.  The Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board so found.  It said petitioner attempted \"(i) to counter public opinion which he perceived as adverse to Mr. Sanders, (ii) . . . to refute certain matters regarding his client which had appeared in the media, (iii) to fight back against the perceived efforts of the prosecution to poison the prospective juror pool, and (iv) to publicly present Sanders' side of the case.\" App. 3-4.\n",

      "\n",
      "33\n",
      "Petitioner gave a second reason for holding the press conference, which demonstrates the additional value of his speech. Petitioner acted in part because the investigation had taken a serious toll on his client.  Sanders was \"not a man in good health,\" having suffered multiple open-heart surgeries prior to these events.  Id., at 41.  And prior to indictment, the mere suspicion of wrongdoing had caused the closure of Western Vault and the loss of Sanders' ground lease on an Atlantic City, New Jersey property.  Ibid.\n",

Just as an attorney may recommend a plea bargain or civil settlement to avoid the adverse consequences of a possible loss after trial, so too an attorney may take reasonable steps to defend a client's reputation and reduce the adverse consequences of indictment, especially in the face of a prosecution deemed unjust or commenced with improper motives.

Yount, 467 U.S. 1025, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984), that the timing of a statement was crucial in the assessment of possible prejudice and the Rule's application, accord, Stroble v.

Petitioner was disciplined for statements to the effect that (1) the evidence demonstrated his client's innocence, (2) the likely thief was a police detective, Steve Scholl, and (3) the other victims were not credible, as most were drug dealers or convicted money launderers, all but one of whom had only accused Sanders in response to police pressure, in the process of \"trying to work themselves out of something.\"  Infra, at Appendix A;  App. 2-3 (Findings and Recommendation of the State Bar of Nevada, Southern Nevada Disciplinary Board).  He also strongly implied that Steve Scholl could be observed in a videotape suffering from symptoms of cocaine use.

App. 128-129. Deputy Police Chief Sullivan stated for the police department, \"We in Metro are very satisfied our officers (Scholl and Sgt. Ed Schaub) had nothing to do with this theft or any other.  They are both above reproach.  Both are veteran police officers who are dedicated to honest law enforcement.\"  Ibid.  In the context of general public awareness, these police and prosecution statements were no more likely to result in prejudice than was petitioner's statement, but given the repetitive publicity from the police investigation, it is difficult to come to any conclusion but that the balance remained in favor of the prosecution.\n",

Rule 177(3)(a) provides that a lawyer \"may state without elaboration . . . the general nature of the . . . defense.\"  Statements under this provision are protected \"[n]otwithstanding subsection 1 and 2(a-f).\"  By necessary operation of the word \"notwithstanding,\" the Rule contemplates that a lawyer describing the \"general nature of the . . . defense\" \"without elaboration\" need fear no discipline, even if he comments on \"[t]he character, credibility, reputation or criminal record of a . . . witness,\" and even if he \"knows or reasonably should know that [the statement] will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\"\n",

The right to explain the \"general\" nature of the defense without \"elaboration\" provides insufficient guidance because \"general\" and \"elaboration\" are both classic terms of degree.

The question is not whether discriminatory enforcement occurred here, and we assume it did not, but whether the Rule is so imprecise that discriminatory enforcement is a real possibility.  The inquiry is of particular relevance when one of the classes most affected by the regulation is the criminal defense bar, which has the professional mission to challenge actions of the State.

The cases cited by our colleagues to support this balancing, Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977), Peel v.

We have before us no complaint from the prosecutors, police or presiding judge that petitioner misused information to which he had special access.  And there is no claim that petitioner revealed client confidences, which may be waived in any event.

In re Sawyer involved general comments about Smith Act prosecutions rather than the particular proceeding in which the attorney was involved, conduct which we held not sanctionable under the applicable ABA Canon of Professional Ethics quite apart from any resort to First Amendment principles.  Nebraska Press Assn. considered a challenge to a court order barring the press from reporting matters most prejudicial to the defendant's Sixth Amendment trial right, not information released by defense counsel.  In Sheppard v. Maxwell, we overturned a conviction after a trial that can only be described as a circus, with the courtroom taken over by the press and jurors turned into media stars.  The prejudice to Dr. Sheppard's fair trial right can be traced in principal part to police and prosecutorial irresponsibility and the trial court's failure to control the proceedings and the courthouse environment.

Empirical research suggests that in the few instances when jurors have been exposed to extensive and prejudicial publicity, they are able to disregard it and base their verdict upon the evidence presented in court.  See generally Simon, Does the Court's Decision in Nebraska Press Association Fit the Research Evidence on the Impact on Jurors of News Coverage?, 29 Stan.L.Rev. 515 (1977);  Drechsel, An Alternative View of Media-Judiciary Relations:  What the Non-Legal Evidence Suggests About the Fair Trial-Free Press Issue, 18 Hofstra L.Rev. 1 (1989).  Voir dire can play an important role in reminding jurors to set aside out-of-court information, and to decide the case upon the evidence presented at trial.  All of these factors weigh in favor of affording an attorney's speech about ongoing proceedings our traditional First Amendment protections.  Our colleagues' historical survey notwithstanding, respondent has not demonstrated any sufficient state interest in restricting the speech of attorneys to justify a lower standard of First Amendment scrutiny.\n",

      "Still less justification exists for a lower standard of scrutiny here, as this speech involved not the prosecutor or police, but a criminal defense attorney.  Respondent and its amici present not a single example where a defense attorney has managed by public statements to prejudice the prosecution of the state's case.  Even discounting the obvious reason for a lack of appellate decisions on the topic—the difficulty of appealing a verdict of acquittal—the absence of anecdotal or survey evidence in a much-studied area of the law is remarkable.\n",

      "The various bar association and advisory commission reports which resulted in promulgation of ABA Model Rule of Professional Conduct 3.6 (1981), and other regulations of attorney speech, and sources they cite, present no convincing case for restrictions upon the speech of defense attorneys.  See Swift, Model Rule 3.6: An Unconstitutional Regulation of Defense Attorney Trial Publicity, 64 Boston U.L.Rev. 1003, 1031-1049 (1984) (summarizing studies and concluding there is no empirical or anecdotal evidence of a need for restrictions on defense publicity);  see also Drechsel, supra, at 35 (\"data showing the heavy reliance of journalists on law enforcement sources and prosecutors confirms the appropriateness of focusing attention on those sources when attempting to control pre-trial publicity\").  The police, the prosecution, other government officials, and the community at large hold innumerable avenues for the dissemination of information adverse to a criminal defendant, many of which are not within the scope of Rule 177 or any other regulation.  By contrast, a defendant cannot speak without fear of incriminating himself and prejudicing his defense, and most criminal defendants have insufficient means to retain a public relations team apart from defense counsel for the sole purpose of countering prosecution statements.  These factors underscore my conclusion that blanket rules restricting speech of defense attorneys should not be accepted without careful First Amendment scrutiny.\n",

      "Respondent uses the \"officer of the court\" label to imply that attorney contact with the press somehow is inimical to the attorney's proper role.  Rule 177 posits no such inconsistency between an attorney's role and discussions with the press.  It permits all comment to the press absent \"a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding.\"  Respondent does not articulate the principle that contact with the press cannot be reconciled with the attorney's role or explain how this might be so.\n",

Bauer, 522 F.2d 242, 250 (CA7 1975).  To the extent the press and public rely upon attorneys for information because attorneys are well-informed, this may prove the value to the public of speech by members of the bar.  If the dangers of their speech arise from its persuasiveness, from their ability to explain judicial proceedings, or from the likelihood the speech will be believed, these are not the sort of dangers that can validate restrictions.  The First Amendment does not permit suppression of speech because of its power to command assent.\n",

      "One may concede the proposition that an attorney's speech about pending cases may present dangers that could not arise from statements by a nonparticipant, and that an attorney's duty to cooperate in the judicial process may prevent him or her from taking actions with an intent to frustrate that process.  The role of attorneys in the criminal justice system subjects them to fiduciary obligations to the court and the parties.  An attorney's position may result in some added ability to obstruct the proceedings through well-timed statements to the press, though one can debate the extent of an attorney's ability to do so without violating other established duties.  A court can require an attorney's cooperation to an extent not possible of nonparticipants.  A proper weighing of dangers might consider the harm that occurs when speech about ongoing proceedings forces the court to take burdensome steps such as sequestration, continuance, or change of venue.\n",

But this case involves the sanction of speech so innocuous, and an application of Rule 177(3)'s safe harbor provision so begrudging, that it is difficult to determine the force these arguments would carry in a different setting.  The instant case is a poor vehicle for defining with precision the outer limits under the Constitution of a court's ability to regulate an attorney's statements about ongoing adjudicative proceedings.  At the very least, however, we can say that the Rule which punished petitioner's statement represents a limitation of First Amendment freedoms greater than is necessary or essential to the protection of the particular governmental interest, and does not protect against a danger of the necessary gravity, imminence, or likelihood.\n",

Though cost and delays undermine it in all too many cases, the American judicial trial remains one of the purest, most rational forums for the lawful determination of disputes.  A profession which takes just pride in these traditions may consider them disserved if lawyers use their skills and insight to make untested allegations in the press instead of in the courtroom.  But constraints of professional responsibility and societal disapproval will act as sufficient safeguards in most cases.  And in some circumstances press comment is necessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse of the courts. It cannot be said that petitioner's conduct demonstrated any real or specific threat to the legal process, and his statements have the full protection of the First Amendment.3\n",

The Advisory Committee developed the ABA Standards Relating to Fair Trial and Free Press, comprehensive guidelines relating to disclosure of information concerning criminal proceedings, which were relied upon by the ABA in 1968 in formulating Rule 3.6.  The need for and appropriateness of such a rule had been identified by this Court two years earlier in Sheppard v. Maxwell, supra, 384 U.S., at 362-363, 86 S.Ct. at 1522-1523.  In 1966, the Judicial Conference of the United States authorized a \"Special Subcommittee to Implement Sheppard v. Maxwell \" to proceed with a study of the necessity of promulgating guidelines or taking other corrective action to shield federal juries from prejudicial publicity.  See Report of the Committee on the Operation of the Jury System on the \"Free Press-Fair Trial\" Issue, 45 F.R.D. 391, 404-407 (1968).  Courts, responding to the recommendations in this report, proceeded to enact local rules incorporating these standards, and thus the \"reasonable likelihood of prejudicing a fair trial\" test was used by a majority of courts, state and federal, in the years following Sheppard.  Ten years later, the ABA amended its guidelines, and the \"reasonable likelihood\" test was changed to a \"clear and present danger\" test.

Currently, 31 States in addition to Nevada have adopted—either verbatim or with insignificant variations—Rule 3.6 of the ABA's Model Rules.1 Eleven States have adopted Disciplinary Rule 7-107 of the ABA's Code of Professional Responsibility, which is less protective of lawyer speech than Model Rule 3.6, in that it applies a \"reasonable likelihood of prejudice\" standard.2  Only one State, Virginia, has explicitly adopted a clear and present danger standard, while four States and the District of Columbia have adopted standards that arguably approximate \"clear and present danger.\"3\n",

Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976), Bridges v. California, 314 U.S. 252, 62 S.Ct. 190, 86 L.Ed. 192 (1941), Pennekamp v.

In those cases we held that trial courts might not constitutionally punish, through use of the contempt power, newspapers and others for publishing editorials, cartoons, and other items critical of judges in particular cases.

      "These opposing positions illustrate one of the many dilemmas which arise in the course of constitutional adjudication.  The above quotes from Patterson and Bridges epitomize the theory upon which our criminal justice system is founded:  the outcome of a criminal trial is to be decided by impartial jurors, who know as little as possible of the case, based on material admitted into evidence before them in a court proceeding.  Extrajudicial comments on, or discussion of, evidence which might never be admitted at trial and ex parte statements by counsel giving their version of the facts obviously threaten to undermine this basic tenet.\n",

      "At the same time, however, the criminal justice system exists in a larger context of a government ultimately of the people, who wish to be informed about happenings in the criminal justice system, and, if sufficiently informed about those happenings might wish to make changes in the system.  The way most of them acquire information is from the media.  The First Amendment protections of speech and press have been held, in the cases cited above, to require a showing of \"clear and present danger\" that a malfunction in the criminal justice system will be caused before a State may prohibit media speech or publication about a particular pending trial.  The question we must answer in this case is whether a lawyer who represents a defendant involved with the criminal justice system may insist on the same standard before he is disciplined for public pronouncements about the case, or whether the State instead may penalize that sort of speech upon a lesser showing.\n",

      "It is unquestionable that in the courtroom itself, during a judicial proceeding, whatever right to \"free speech\" an attorney has is extremely circumscribed.  An attorney may not, by speech or other conduct, resist a ruling of the trial court beyond the point necessary to preserve a claim for appeal.  Sacher v. United States, 343 U.S. 1, 8, 72 S.Ct. 451, 454, 96 L.Ed. 717 (1952) (criminal trial);  Fisher v. Pace, 336 U.S. 155, 69 S.Ct. 425, 93 L.Ed. 569 (1949) (civil trial).  Even outside the courtroom, a majority of the Court in two separate opinions in the case of In re Sawyer, 360 U.S. 622, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473 (1959), observed that lawyers in pending cases were subject to ethical restrictions on speech to which an ordinary citizen would not be. There, the Court had before it an order affirming the suspension of an attorney from practice because of her attack on the fairness and impartiality of a judge.  The plurality opinion, which found the discipline improper, concluded that the comments had not in fact impugned the judge's integrity.  Justice Stewart, who provided the fifth vote for reversal of the sanction, said in his separate opinion that he could not join any possible \"intimation that a lawyer can invoke the constitutional right of free speech to immunize himself from evenhanded discipline for proven unethical conduct.\"  Id., at 646, 79 S.Ct., at 1388.  He said that \"[o]bedience to ethical precepts may require abstention from what in other circumstances might be constitutionally protected speech.\"  Id., at 646-647, 79 S.Ct., at 1388-1389.  The four dissenting Justices who would have sustained the discipline said: \"Of course, a lawyer is a person and he too has a constitutional freedom of utterance and may exercise it to castigate courts and their administration of justice.

In that case we said that \"[a]lthough litigants do not 'surrender their First Amendment rights at the courthouse door,' those rights may be subordinated to other interests that arise in this setting,\" id., at 32-33, n. 18, 104 S.Ct., at 2207-2208, n. 18 (citation omitted), and noted that \"on several occasions [we have] approved restriction on the communications of trial participants where necessary to ensure a fair trial for a criminal defendant.\"  Ibid.\n",

      "Even in an area far from the courtroom and the pendency of a case, our decisions dealing with a lawyer's right under the First Amendment to solicit business and advertise, contrary to promulgated rules of ethics, have not suggested that lawyers are protected by the First Amendment to the same extent as those engaged in other businesses.  See, e.g., Bates v. State Bar of Arizona, 433 U.S. 350, 97 S.Ct. 2691, 53 L.Ed.2d 810 (1977);  Peel v. Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Comm'n of Illinois, 496 U.S. ----, 110 S.Ct. 2281, 110 L.Ed.2d 83 (1990);  Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978).  In each of these cases, we engaged in a balancing process, weighing the State's interest in the regulation of a specialized profession against a lawyer's First Amendment interest in the kind of speech that was at issue.  These cases recognize the long-established principle stated in In re Cohen, 7 N.Y.2d 488, 495, 199 N.Y.S.2d 658, 661, 166 N.E.2d 672, 675 (1960):\n",

      "We think that the quoted statements from our opinions in In re Sawyer, 360 U.S. 622, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473 (1959), and Sheppard v. Maxwell, supra, rather plainly indicate that the speech of lawyers representing clients in pending cases may be regulated under a less demanding standard than that established for regulation of the press in Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart, 427 U.S. 539, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683 (1976), and the cases which preceded it.  Lawyers representing clients in pending cases are key participants in the criminal justice system, and the State may demand some adherence to the precepts of that system in regulating their speech as well as their conduct.  As noted by Justice Brennan in his concurring opinion in Nebraska Press, which was joined by Justices Stewart and Marshall, \"[a]s officers of the court, court personnel and attorneys have a fiduciary responsibility not to engage in public debate that will redound to the detriment of the accused or that will obstruct the fair administration of justice.\"  427 U.S., at 601, n. 27, 96 S.Ct., at 2823, n. 27.  Because lawyers have special access to information through discovery and client communications, their extrajudicial statements pose a threat to the fairness of a pending proceeding since lawyers' statements are likely to be received as especially authoritative.  See, e.g., In re Hinds, 90 N.J. 604, 627, 449 A.2d 483, 496 (1982) (statements by attorneys of record relating to the case \"are likely to be considered knowledgeable, reliable and true\" because of attorneys' unique access to information);  In re Rachmiel, 90 N.J. 646, 656, 449 A.2d 505, 511 (N.J.1982) (attorneys' role as advocates gives them \"extraordinary power to undermine or destroy the efficacy of the criminal justice system\").  We agree with the majority of the States that the \"substantial likelihood of material prejudice\" standard constitutes a constitutionally permissible balance between the First Amendment rights of attorneys in pending cases and the state's interest in fair trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "146\n",
      "When a state regulation implicates First Amendment rights, the Court must balance those interests against the State's legitimate interest in regulating the activity in question.  See, e.g., Seattle Times, supra, 467 U.S. at 32, 104 S.Ct., at 2207. The \"substantial likelihood\" test embodied in Rule 177 is constitutional under this analysis, for it is designed to protect the integrity and fairness of a state's judicial system, and it imposes only narrow and necessary limitations on lawyers' speech. The limitations are aimed at two principal evils:  (1) comments that are likely to influence the actual outcome of the trial, and (2) comments that are likely to prejudice the jury venire, even if an untainted panel can ultimately be found.  Few, if any, interests under the Constitution are more fundamental than the right to a fair trial by \"impartial\" jurors, and an outcome affected by extrajudicial statements would violate that fundamental right.  See, e.g., Sheppard, 384 U.S., at 350-351, 86 S.Ct., at 1515-1516;  Turner v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 466, 473, 85 S.Ct. 546, 550, 13 L.Ed.2d 424 (1965) (evidence in criminal trial must come solely from witness stand in public courtroom with full evidentiary protections).  Even if a fair trial can ultimately be ensured through voir dire, change of venue, or some other device, these measures entail serious costs to the system.  Extensive voir dire may not be able to filter out all of the effects of pretrial publicity, and with increasingly widespread media coverage of criminal trials, a change of venue may not suffice to undo the effects of statements such as those made by petitioner.  The State has a substantial interest in preventing officers of the court, such as lawyers, from imposing such costs on the judicial system and on the litigants.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "147\n",
      "The restraint on speech is narrowly tailored to achieve those objectives.  The regulation of attorneys' speech is limited—it applies only to speech that is substantially likely to have a materially prejudicial effect;  it is neutral as to points of view, applying equally to all attorneys participating in a pending case;  and it merely postpones the attorney's comments until after the trial.  While supported by the substantial state interest in preventing prejudice to an adjudicative proceeding by those who have a duty to protect its integrity, the rule is limited on its face to preventing only speech having a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing that proceeding.\n",

      "To assist a lawyer in deciding whether an extrajudicial statement is problematic, Rule 177 sets out statements that are likely to cause material prejudice.  Contrary to petitioner's contention, these are not improper evidentiary presumptions. Model Rule 3.6, from which Rule 177 was derived, was specifically designed to avoid the categorical prohibitions of attorney speech contained in ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility Disciplinary Rule 7-107 (1981).  See ABA Commission on Evaluation of Professional Standards, Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Notes and Comments 143-144 (Proposed Final Draft, May 30, 1981) (Proposed Final Draft).

See State v. Van Duyne, 43 N.J. 369, 389, 204 A.2d  841, 852 (1964), in which the court interpreted Canon 20 of  the American Bar Association's Canons of Professional Ethics  to prohibit such statements.\"  384 U.S., at 361, 86 S.Ct., at  1521.\n",

      "Gentile claims that Rule 177 is overbroad, and thus unconstitutional on its face, because it applies to more speech than is necessary to serve the State's goals.  The \"overbreadth\" doctrine applies if an enactment \"prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.\"  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 114, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2302, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972).  To be unconstitutional, overbreadth must be \"substantial.\"  Board of Trustees of State University of New York v. Fox, 492 U.S. 469, 485, 109 S.Ct. 3028, 3037, 106 L.Ed.2d 388 (1989).  Rule 177 is no broader than necessary to protect the State's interests.  It applies only to lawyers involved in the pending case at issue, and even those lawyers involved in pending cases can make extrajudicial statements as long as such statements do not present a substantial risk of material prejudice to an adjudicative proceeding.  The fact that Rule 177 applies to bench trials does not make it overbroad, for a substantial likelihood of prejudice is still required before the Rule is violated.  That test will rarely be met where the judge is the trier of fact, since trial judges often have access to inadmissible and highly prejudicial information and are presumed to be able to discount or disregard it.  For these reasons Rule 177 is constitutional on its face.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "152\n",
      "Gentile also argues that Rule 177 is void for vagueness because it did not provide adequate notice that his comments were subject to discipline.  The void-for-vagueness doctrine is concerned with a defendant's right to fair notice and adequate warning that his conduct runs afoul of the law.  See, e.g., Smith v. Goguen, 415 U.S. 566, 572-573, 94 S.Ct. 1242, 1246-1247, 39 L.Ed.2d 605 (1974);  Colten v. Kentucky, 407 U.S. 104, 110, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 1957, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972).  Rule 177 was drafted with the intent to provide \"an illustrative compilation that gives fair notice of conduct ordinarily posing unacceptable dangers to the fair administration of justice.\"  Proposed Final Draft 143. The Rule provides sufficient notice of the nature of the prohibited conduct.  Under the circumstances of his case, petitioner cannot complain about lack of notice, as he has admitted that his primary objective in holding the press conference was the violation of Rule 177's core prohibition—to prejudice the upcoming trial by influencing potential jurors. Petitioner was clearly given notice that such conduct was forbidden, and the list of conduct likely to cause prejudice, while only advisory, certainly gave notice that the statements made would violate the rule if they had the intended effect.\n",

      "The majority agrees with petitioner that he was the victim of unconstitutional vagueness in the regulations because of the relationship between subsection 3 and subsections 1 and 2 of rule 177 (see infra, Pp. 1033-1034).  Subsection 3 allows an attorney to state \"the general nature of the claim or defense\" notwithstanding the prohibition contained in subsection 1 and the examples contained in subsection 2.  It is of course true, as the majority points out, that the word \"general\" and the word \"elaboration\" are both terms of degree.  But combined as they are in the first sentence of subsection 3, they convey the very definite proposition that the authorized statements must not contain the sort of detailed allegations that petitioner made at his press conference.  No sensible person could think that the following were \"general\" statements of a claim or defense made \"without elaboration\":  \"the person that was in the most direct position to have stolen the drugs and the money . . . is Detective Steve Scholl\";  \"there is far more evidence that will establish that Detective Scholl took these drugs and took these American Express travelers' checks than any other living human being\"; \"[Detective Scholl] either had a hell of a cold, or he should have seen a better doctor\";  and \"the so-called other victims . . . one, two four of them are known drug dealers and convicted money launderers.\"  Subsection 3, as an exception to the provisions of subsections 1 and 2, must be read in the light of the prohibitions and examples contained in the first two sections.  It was obviously not intended to negate the prohibitions or the examples wholesale, but simply intended to provide a \"safe harbor\" where there might be doubt as to whether one of the examples covered proposed conduct.  These provisions were not vague as to the conduct for which petitioner was disciplined;  \"[i]n determining the sufficiency of the notice a statute must of necessity be examined in the light of the conduct with which a defendant is charged.\"  United States v. National Dairy Products Corp., 372 U.S. 29, 33, 83 S.Ct. 594, 598, 9 L.Ed.2d 561 (1963).\n",

      "Petitioner's strongest arguments are that the statement was made well in advance of trial, and that the statements did not in fact taint the jury panel.  But the Supreme Court of Nevada pointed out that petitioner's statements were not only highly inflammatory—they portrayed prospective government witnesses as drug users and dealers, and as money launderers—but the statements were timed to have maximum impact, when public interest in the case was at its height immediately after Sanders was indicted. Reviewing independently the entire record, see Pennekamp v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331, 335, 66 S.Ct. 1029, 1031, 90 L.Ed. 1295 (1946), we are convinced that petitioner's statements were \"substantially likely to cause material prejudice\" to the proceedings.  While there is evidence pro and con on that point, we find it persuasive that, by his own admission, petitioner called the press conference for the express purpose of influencing the venire.  It is difficult to believe that he went to such trouble, and took such a risk, if there was no substantial likelihood that he would succeed.\n",

The State Bar of Nevada, which made its own factual findings, and the Supreme Court of Nevada, which upheld those findings, were in a far better position than we are to appreciate the likely effect of petitioner's statements on potential members of a jury panel in a highly publicized case such as this.  The Board and Nevada Supreme Court did not apply the list of statements likely to cause material prejudice as presumptions, but specifically found that petitioner had intended to prejudice the trial,6 and that based upon the nature of the statements and their timing, they were in fact substantially likely to cause material prejudice.  We cannot, upon our review of the record, conclude that they were mistaken.  See United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 394-396, 68 S.Ct. 525, 541-542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948).\n",

      "Several amici argue that the First Amendment requires the state to show actual prejudice to a judicial proceeding before an attorney may be disciplined for extrajudicial statements, and since the Board and Nevada Supreme Court found no actual prejudice, petitioner should not have been disciplined.  But this is simply another way of stating that the stringent standard of Nebraska Press should be applied to the speech of a lawyer in a pending case, and for the reasons heretofore given we decline to adopt it.  An added objection to the stricter standard when applied to lawyer participants is that if it were adopted, even comments more flagrant than those made by petitioner could not serve as the basis for disciplinary action if, for wholly independent reasons, they had no effect on the proceedings.  An attorney who made prejudicial comments would be insulated from discipline if the government, for reasons unrelated to the comments, decided to dismiss the charges, or if a plea bargain were reached.  An equally culpable attorney whose client's case went to trial would be subject to discipline.  The United States Constitution does not mandate such a fortuitous difference.\n",

In particular, I agree that a State may regulate speech by lawyers representing clients in pending cases more readily than it may regulate the press.  Lawyers are officers of the court and, as such, may legitimately be subject to ethical precepts that keep them from engaging in what otherwise might be constitutionally protected speech.  See In re Sawyer, 360 U.S. 622, 646-647, 79 S.Ct. 1376, 1388-1389, 3 L.Ed.2d 1473 (1959) (Stewart, J., concurring in the result).  This does not mean, of course, that lawyers forfeit their First Amendment rights, only that a less demanding standard applies.

      "For the reasons set out in Part III of Justice KENNEDY's opinion, however, I believe that Nevada's rule is void for vagueness.  Subsection (3) of Rule 177 is a \"safe harbor\" provision.  It states that \"notwithstanding\" the prohibitory language located elsewhere in the rule, \"a lawyer involved in the investigation or litigation may state without elaboration . . . [t]he general nature of the claim or defense.\"  Gentile made a conscious effort to stay within the boundaries of this \"safe harbor.\"  In his brief press conference, Gentile gave only a rough sketch of the defense that he intended to present at trial—i.e., that Detective Scholl, not Grady Sanders, stole the cocaine and traveler's checks.  When asked to provide more details, he declined, stating explicitly that the ethical rules compelled him to do so.  Ante, at 1049.  Nevertheless, the disciplinary board sanctioned Gentile because, in its view, his remarks went beyond the scope of what was permitted by the rule.  Both Gentile and the disciplinary board have valid arguments on their side, but this serves to support the view that the rule provides insufficient guidance.  As Justice KENNEDY correctly points out, a vague law offends the Constitution because it fails to give fair notice to those it is intended to deter and creates the possibility of discriminatory enforcement.  See Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip, --- U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1032, 1056, 113 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991) (O'CONNOR, J., dissenting).

      " We disagree with Justice KENNEDY's statement that this case \"does not call into question the constitutionality of other states' prohibitions upon attorney speech that will have a 'substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding,' but is limited to Nevada's interpretation of that standard.\"  Supra, at 1034.  Petitioner challenged Rule 177 as being unconstitutional on its face in addition to as applied, contending that the \"substantial likelihood of material prejudice\" test was unconstitutional, and that lawyer speech should be punished only if it violates the standard for clear and present danger set forth in Nebraska Press.  See Petr.'s Br. 27-31.  The validity of the rules in the many states applying the \"substantial likelihood of material prejudice\" test has, therefore, been called into question in this case.\n",

      " The Nevada Supreme Court has consistently read all parts of Rule 177 as applying only to lawyers in pending cases, and not to other lawyers or nonlawyers.  We express no opinion on the constitutionality of a rule regulating the statements of a lawyer who is not participating in the pending case about which the statements are made.  We note that of all the cases petitioner cites as supporting the use of the clear and present danger standard, the only one that even arguably involved a non-third party was Wood v. Georgia, 370 U.S. 375, 82 S.Ct. 1364, 8 L.Ed.2d 569 (1962), where a county sheriff was held in contempt for publicly criticizing instructions given by a judge to a grand jury.  Although the sheriff was technically an \"officer of the court\" by virtue of his position, the Court determined that his statements were made in his capacity as a private citizen, with no connection to his official duties.  Id., at 393, 82 S.Ct., at 1374.  The same cannot be said about petitioner, whose statements were made in the course of and in furtherance of his role as defense counsel.\n",

      " Justice KENNEDY appears to contend that there can be no material prejudice when the lawyer's publicity is in response to publicity favorable to the other side.  Supra, at ----.  Justice KENNEDY would find that publicity designed to counter prejudicial publicity cannot be itself prejudicial, despite its likelihood of influencing potential jurors, unless it actually would go so far as to cause jurors to be affirmatively biased in favor of the lawyer's client.  In the first place, such a test would be difficult, if not impossible, to apply.  But more fundamentally, it misconceives the constitutional test for an impartial juror whether the \"juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict on the evidence presented in Court.\"  Murphy v. Florida, 421 U.S. 794, 800, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 2036, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975).  A juror who may have been initially swayed from open-mindedness by publicity favorable to the prosecution is not rendered fit for service by being bombarded by publicity favorable to the defendant.  The basic premise of our legal system is that law suits should be tried in court, not in the media.  See, e.g., Bridges, 314 U.S., at 271, 62 S.Ct., at 197;  Patterson, 205 U.S., at 462, 27 S.Ct., at 558.  A defendant may be protected from publicity by, or in favor of, the police and prosecution through voir dire, change of venue, jury instructions and, in extreme cases, reversal on due process grounds.  The remedy for prosecutorial abuses that violate the rule lies not in self-help in the form of similarly prejudicial comments by defense counsel, but in disciplining the prosecutor.\n",

There, as in the four cases before us, law enforcement officials took the defendant into custody and interrogated him in a police station for the purpose of obtaining a confession. The police did not effectively advise him of his right to remain silent or of his right to consult with his attorney. Rather, they confronted him with an alleged accomplice who accused him of having perpetrated a murder. When the defendant denied the accusation and said 'I didn't shoot Manuel, you did it,' they handcuffed him and took him to an interrogation room. There, while handcuffed and standing, he was questioned for four hours until he confessed. During this interrogation, the police denied his request to speak to his attorney, and they prevented his retained attorney, who had come to the police station, from consulting with him. At his trial, the State, over his objection, introduced the confession against him. We held that the statements thus made were constitutionally inadmissible.\n",

That case was but an explication of basic rights that are enshrined in our Constitution—that 'No person * * * shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,' and that 'the accused shall * * * have the Assistance of Counsel' rights which were put in jeopardy in that case through official overbearing. These precious rights were fixed in our Constitution only after centuries of persecution and struggle. And in the words of Chief Justice Marshall, they were secured 'for ages to come, and * * * designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it,' Cohens v.

      "'The maxim 'Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare,' had its origin in  a protest against the inquisitorial and manifestly unjust  methods of interrogating accused persons, which (have) long  obtained in the continental system, and, until the expulsion  of the Stuarts from the British throne in 1688, and the  erection of additional barriers for the protection of the  people against the exercise of arbitrary power, (were) not  uncommon even in England. While the admissions or confessions  of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have  always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence, if  an accused person be asked to explain his apparent connection  with a crime under investigation, the ease with which the questions put to him may assume an inquisitorial character,  the temptation to press the witness unduly, to browbeat him  if he be timid or reluctant, to push him into a corner, and  to entrap him into fatal contradictions, which is so  painfully evident in many of the earlier state trials,  notably in those of Sir Nicholas Throckmorton, and Udal, the  Puritan minister, made the system so odious as to give rise  to a demand for its total abolition. The change in the  English criminal procedure in that particular seems to be  founded upon no statute and no judicial opinion, but upon a  general and silent acquiescence of the courts in a popular  demand. But, however adopted, it has become firmly embedded  in English, as well as in American jurisprudence. So deeply  did the iniquities of the ancient system impress themselves  upon the minds of the American colonists that the States,  with one accord, made a denial of the right to question an  accused person a part of their fundamental law, so that a  maxim, which in England was a mere rule of evidence, became  clothed in this country with the impregnability of a  constitutional enactment.'

      "Our holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow but briefly stated it is this: the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination. By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.4 As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required. Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed. The defendant may waive effectuation of these rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently. If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking there can be no questioning. Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him. The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned.\n",

      "The constitutional issue we decide in each of these cases is the admissibility of statements obtained from a defendant questioned while in custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way. In each, the defendant was questioned by police officers, detectives, or a prosecuting attorney in a room in which he was cut off from the outside world. In none of these cases was the defendant given a full and effective warning of his rights at the outset of the interrogation process. In all the cases, the questioning elicited oral admissions, and in three of them, signed statements as well which were admitted at their trials. They all thus share salient features—incommunicado interrogation of individuals in a police-dominated atmosphere, resulting in self-incriminating statements without full warnings of constitutional rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "12\n",
      "An understanding of the nature and setting of this in-custody interrogation is essential to our decisions today. The difficulty in depicting what transpires at such interrogations stems from the fact that in this country they have largely taken place incommunicado. From extensive factual studies undertaken in the early 1930's, including the famous Wickersham Report to Congress by a Presidential Commission, it is clear that police violence and the 'third degree' flourished at that time.5 In a series of cases decided by this Court long after these studies, the police resorted to physical brutality—beatings, hanging, whipping—and to sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado in order to extort confessions.6 The Commission on Civil Rights in 1961 found much evidence to indicate that 'some policemen still resort to physical force to obtain confessions,' 1961 Comm'n on Civil Rights Rep., Justice, pt. 5, 17. The use of physical brutality and violence is not, unfortunately, relegated to the past or to any part of the country. Only recently in Kings County, New York, the police brutally beat, kicked and placed lighted cigarette butts on the back of a potential witness under interrogation for the purpose of securing a statement incriminating a third party. People v. Portelli, 15 N.Y.2d 235, 257 N.Y.S.2d 931, 205 N.E.2d 857 (1965).7\n",

      "The examples given above are undoubtedly the exception now, but they are sufficiently widespread to be the object of concern. Unless a proper limitation upon custodial interrogation is achieved—such as these decisions will advance—there can be no assurance that practices of this nature will be eradicated in the foreseeable future. The conclusion of the Wickersham Commission Report, made over 30 years ago, is still pertinent:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "14\n",
      "'To the contention that the third degree is necessary to get  the facts, the reporters aptly reply in the language of the  present Lord Chancellor of England (Lord Sankey): 'It is not  admissible to do a great right by doing a little wrong. * * *  It is not sufficient to do justice by obtaining a proper  result by irregular or improper means.' Not only does the use  of the third degree involve a flagrant violation of law by  the officers of the law, but it involves also the dangers of  false confessions, and it tends to make police and  prosecutors less zealous in the search for objective  evidence. As the New York prosecutor quoted in the report  said, 'It is a short cut and makes the police lazy and  unenterprising.' Or, as another official quoted remarked: 'If  you use your fists, you are not so likely to use your wits.' We agree with the  conclusion expressed in the report, that 'The third degree  brutalizes the police, hardens the prisoner against society,  and lowers the esteem in which the administration of justice  is held by the public.\" IV National Commission on Law  Observance and Enforcement, Report on Lawlessness in Law  Enforcement 5 (1931).\n",

      "Again we stress that the modern practice of in-custody interrogation is psychologically rather than physically oriented. As we have stated before, 'Since Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716, this Court has recognized that coercion can be mental as well as physical, and that the blood of the accused is not the only hallmark of an unconstitutional inquisition.' Blackburn v. State of Alabama, 361 U.S. 199, 206, 80 S.Ct. 274, 279, 4 L.Ed.2d 242 (1960). Interrogation still takes place in privacy. Privacy results in secrecy and this in turn results in a gap in our knowledge as to what in fact goes on in the interrogation rooms. A valuable source of information about present police practices, however, may be found in various police manuals and texts which document procedures employed with success in the past, and which recommend various other effective tactics.8 These texts are used by law enforcement agencies themselves as guides.9 It should be noted that these texts professedly present the most enlightened and effective means presently used to obtain statements through custodial interrogation. By considering these texts and other data, it is possible to describe procedures observed and noted around the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "16\n",
      "The officers are told by the manuals that the 'principal psychological factor contributing to a successful interrogation is privacy—being alone with the person under interrogation.'10 The efficacy of this tactic has been explained as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "17\n",
      "'If at all practicable, the interrogation should take place  in the investigator's office or at least in a room of his own  choice. The subject should be deprived of every psychological  advantage. In his own home he may be confident, indignant, or  recalcitrant. He is more keenly aware of his rights and more reluctant to tell of his indiscretions of criminal  behavior within the walls of his home. Moreover his family  and other friends are nearby, their presence lending moral  support. In his office, the investigator possesses all the  advantages. The atmosphere suggests the invincibility of the  forces of the law.'11\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "To highlight the isolation and unfamiliar surroundings, the manuals instruct the police to display an air of confidence in the suspect's guilt and from outward appearance to maintain only an interest in confirming certain details. The guilt of the subject is to be posited as a fact. The interrogator should direct his comments toward the reasons why the subject committed the act, rather than court failure by asking the subject whether he did it. Like other men, perhaps the subject has had a bad family life, had an unhappy childhood, had too much to drink, had an unrequited desire for women. The officers are instructed to minimize the moral seriousness of the offense,12 to cast blame on the victim or on society.13 These tactics are designed to put the subject in a psychological state where his story is but an elaboration of what the police purport to know already—that he is guilty. Explanations to the contrary are dismissed and discouraged.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "The texts thus stress that the major qualities an interrogator should possess are patience and perseverance. One writer describes the efficacy of these characteristics in this manner:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "'In the preceding paragraphs emphasis has been placed on  kindness and stratagems. The investigator will, however,  encounter many situations where the sheer weight of his  personality will be the deciding factor. Where emotional  appeals and tricks are employed to no avail, he must rely on  an oppressive atmosphere of dogged persistence. He must  interrogate steadily and without relent, leaving the subject  no prospect of surcease. He must dominate his subject and  overwhelm him with his inexorable will to obtain the truth.  He should interrogate for a spell of several hours pausing  only for the subject's necessities in acknowledgment of the  need to avoid a charge of duress that can be technically  substantiated. In a serious case, the interrogation may  continue for days, with the required intervals for food and  sleep, but with no respite from the atmosphere of domination.  It is possible in this way to induce the subject to talk  without resorting to duress or coercion. The method should be  used only when the guilt of the subject appears highly  probable.'14\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "The manuals suggest that the suspect be offered legal excuses for his actions in order to obtain an initial admission of guilt. Where there is a suspected revenge-killing, for example, the interrogator may say:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "'Joe, you probably didn't go out looking for this fellow with  the purpose of shooting him. My guess is, however, that you  expected something from him and that's why you carried a gun  for your own protection. You knew him for what he was, no  good. Then when you met him he probably started using foul,  abusive language and he gave some indication that he was about to pull a gun on you, and that's  when you had to act to save your own life. That's about it,  isn't it, Joe?'15\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "23\n",
      "Having then obtained the admission of shooting, the interrogator is advised to refer to circumstantial evidence which negates the self-defense explanation. This should enable him to secure the entire story. One text notes that 'Even if he fails to do so, the inconsistency between the subject's original denial of the shooting and his present admission of at least doing the shooting will serve to deprive him of a self-defense 'out' at the time of trial.'16\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "24\n",
      "When the techniques described above prove unavailing, the texts recommend they be alternated with a show of some hostility. One ploy often used has been termed the 'friendly-unfriendly' or the 'Mutt and Jeff' act:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "25\n",
      "'* * * In this technique, two agents are employed. Mutt, the  relentless investigator, who knows the subject is guilty and  is not going to waste any time. He's sent a dozen men away  for this crime and he's going to send the subject away for  the full term. Jeff, on the other hand, is obviously a  kindhearted man. He has a family himself. He has a brother  who was involved in a little scrape like this. He disapproves  of Mutt and his tactics and will arrange to get him off the  case if the subject will cooperate. He can't hold Mutt off  for very long. The subject would be wise to make a quick  decision. The technique is applied by having both  investigators present while Mutt acts out his role. Jeff may  stand by quietly and demur at some of Mutt's tactics. When  Jeff makes his plea for cooperation, Mutt is not present in  the room.'17\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "26\n",
      "The interrogators sometimes are instructed to induce a confession out of trickery. The technique here is quite effective in crimes which require identification or which run in series. In the identification situation, the interrogator may take a break in his questioning to place the subject among a group of men in a line-up. 'The witness or complainant (previously coached, if necessary) studies the line-up and confidently points out the subject as the guilty party.'18 Then the questioning resumes 'as though there were now no doubt about the guilt of the subject.' A variation on this technique is called the 'reverse line-up':\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "'The accused is placed in a line-up, but this time he is  identified by several fictitious witnesses or victims who  associated him with diferent offenses.

      "28\n",
      "The manuals also contain instructions for police on how to handle the individual who refuses to discuss the matter entirely, or who asks for an attorney or relatives. The examiner is to concede him the right to remain silent. 'This usually has a very undermining effect. First of all, he is disappointed in his expectation of an unfavorable reaction on the part of the interrogator. Secondly, a concession of this right to remain silent impresses the subject with the apparent fairness of his interrogator.'20 After this psychological conditioning, however, the officer is told to point out the incriminating significance of the suspect's refusal to talk:\n",
      "\n",

But let me ask you this. Suppose you were in my  shoes and I were in yours and you called me in to ask me  about this and I told you, 'I don't want to answer any of  your questions.' You'd think I had something to hide, and  you'd probably be right in thinking that. That's exactly what  I'll have to think about you, and so will everybody else. So  let's sit here and talk this whole thing over.'21\n",

The interrogator may also  add, 'Joe, I'm only looking for the truth, and if you're  telling the truth, that's it. You can handle this by  yourself.\"22\n",

      "From these representative samples of interrogation techniques, the setting prescribed by the manuals and observed in practice becomes clear. In essence, it is this: To be alone with the subject is essential to prevent distraction and to deprive him of any outside support. The aura of confidence in his guilt undermines his will to resist. He merely confirms the preconceived story the police seek to have him describe. Patience and persistence, at times relentless questioning, are employed. To obtain a confession, the interrogator must 'patiently maneuver himself or his quarry into a position from which the desired objective may be attained.'23 When normal procedures fail to produce the needed result, the police may resort to deceptive stratagems such as giving false legal advice. It is important to keep the subject off balance, for example, by trading on his insecurity about himself or his surroundings. The police then persuade, trick, or cajole him out of exercising his constitutional rights.\n",

      "Even without employing brutality, the 'third degree' or the specific stratagems described above, the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals.24 This fact may be illustrated simply by referring to three confession cases decided by this Court in the Term immediately preceding our Escobedo decision. In Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), the defendant was a 19-year-old heroin addict, described as a 'near mental defective,' id., at 307—310, 83 S.Ct. at 754—755. The defendant in Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922 (1963), was a woman who confessed to the arresting officer after being importuned to 'cooperate' in order to prevent her children from being taken by relief authorities. This Court as in those cases reversed the conviction of a defendant in Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963), whose persistent request during his interrogation was to phone his wife or attorney.25 In other settings, these individuals might have exercised their constitutional rights. In the incommunicado police-dominated atmosphere, they succumbed.\n",

      "In the cases before us today, given this backgound, we concern ourselves primarily with this interrogation atmosphere and the evils it can bring. In No. 759, Miranda v. Arizona, the police arrested the defendant and took him to a special interrogation room where they secured a confession. In No. 760, Vignera v. New York, the defendant made oral admissions to the police after interrogation in the afternoon, and then signed an inculpatory statement upon being questioned by an assistant district attorney later the same evening. In No. 761, Westover v. United States, the defendant was handed over to the Federal Bureau of Investigation by local authorities after they had detained and interrogated him for a lengthy period, both at night and the following morning. After some two hours of questioning, the federal officers had obtained signed statements from the defendant. Lastly, in No. 584, California v. Stewart, the local police held the defendant five days in the station and interrogated him on nine separate occasions before they secured his inculpatory statement.\n",

      "In these cases, we might not find the defendants' statements to have been involuntary in traditional terms. Our concern for adequate safeguards to protect precious Fifth Amendment rights is, of course, not lessened in the slightest. In each of the cases, the defendant was thrust into an unfamiliar atmosphere and run through menacing police interrogation procedures. The potentiality for compulsion is forcefully apparent, for example, in Miranda, where the indigent Mexican defendant was a seriously disturbed individual with pronounced sexual fantasies, and in Stewart, in which the defendant was an indigent Los Angeles Negro who had dropped out of school in the sixth grade. To be sure, the records do not evince overt physical coercion or patent psychological ploys. The fact remains that in none of these cases did the officers undertake to afford appropriate safeguards at the outset of the interrogation to insure that the statements were truly the product of free choice.\n",

      "It is obvious that such an interrogation environment is created for no purpose other than to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner. This atmosphere carries its own badge of intimidation. To be sure, this is not physical intimidation, but it is equally destructive of human dignity.26 The current practice of incommunicado interrogation is at odds with one of our Nation's most cherished principles—that the individual may not be compelled to incriminate himself. Unless adequate protective devices are employed to dispel the compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from the defendant can truly be the product of his free choice.\n",

      "We sometimes forget how long it has taken to establish the privilege against self-incrimination, the sources from which it came and the fervor with which it was defended. Its roots go back into ancient times.27 Perhaps the critical historical event shedding light on its origins and evolution was the trial of one John Lilburn, a vocal anti-Stuart Leveller, who was made to take the Star Chamber Oath in 1637. The oath would have bound him to answer to all questions posed to him on any subject. The Trial of John Lilburn and John Wharton, 3 How.St.Tr. 1315 (1637). He resisted the oath and declaimed the proceedings, stating:\n",

      "'Another fundamental right I then contended for, was, that no  man's conscience ought to be racked by oaths imposed, to  answer to questions concerning himself in matters criminal,  or pretended to be so.' Haller & Davies, The Leveller Tracts  1647—1653, p. 454 (1944).\n",

      "On account of the Lilburn Trial, Parliament abolished the inquisitorial Court of Star Chamber and went further in giving him generous reparation. The lofty principles to which Lilburn had appealed during his trial gained popular acceptance in England.28 These sentiments worked their way over to the Colonies and were implanted after great struggle into the Bill of Rights.29 Those who framed our Constitution and the Bill of Rights were ever aware of subtle encroachments on individual liberty. They knew that 'illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing * * * by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure.' Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524, 535, 29 L.Ed. 746 (1886). The privilege was elevated to constitutional status and has always been 'as broad ad the mischief against which it seeks to guard.' Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, 12 S.Ct. 195, 198, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). We cannot depart from this noble heritage.\n",

      "Thus we may view the historical development of the privilege as one which groped for the proper scope of governmental power over the citizen. As a 'noble principle often transcends its origins,' the privilege has come right-fully to be recognized in part as an individual's substantive right, a 'right to a private enclave where he may lead a private life. That right is the hallmark of our democracy.' United States v. Grunewald, 233 F.2d 556, 579, 581—582 (Frank, J., dissenting), rev'd, 353 U.S. 391, 77 S.Ct. 963, 1 L.Ed.2d 931 (1957). We have recently noted that the privilege against self-incrimination—the essential mainstay of our adversary system—is founded on a complex of values, Murphy v. Waterfront Comm. of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 55—57, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 1596—1597, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964); Tehan v. United States ex rel. Shott, 382 U.S. 406, 414—415, n. 12, 86 S.Ct. 459, 464, 15 L.Ed.2d 453 (1966). All these policies point to one overriding thought: the constitutional foundation underlying the privilege is the respect a government—state or federal—must accord to the dignity and integrity of its citizens. To maintain a 'fair state-individual balance,' to require the government 'to shoulder the entire load,' 8 Wigmore, Evidence 317 (McNaughton rev. 1961), to respect the inviolability of the human personality, our accusatory system of criminal justice demands that the government seeking to punish an individual produce the evidence against him by its own independent labors, rather than by the cruel, simple expedient of compelling it from his own mouth. Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 235—238, 60 S.Ct. 472, 476—477, 84 L.Ed. 716 (1940). In sum, the privilege is fulfilled only when the person is guaranteed the right 'to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will.' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964).\n",

      "The question in these cases is whether the privilege is fully applicable during a period of custodial interrogation. In this Court, the privilege has consistently been accorded a liberal construction. Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Board, 382 U.S. 70, 81, 86 S.Ct. 194, 200, 15 L.Ed.2d 165 (1965); Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S.Ct. 814, 818, 95 L.Ed.2d 1118 (1951); Arnstein v. McCarthy, 254 U.S. 71, 72—73, 41 S.Ct. 26, 65 L.Ed. 138 (1920); Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562, 12 S.Ct. 195, 197, 35 L.Ed. 1110 (1892). We are satisfied that all the principles embodied in the privilege apply to informal compulsion exerted by law-enforcement officers during in-custody questioning. An individual swept from familiar surroundings into police custody, surrounded by antagonistic forces, and subjected to the techniques of persuasion described above cannot be otherwise than under compulsion to speak. As a practical matter, the compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery.30\n",

These supervisory rules, requiring production of an arrested person before a commissioner 'without unnecessary delay' and excluding evidence obtained in default of that statutory obligation, were nonetheless responsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy that unavoidably face us now as to the States.

      "Our decision in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964), necessitates an examination of the scope of the privilege in state cases as well. In Malloy, we squarely held the privilege applicable to the States, and held that the substantive standards underlying the privilege applied with full force to state court proceedings. There, as in Murphy v. Waterfront Comm. of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 84 S.Ct. 1594, 12 L.Ed.2d 678 (1964), and Griffin v. State of California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106 (1965), we applied the existing Fifth Amendment standards to the case before us. Aside from the holding itself, the reasoning in Malloy made clear what had already become apparent—that the substantive and procedural safeguards surrounding admissibility of confessions in state cases had become exceedingly exacting, reflecting all the policies embedded in the privilege, 378 U.S., at 7—8, 84 S.Ct. at 1493.33 The voluntariness doctrine in the state cases, as Malloy indicates, encompasses all interrogation practices which are likely to exert such pressure upon an individual as to disable him from making a free and rational choice.34 The implications of this proposition were elaborated in our decision in Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, decided one week after Malloy applied the privilege to the States.\n",

      "Our holding there stressed the fact that the police had not advised the defendant of his constitutional privilege to remain silent at the outset of the interrogation, and we drew attention to that fact at several points in the decision, 378 U.S., at 483, 485, 491, 84 S.Ct. at 1761, 1762, 1765. This was no isolated factor, but an essential ingredient in our decision. The entire thrust of police interrogation there, as in all the cases today, was to put the defendant in such an emotional state as to impair his capacity for rational judgment. The abdication of the constitutional privilege—the choice on his part to speak to the police—was not made knowingly or competently because of the failure to apprise him of his rights; the compelling atmosphere of the in-custody interrogation, and not an independent decision on his part, caused the defendant to speak.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "54\n",
      "A different phase of the Escobedo decision was significant in its attention to the absence of counsel during the questioning. There, as in the cases today, we sought a protective device to dispel the compelling atmosphere of the interrogation. In Escobedo, however, the police did not relieve the defendant of the anxieties which they had created in the interrogation rooms. Rather, they denied his request for the assistance of counsel, 378 U.S., at 481, 488, 491, 84 S.Ct. at 1760, 1763, 1765.35 This heightened his dilemma, and made his later statements the product of this compulsion. Cf. Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 514, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1343 (1963). The denial of the defendant's request for his attorney thus undermined his ability to exercise the privilege—to remain silent if he chose or to speak without any intimidation, blatant or subtle. The presence of counsel, in all the cases before us today, would be the adequate protective device necessary to make the process of police interrogation conform to the dictates of the privilege. His presence would insure that statements made in the government-established atmosphere are not the product of compulsion.\n",

      "It was in this manner that Escobedo explicated another facet of the pre-trial privilege, noted in many of the Court's prior decisions: the protection of rights at trial.36 That counsel is present when statements are taken from an individual during interrogation obviously enhances the integrity of the fact-finding processes in court. The presence of an attorney, and the warnings delivered to the individual, enable the defendant under otherwise compelling circumstances to tell his story without fear, effectively, and in a way that eliminates the evils in the interrogation process. Without the protections flowing from adequate warning and the rights of counsel, 'all the careful safeguards erected around the giving of testimony, whether by an accused or any other witness, would become empty formalities in a procedure where the most compelling possible evidence of guilt, a confession, would have already been obtained at the unsupervised pleasure of the police.'

      "Today, then, there can be no doubt that the Fifth Amendment privilege is available outside of criminal court proceedings and serves to protect persons in all settings in which their freedom of action is curtailed in any significant way from being compelled to incriminate themselves. We have concluded that without proper safeguards the process of in-custody interrogation of persons suspected or accused of crime contains inherently compelling pressures which work to undermine the individual's will to resist and to compel him to speak where he would not otherwise do so freely. In order to combat these pressures and to permit a full opportunity to exercise the privilege against self-incrimination, the accused must be adequately and effectively apprised of his rights and the exercise of those rights must be fully honored.\n",

Therefore we cannot say that the Constitution necessarily requires adherence to any particular solution for the inherent compulsions of the interrogation process as it is presently conducted. Our decision in no way creates a constitutional straitjacket which will handicap sound efforts at reform, nor is it intended to have this effect. We encourage Congress and the States to continue their laudable search for increasingly effective ways of protecting the rights of the individual while promoting efficient enforcement of our criminal laws. However, unless we are shown other procedures which are at least as effective in apprising accused persons of their right of silence and in assuring a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following safeguards must be observed.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "58\n",
      "At the outset, if a person in custody is to be subjected to interrogation, he must first be informed in clear and unequivocal terms that he has the right to remain silent. For those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed simply to make them aware of it—the threshold requirement for an intelligent decision as to its exercise. More important, such a warning is an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere. It is not just the subnormal or woefully ignorant who succumb to an interrogator's imprecations, whether implied or expressly stated, that the interrogation will continue until a confession is obtained or that silence in the face of accusation is itself damning and will bode ill when presented to a jury.37 Further, the warning will show the individual that his interrogators are prepared to recognize his privilege should he choose to exercise it.\n",

      "\n",
      "59\n",
      "The Fifth Amendment privilege is so fundamental to our system of constitutional rule and the expedient of giving an adequate warning as to the availability of the privilege so simple, we will not pause to inquire in individual cases whether the defendant was aware of his rights without a warning being given. Assessments of the knowledge the defendant possessed, based on information as to his age, education, intelligence, or prior contact with authorities, can never be more than speculation;38 a warning is a clearcut fact. More important, whatever the background of the person interrogated, a warning at the time of the interrogation is indispensable to overcome its pressures and to insure that the individual knows he is free to exercise the privilege at that point in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "60\n",
      "The warning of the right to remain silent must be accompanied by the explanation that anything said can and will be used against the individual in court. This warning is needed in order to make him aware not only of the privilege, but also of the consequences of forgoing it. It is only through an awareness of these consequences that there can be any assurance of real understanding and intelligent exercise of the privilege. Moreover, this warning may serve to make the individual more acutely aware that he is faced with a phase of the adversary system—that he is not in the presence of persons acting solely in his interest.\n",

      "The circumstances surrounding in-custody interrogation can operate very quickly to overbear the will of one merely made aware of his privilege by his interrogators. Therefore, the right to have counsel present at the interrogation is indispensable to the protection of the Fifth Amendment privilege under the system we delineate today. Our aim is to assure that the individual's right to choose between silence and speech remains unfettered throughout the interrogation process. A once-stated warning, delivered by those who will conduct the interrogation, cannot itself suffice to that end among those who most require knowledge of their rights. A mere warning given by the interrogators is not alone sufficient to accomplish that end. Prosecutors themselves claim that the admonishment of the right to remain silent without more 'will benefit only the recidivist and the professional.' Brief for the National District Attorneys Association as amicus curiae, p. 14. Even preliminary advice given to the accused by his own attorney can be swiftly overcome by the secret interrogation process. Cf. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 485, n. 5, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1762. Thus, the need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege comprehends not merely a right to consult with counsel prior to questioning, but also to have counsel present during any questioning if the defendant so desires.\n",

      "The presence of counsel at the interrogation may serve several significant subsidiary functions as well. If the accused decides to talk to his interrogators, the assistance of counsel can mitigate the dangers of untrustworthiness. With a lawyer present the likelihood that the police will practice coercion is reduced, and if coercion is nevertheless exercised the lawyer can testify to it in court. The presence of a lawyer can also help to guarantee that the accused gives a fully accurate statement to the police and that the statement is rightly reported by the prosecution at trial. See Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 443—448, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 1293—1296, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448 (1958) (Douglas, J., dissenting).\n",

      "An individual need not make a pre-interrogation request for a lawyer. While such request affirmatively secures his right to have one, his failure to ask for a lawyer does not constitute a waiver. No effective waiver of the right to counsel during interrogation can be recognized unless specifically made after the warnings we here delineate have been given.

This proposition applies with equal force in the context of providing counsel to protect an accused's Fifth Amendment privilege in the face of interrogation.39 Although the role of counsel at trial differs from the role during interrogation, the differences are not relevant to the question whether a request is a prerequisite.\n",

As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and that anything stated can be used in evidence against him, this warning is an absolute prerequisite to interrogation.

The financial ability of the individual has no relationship to the scope of the rights involved here. The privilege against self-incrimination secured by the Constitution applies to all individuals. The need for counsel in order to protect the privilege exists for the indigent as well as the affluent. In fact, were we to limit these constitutional rights to those who can retain an attorney, our decisions today would be of little significance. The cases before us as well as the vast majority of confession cases with which we have dealt in the past involve those unable to retain counsel.40 While authorities are not required to relieve the accused of his poverty, they have the obligation not to take advantage of indigence in the administration of justice.41 Denial of counsel to the indigent at the time of interrogation while allowing an attorney to those who can afford one would be no more supportable by reason or logic than the similar situation at trial and on appeal struck down in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), and Douglas v. People of State of California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963).\n",

Without this additional warning, the admonition of the right to consult with counsel would often be understood as meaning only that he can consult with a lawyer if he has one or has the funds to obtain one. The warning of a right to counsel would be hollow if not couched in terms that would convey to the indigent—the person most often subjected to interrogation—the knowledge that he too has a right to have counsel present.42 As with the warnings of the right to remain silent and of the general right to counsel, only by effective and express explanation to the indigent of this right can there be assurance that he was truly in a position to exercise it.43\n",

If the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.44 At this point he has shown that he intends to exercise his Fifth Amendment privilege; any statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise. Without the right to cut off questioning, the setting of in-custody interrogation operates on the individual to overcome free choice in producing a statement after the privilege has been once invoked. If the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present. At that time, the individual must have an opportunity to confer with the attorney and to have him present during any subsequent questioning. If the individual cannot obtain an attorney and he indicates that he wants one before speaking to police, they must respect his decision to remain silent.\n",

It does mean, however, that if police propose to interrogate a person they must make known to him that he is entitled to a lawyer and that if he cannot afford one, a lawyer will be provided for him prior to any interrogation. If authorities conclude that they will not provide counsel during a reasonable period of time in which investigation in the field is carried out, they may refrain from doing so without violating the person's Fifth Amendment privilege so long as they do not question him during that time.\n",

In these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so. It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege. Moreover, any evidence that the accused was threatened, tricked, or cajoled into a waiver will, of course, show that the defendant did not voluntarily waive his privilege. The requirement of warnings and waiver of rights is a fundamental with respect to the Fifth Amendment privilege and not simply a preliminary ritual to existing methods of interrogation.\n",

No distinction can be drawn between statements which are direct confessions and statements which amount to 'admissions' of part or all of an offense. The privilege against self-incrimination protects the individual from being compelled to incriminate himself in any manner; it does not distinguish degrees of incrimination. Similarly, for precisely the same reason, no distinction may be drawn between inculpatory statements and statements alleged to be merely 'exculpatory.' If a statement made were in fact truly exculpatory it would, of course, never be used by the prosecution. In fact, statements merely intended to be exculpatory by the defendant are often used to impeach his testimony at trial or to demonstrate untruths in the statement given under interrogation and thus to prove guilt by implication. These statements are incriminating in any meaningful sense of the word and may not be used without the full warnings and effective waiver required for any other statement. In Escobedo itself, the defendant fully intended his accusation of another as the slayer to be exculpatory as to himself.\n",

It is at this point that our adversary system of criminal proceedings commences, distinguishing itself at the outset from the inquisitorial system recognized in some countries.

When an individual is in custody on probable cause, the police may, of course, seek out evidence in the field to be used at trial against him. Such investigation may include inquiry of persons not under restraint. General on-the-scene questioning as to facts surrounding a crime or other general questioning of citizens in the fact-finding process is not affected by our holding. It is an act of responsible citizenship for individuals to give whatever information they may have to aid in law enforcement. In such situations the compelling atmosphere inherent in the process of in-custody interrogation is not necessarily present.46\n",

      "In dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible. Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime,47 or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today.\n",

      "To summarize, we hold that when an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way and is subjected to questioning, the privilege against self-incrimination is jeopardized. Procedural safeguards must be employed to protect the privilege and unless other fully effective means are adopted to notify the person of his right of silence and to assure that the exercise of the right will be scrupulously honored, the following measures are required. He must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. Opportunity to exercise these rights must be afforded to him throughout the interrogation. After such warnings have been given, and such opportunity afforded him, the individual may knowingly and intelligently waive these rights and agree to answer questions or make a statement. But unless and until such warnings and waiver are demonstrated by the prosecution at trial, no evidence obtained as a result of interrogation can be used against him.48\n",

The whole thrust of our foregoing discussion demonstrates that the Constitution has prescribed the rights of the individual when confronted with the power of government when it provided in the Fifth Amendment that an individual cannot be compelled to be a witness against himself.

An attorney may advise his client not to talk to police until he has had an opportunity to investigate the case, or he may wish to be present with his client during any police questioning. In doing so an attorney is merely exercising the good professional judgment he has been taught. This is not cause for considering the attorney a menace to law enforcement. He is merely carrying out what he is sworn to do under his oath—to protect to the extent of his ability the rights of his client. In fulfilling this responsibility the attorney plays a vital role in the administration of criminal justice under our Constitution.\n",

We also fully recognize the obligation of all citizens to aid in enforcing the criminal laws. This Court, while protecting individual rights, has always given ample latitude to law enforcement agencies in the legitimate exercise of their duties. The limits we have placed on the interrogation process should not constitute an undue interference with a proper system of law enforcement. As we have noted, our decision does not in any way preclude police from carrying out their traditional investigatory functions. Although confessions may play an important role in some convictions, the cases before us present graphic examples of the overstatement of the 'need' for confessions. In each case authorities conducted interrogations ranging up to five days in duration despite the presence, through standard investigating practices, of considerable evidence against each defendant.51 Further examples are chronicled in our prior cases. See, e.g., Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 518 519, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1345, 1346, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963); Rogers v.

      "It is also urged that an unfettered right to detention for interrogation should be allowed because it will often redound to the benefit of the person questioned. When police inquiry determines that there is no reason to believe that the person has committed any crime, it is said, he will be released without need for further formal procedures. The person who has committed no offense, however, will be better able to clear himself after warnings with counsel present than without. It can be assumed that in such circumstances a lawyer would advise his client to talk freely to police in order to clear himself.\n",

      "Custodial interrogation, by contrast, does not necessarily afford the innocent an opportunity to clear themselves. A serious consequence of the present practice of the interrogation alleged to be beneficial for the innocent is that many arrests 'for investigation' subject large numbers of innocent persons to detention and interrogation. In one of the cases before us, No. 584, California v. Stewart, police held four persons, who were in the defendant's house at the time of the arrest, in jail for five days until defendant confessed. At that time they were finally released. Police stated that there was 'no evidence to connect them with any crime.' Available statistics on the extent of this practice where it is condoned indicate that these four are far from alone in being subjected to arrest, prolonged detention, and interrogation without the requisite probable cause.53\n",

Conditions of law enforcement in our country are sufficiently similar to permit reference to this experience as assurance that lawlessness will not result from warning an individual of his rights or allowing him to exercise them. Moreover, it is consistent with our legal system that we give at least as much protection to these rights as is given in the jurisdictions described. We deal in our country with rights grounded in a specific requirement of the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, whereas other jurisdictions arrived at their conclusions on the basis of principles of justice not so specifically defined.64\n",

Congress and the States are free to develop their own safeguards for the privilege, so long as they are fully as effective as those described above in informing accused persons of their right of silence and in affording a continuous opportunity to exercise it. In any event, however, the issues presented are of constitutional dimensions and must be determined by the courts. The admissibility of a statement in the face of a claim that it was obtained in violation of the defendant's constitutional rights is an issue the resolution of which has long since been undertaken by this Court. See Hopt v. People of Territory of Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884). Judicial solutions to problems of constitutional dimension have evolved decade by decade.

The police then took him to 'Interrogation Room No. 2' of the detective bureau. There he was questioned by two police officers. The officers admitted at trial that Miranda was not advised that he had a right to have an attorney present.66 Two hours later, the officers emerged from the interrogation room with a written confession signed by Miranda. At the top of the statement was a typed paragraph stating that the confession was made voluntarily, without threats or promises of immunity and 'with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me.'67\n",

Miranda was found guilty of kidnapping and rape. He was sentenced to 20 to 30 years' imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that Miranda's constitutional rights were not violated in obtaining the confession and affirmed the conviction. 98 Ariz. 18, 401 P.2d 721. In reaching its decision, the court emphasized heavily the fact that Miranda did not specifically request counsel.\n",

From the testimony of the officers and by the admission of respondent, it is clear that Miranda was not in any way apprised of his right to consult with an attorney and to have one present during the interrogation, nor was his right not to be compelled to incriminate himself effectively protected in any other manner. Without these warnings the statements were inadmissible. The mere fact that he signed a statement which contained a typed-in clause stating that he had 'full knowledge' of his 'legal rights' does not approach the knowing and intelligent waiver required to relinquish constitutional rights.

      "110\n",
      "Petitioner, Michael Vignera, was picked up by New York police on October 14, 1960, in connection with the robbery three days earlier of a Brooklyn dress shop. They took him to the 17th Detective Squad headquarters in Manhattan. Sometime thereafter he was taken to the 66th Detective Squad. There a detective questioned Vignera with respect to the robbery. Vignera orally admitted the robbery to the detective. The detective was asked on cross-examination at trial by defense counsel whether Vignera was warned of his right to counsel before being interrogated. The prosecution objected to the question and the trial judge sustained the objection. Thus, the defense was precluded from making any showing that warnings had not been given. While at the 66th Detective Squad, Vignera was identified by the store owner and a saleslady as the man who robbed the dress shop. At about 3 p.m. he was formally arrested. The police then transported him to still another station, the 70th Precinct in Brooklyn, 'for detention.' At 11 p.m. Vignera was questioned by an assistant district attorney in the presence of a hearing reporter who transcribed the questions and Vignera's answers. This verbatim account of these proceedings contains no statement of any warnings given by the assistant district attorney. At Vignera's trial on a charge of first degree robbery, the detective testified as to the oral confession. The transcription of the statement taken was also introduced in evidence. At the conclusion of the testimony, the trial judge charged the jury in part as follows:\n",

      "111\n",

      "115\n",
      "At approximately 9:45 p.m. on March 20, 1963, petitioner, Carl Calvin Westover, was arrested by local police in Kansas City as a suspect in two Kansas City robberies. A report was also received from the FBI that he was wanted on a felony charge in California. The local authorities took him to a police station and placed him in a line-up on the local charges, and at about 11:45 p.m. he was booked. Kansas City police interrogated Westover on the night of his arrest. He denied any knowledge of criminal activities. The next day local officers interrogated him again throughout the morning. Shortly before noon they informed the FBI that they were through interrogating Westover and that the FBI could proceed to interrogate him. There is nothing in the record to indicate that Westover was ever given any warning as to his rights by local police. At noon, three special agents of the FBI continued the interrogation in a private interview room of the Kansas City Police Department, this time with respect to the robbery of a savings and loan association and a bank in Sacramento, California. After two or two and one-half hours, Westover signed separate confessions to each of these two robberies which had been prepared by one of the agents during the interrogation. At trial one of the agents testified, and a paragraph on each of the statements states, that the agents advised Westover that he did not have to make a statement, that any statement he made could be used against him, and that he had the right to see an attorney.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "116\n",
      "Westover was tried by a jury in federal court and convicted of the California robberies. His statements were introduced at trial.

      "We reverse. On the facts of this case we cannot find that Westover knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent and his right to consult with counsel prior to the time he made the statement.69 At the time the FBI agents began questioning Westover, he had been in custody for over 14 hours and had been interrogated at length during that period. The FBI interrogation began immediately upon the conclusion of the interrogation by Kansas City police and was conducted in local police headquarters. Although the two law enforcement authorities are legally distinct and the crimes for which they interrogated Westover were different, the impact on him was that of a continuous period of questioning. There is no evidence of any warning given prior to the FBI interrogation nor is there any evidence of an articulated waiver of rights after the FBI commenced its interrogation. The record simply shows that the defendant did in fact confess a short time after being turned over to the FBI following interrogation by local police. Despite the fact that the FBI agents gave warnings at the outset of their interview, from Westover's point of view the warnings came at the end of the interrogation process. In these circumstances an intelligent waiver of constitutional rights cannot be assumed.\n",

      "We do not suggest that law enforcement authorities are precluded from questioning any individual who has been held for a period of time by other authorities and interrogated by them without appropriate warnings. A different case would be presented if an accused were taken into custody by the second authority, removed both in time and place from his original surroundings, and then adequately advised of his rights and given an opportunity to exercise them. But here the FBI interrogation was conducted immediately following the state interrogation in the same police station—in the same compelling surroundings. Thus, in obtaining a confession from Westover the federal authorities were the beneficiaries of the pressure applied by the local in-custody interrogation. In these circumstances the giving of warnings alone was not sufficient to protect the privilege.\n",

At about 7:15 p.m., January 31, 1963, police officers went to Stewart's house and arrested him. One of the officers asked Stewart if they could search the house, to which he replied, 'Go ahead.' The search turned up various items taken from the five robbery victims. At the time of Stewart's arrest, police also arrested Stewart's wife and three other persons who were visiting him. These four were jailed along with Stewart and were interrogated. Stewart was taken to the University Station of the Los Angeles Police Department where he was placed in a cell. During the next five days, police interrogated Stewart on nine different occasions.

However, I am unable to join the majority because its opinion goes too far on too little, while my dissenting brethren do not go quite far enough. Nor can I join in the Court's criticism of the present practices of police and investigatory agencies as to custodial interrogation. The materials it refers to as 'police manuals'1 are, as I read them, merely writings in this filed by professors and some police officers. Not one is shown by the record here to be the official manual of any police department, much less in universal use in crime detection. Moreover the examples of police brutality mentioned by the Court2 are rare exceptions to the thousands of cases that appear every year in the law reports. The police agencies—all the way from municipal and state forces to the federal bureaus—are responsible for law enforcement and public safety in this country.

      "The ipse dixit of the majority has no support in our cases. Indeed, the Court admits that 'we might not find the defendants' statements (here) to have been involuntary in traditional terms.' Ante, p. 457. In short, the Court has added more to the requirements that the accused is entitled to consult with his lawyer and that he must be given the traditional warning that he may remain silent and that anything that he says may be used against him. Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 490—491, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1764—1765, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964). Now, the Court fashions a constitutional rule that the police may engage in no custodial interrogation without additionally advising the accused that he has a right under the Fifth Amendment to the presence of counsel during interrogation and that, if he is without funds, counsel will be furnished him. When at any point during an interrogation the accused seeks affirmatively or impliedly to invoke his rights to silence or counsel, interrogation must be forgone or postponed. The Court further holds that failure to follow the new procedures requires inexorably the exclusion of any statement by the accused, as well as the fruits thereof. Such a strict constitutional specific inserted at the nerve center of crime detection may well kill the patient.3 Since there is at this time a paucity of information and an almost total lack of empirical knowledge on the practical operation of requirements truly comparable to those announced by the majority, I would be more restrained lest we go too far too fast.\n",

      "Custodial interrogation has long been recognized as 'undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.' Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 515, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1344, 10 L.Ed.2d 513 (1963). Recognition of this fact should put us on guard against the promulgation of doctrinaire rules. Especially is this true where the Court finds that 'the Constitution has prescribed' its holding and where the light of our past cases, from Hopt v. People of Territory of Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262 (1884), down to Haynes v. State of Washington, supra, is to the contrary. Indeed, even in Escobedo the Court never hinted that an affirmative 'waiver' was a prerequisite to questioning; that the burden of proof as to waiver was on the prosecution; that the presence of counsel—absent a waiver—during interrogation was required; that a waiver can be withdrawn at the will of the accused; that counsel must be furnished during an accusatory stage to those unable to pay; nor that admissions and exculpatory statements are 'confessions.' To require all those things at one gulp should cause the Court to choke over more cases than Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448 (1958), and Cicenia v.

The line between  proper and permissible police conduct and techniques and  methods offensive to due process is, at best, a difficult one  to draw, particularly in cases such as this where it is  necessary to make fine judgments as to the effect of  psychologically coercive pressures and inducements on the  mind and will of an accused. * * * We are here impelled to  the conclusion, from all of the facts presented, that the  bounds of due process have been exceeded.'

In the absence of warnings, the burden would be on the State to prove that counsel was knowingly and intelligently waived or that in the totality of the circumstances, including the failure to give the necessary warnings, the confession was clearly voluntary.\n",

      "I. INTRODUCTION\n",
      "\n",
      "139\n",
      "At the outset, it is well to note exactly what is required by the Court's new constitutional code of rules for confessions. The foremost requirement, upon which later admissibility of a confession depends, is that a fourfold warning be given to a person in custody before he is questioned, namely, that he has a right to remain silent, that anything he says may be used against him, that he has a right to have present an attorney during the questioning, and that if indigent he has a right to a lawyer without charge. To forgo these rights, some affirmative statement of rejection is seemingly required, and threats, tricks, or cajolings to obtain this waiver are forbidden. If before or during questioning the suspect seeks to invoke his right to remain silent, interrogation must be forgone or cease; a request for counsel brings about the same result until a lawyer is procured. Finally, there are a miscellany of minor directives, for example, the burden of proof of waiver is on the State, admissions and exculpatory statements are treated just like confessions, withdrawal of a waiver is always permitted, and so forth.1\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "140\n",
      "While the fine points of this scheme are far less clear than the Court admits, the tenor is quite apparent. The new rules are not designed to guard against police brutality or other unmistakably banned forms of coercion. Those who use third-degree tactics and deny them in court are equally able and destined to lie as skillfully about warnings and waivers. Rather, the thrust of the new rules is to negate all pressures, to reinforce the nervous or ignorant suspect, and ultimately to discourage any confession at all. The aim in short is toward 'voluntariness' in a utopian sense, or to view it from a different angle, voluntariness with a vengeance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "141\n",
      "To incorporate this notion into the Constitution requires a strained reading of history and precedent and a disregard of the very pragmatic concerns that alone may on occasion justify such strains. I believe that reasoned examination will show that the Due Process Clauses provide an adequate tool for coping with confessions and that, even if the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination be invoked, its precedents taken as a whole do not sustain the present rules. Viewed as a choice based on pure policy, these new rules prove to be a highly debatable, if not one-sided, appraisal of the competing interests, imposed over widespread objection, at the very time when judicial restraint is most called for by the circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "II. CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISES.\n",
      "\n",
      "142\n",
      "It is most fitting to begin an inquiry into the constitutional precedents by surverying the limits on confessions the Court has evolved under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This is so because these cases show that there exists a workable and effective means of dealing with confessions in a judicial manner; because the cases are the baseline from which the Court now departs and so serve to measure the actual as opposed to the professed distance it travels; and because examination of them helps reveal how the Court has coasted into its present position.\n",

      "\n",
      "143\n",
      "The earliest confession cases in this Court emerged from federal prosecutions and were settled on a nonconstitutional basis, the Court adopting the common-law rule that the absence of inducements, promises, and threats made a confession voluntary and admissible. Hopt v. People, of Territory of Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 4 S.Ct. 202, 28 L.Ed. 262; Pierce v. United States, 160 U.S. 355, 16 S.Ct. 321, 40 L.Ed. 454. While a later case said the Fifth Amendment privilege controlled admissibility, this proposition was not itself developed in subsequent decisions.2 The Court did, however, heighten the test of admissibility in federal trials to one of voluntariness 'in fact,' Ziang Sung Wan v. United States, 266 U.S. 1, 14, 45 S.Ct. 1, 3, 69 L.Ed. 131 (quoted, ante, p. 462), and then by and large left federal judges to apply the same standards the Court began to derive in a string of state court cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "144\n",
      "This new line of decisions, testing admissibility by the Due Process Clause, began in 1936 with Brown v. State of Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 56 S.Ct. 461, 80 L.Ed. 682, and must now embrace somewhat more than 30 full opinions of the Court.3 While the voluntariness rubric was repeated in many instances, e.g., Lyons v. State of Oklahoma, 322 U.S. 596, 64 S.Ct. 1208, 88 L.Ed. 1481, the Court never pinned it down to a single meaning but on the contrary infused it with a number of different values. To travel quickly over the main themes, there was an initial emphasis on reliability, e.g., Ward v. State of Texas, 316 U.S. 547, 62 S.Ct. 1139, 86 L.Ed. 1663, supplemented by concern over the legality and fairness of the police practices, e.g., Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 64 S.Ct. 921, 88 L.Ed. 1192, in an 'accusatorial' system of law enforcement, Watts v. State of Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 54, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 1350, 93 L.Ed. 1801, and eventually by close attention to the individual's state of mind and capacity for effective choice, e.g., Gallegos v. State of Colorado, 370 U.S. 49, 82 S.Ct. 1209, 8 L.Ed.2d 325. The outcome was a continuing re-evaluation on the facts of each case of how much pressure on the suspect was permissible.4\n",

      "Among the criteria often taken into account were threats or imminent danger, e.g., Payne v. State of Arkansas, 356 U.S. 560, 78 S.Ct. 844, 2 L.Ed.2d 975, physical deprivations such as lack of sleep or food, e.g., Reck v. Pate, 367 U.S. 433, 81 S.Ct. 1541, 6 L.Ed.2d 948, repeated or extended interrogation, e.g., Chambers v. State of Florida, 309 U.S. 227, 60 S.Ct. 472, 84 L.Ed. 716, limits on access to counsel or friends, Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 2 L.Ed.2d 1448; Cicenia v. La. Gay, 357 U.S. 504, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523, length and illegality of detention under state law, e.g., Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 10 L.Ed.2d 513, and individual weakness or incapacities, Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 83 S.Ct. 917, 9 L.Ed.2d 922. Apart from direct physical coercion, however, no single default or fixed combination of defaults guaranteed exclusion, and synopses of the cases would serve little use because the overall gauge has been steadily changing, usually in the direction of restricting admissibility. But to mark just what point had been reached before the Court jumped the rails in Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977, it is worth capsulizing the then-recent case of Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336. There, Haynes had been held some 16 or more hours in violation of state law before signing the disputed confession, had received no warnings of any kind, and despite requests had been refused access to his wife or to counsel, the police indicating that access would be allowed after a confession. Emphasizing especially this last inducement and rejecting some contrary indicia of voluntariness, the Court in a 5-to-4 decision held the confession inadmissible.\n",

      "There are several relevant lessons to be drawn from this constitutional history. The first is that with over 25 years of precedent the Court has developed an elaborate, sophisticated, and sensitive approach to admissibility of confessions. It is 'judicial' in its treatment of one case at a time, see Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 635, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1896, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (concurring opinion of The Chief Justice), flexible in its ability to respond to the endless mutations of fact presented, and ever more familiar to the lower courts. Of course, strict certainty is not obtained in this developing process, but this is often so with constitutional principles, and disagreement is usually confined to that borderland of close cases where it matters least.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "147\n",
      "The second point is that in practice and from time to time in principle, the Court has given ample recognition to society's interest in suspect questioning as an instrument of law enforcement. Cases countenancing quite significant pressures can be cited without difficulty,5 and the lower courts may often have been yet more tolerant. Of course the limitations imposed today were rejected by necessary implication in case after case, the right to warnings having been explicitly rebuffed in this Court many years ago. Powers v. United States, 223 U.S. 303, 32 S.Ct. 281, 56 L.Ed. 448; Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 16 S.Ct. 895, 40 L.Ed. 1090. As recently as Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 515, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1344, the Court openly acknowledged that questioning of witnesses and suspects 'is undoubtedly an essential tool in effective law enforcement.' Accord, Crooker v. State of California, 357 U.S. 433, 441, 78 S.Ct. 1287, 1292.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "148\n",
      "Finally, the cases disclose that the language in many of the opinions overstates the actual course of decision. It has been said, for example, that an admissible confession must be made by the suspect 'in the unfettered exercise of his own will,' Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S.Ct. 1489, 1493, 12 L.Ed.2d 653, and that 'a prisoner is not 'to be made the deluded instrument of his own coniviction,\" Culombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 581, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 1867, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (Frankfurter, J., announcing the Court's judgment and an opinion). Though often repeated, such principles are rarely observed in full measure. Even the word 'voluntary' may be deemed somewhat misleading, especially when one considers many of the confessions that have been brought under its umbrella. See, e.g., supra, n. 5. The tendency to overstate may be laid in part to the flagrant facts often before the Court; but in any event one must recognize how it has tempered attitudes and lent some color of authority to the approach now taken by the Court.\n",

      "\n",
      "149\n",
      "I turn now to the Court's asserted reliance on the Fifth Amendment, an approach which I frankly regard as a trompe l'oeil. The Court's opinion in my view reveals no adequate basis for extending the Fifth Amendment's privilege against self-incrimination to the police station. Far more important, it fails to show that the Court's new rules are well supported, let alone compelled, by Fifth Amendment precedents. Instead, the new rules actually derive from quotation and analogy drawn from precedents under the Sixth Amendment, which should properly have no bearing on police interrogation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "150\n",
      "The Court's opening contention, that the Fifth Amendment governs police station confessions, is perhaps not an impermissible extension of the law but it has little to commend itself in the present circumstances. Historically, the privilege against self-incrimination did not bear at all on the use of extra-legal confessions, for which distinct standards evolved; indeed, 'the history of the two principles is wide apart, differing by one hundred years in origin, and derived through separate lines of precedents. * * *' 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2266, at 401 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Practice under the two doctrines has also differed in a number of important respects.6 Even those who would readily enlarge the privilege must concede some linguistic difficulties since the Fifth Amendment in terms proscribes only compelling any person 'in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.' Cf. Kamisar, Equal Justice in the Gatehouses and Mansions of American Criminal Procedure, in Criminal Justice in Our Time 1, 25—26 (1965).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "151\n",
      "Though weighty, I do not say these points and similar ones are conclusive, for, as the Court reiterates, the privilege embodies basic principles always capable of expansion.7 Certainly the privilege does represent a protective concern for the accused and an emphasis upon accusatorial rather than inquisitorial values in law enforcement, although this is similarly true of other limitations such as the grand jury requirement and the reasonable doubt standard. Accusatorial values, however, have openly been absorbed into the due process standard governing confessions; this indeed is why at present 'the kinship of the two rules (governing confessions and self-incrimination) is too apparent for denial.' McCormick, Evidence 155 (1954). Since extension of the general principle has already occurred, to insist that the privilege applies as such serves only to carry over inapposite historical details and engaging rhetoric and to obscure the policy choices to be made in regulating confessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "152\n",
      "Having decided that the Fifth Amendment privilege does apply in the police station, the Court reveals that the privilege imposes more exacting restrictions than does the Fourteenth Amendment's voluntariness test.8 It then emerges from a discussion of Escobedo that the Fifth Amendment requires for an admissible confession that it be given by one distinctly aware of his right not to speak and shielded from 'the compelling atmosphere' of interrogation. See ante, pp. 465—466. From these key premises, the Court finally develops the safeguards of warning, counsel, and so forth. I do not believe these premises are sustained by precedents under the Fifth Amendment.9\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "153\n",
      "The more important premise is that pressure on the suspect must be eliminated though it be only the subtle influence of the atmosphere and surroundings. The Fifth Amendment, however, has never been thought to forbid all pressure to incriminate one's self in the situations covered by it. On the contrary, it has been held that failure to incriminate one's self can result in denial of removal of one's case from state to federal court, State of Maryland v. Soper, 270 U.S. 9, 46 S.Ct. 185, 70 L.Ed. 449; in refusal of a military commission, Orloff v. Willoughby, 345 U.S 83, 73 S.Ct. 534, 97 L.Ed. 842; in denial of a discharge in bankruptcy, Kaufman v. Hurwitz, 4 Cir., 176 F.2d 210; and in numerous other adverse consequences. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2272, at 441—444, n. 18 (McNaughton rev. 1961); Maguire, Evidence of Guilt § 2.062 (1959). This is not to say that short of jail or torture any sanction is permissible in any case; policy and history alike may impose sharp limits. See, e.g., Griffin v. State of California, 380 U.S. 609, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106. However, the Court's unspoken assumption that any pressure violates the privilege is not supported by the precedents and it has failed to show why the Fifth Amendment prohibits that relatively mild pressure the Due Process Clause permits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "154\n",
      "The Court appears similarly wrong in thinking that precise knowledge of one's rights is a settled prerequisite under the Fifth Amendment to the loss of its protections. A number of lower federal court cases have held that grand jury witnesses need not always be warned of their privilege, e.g., United States v. Scully, 2 Cir., 225 F.2d 113, 116, and Wigmore states this to be the better rule for trial witnesses. See 8 Wigmore, Evidence § 2269 (McNaughton rev. 1961). Cf. Henry v. State of Mississippi, 379 U.S. 443, 451—452, 85 S.Ct. 564, 569, 13 L.Ed.2d 408 (waiver of constitutional rights by counsel despite defendant's ignorance held allowable). No Fifth Amendment precedent is cited for the Court's contrary view. There might of course be reasons apart from Fifth Amendment precedent for requiring warning or any other safeguard on questioning but that is a different matter entirely. See infra, pp. 516—517.\n",

      "A closing word must be said about the Assistance of Counsel Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which is never expressly relied on by the Court but whose judicial precedents turn out to be linchpins of the confession rules announced today. To support its requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver, the Court cites Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461, ante, p. 475; appointment of counsel for the indigent suspect is tied to Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799, and Douglas v. People of State of California, 372 U.S. 353, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811, ante, p. 473; the silent-record doctrine is borrowed from Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70, ante, p. 475, as is the right to an express offer of counsel, ante, p. 471. All these cases imparting glosses to the Sixth Amendment concerned counsel at trial or on appeal. While the Court finds no petinent difference between judicial proceedings and police interrogation, I believe the differences are so vast as to disqualify wholly the Sixth Amendment precedents as suitable analogies in the present cases.10\n",

      "156\n",
      "The only attempt in this Court to carry the right to counsel into the station house occurred in Escobedo, the Court repeating several times that that stage was no less 'critical' than trial itself. See 378 U.S. 485—488, 84 S.Ct. 1762—1763. This is hardly persuasive when we consider that a grand jury inquiry, the filing of a certiorari petition, and certainly the purchase of narcotics by an undercover agent from a prospective defendant may all be equally 'critical' yet provision of counsel and advice on the score have never been thought compelled by the Constitution in such cases. The sound reason why this right is so freely extended for a criminal trial is the severe injustice risked by confronting an untrained defendant with a range of technical points of law, evidence, and tactics familiar to the prosecutor but not to himself. This danger shrinks markedly in the police station where indeed the lawyer in fulfilling his professional responsibilities of necessity may become an obstacle to truthfinding. See infra, n. 12. The Court's summary citation of the Sixth Amendment cases here seems to me best described as 'the domino method of constitutional adjudication * * * wherein every explanatory statement in a previous opinion is made the basis for extension to a wholly different situation.'

      "Examined as an expression of public policy, the Court's new regime proves so dubious that there can be no due compensation for its weakness in constitutional law. The foregoing discussion has shown, I think, how mistaken is the Court in implying that the Constitution has struck the balance in favor of the approach the Court takes. Ante, p. 479. Rather, precedent reveals that the Fourteenth Amendment in practice has been construed to strike a different balance, that the Fifth Amendment gives the Court little solid support in this context, and that the Sixth Amendment should have no bearing at all. Legal history has been stretched before to satisfy deep needs of society. In this instance, however, the Court has not and cannot make the powerful showing that its new rules are plainly desirable in the context of our society, something which is surely demanded before those rules are engrafted onto the Constitution and imposed on every State and county in the land.\n",

      "\n",
      "159\n",
      "Without at all subscribing to the generally black picture of police conduct painted by the Court, I think it must be frankly recognized at the outset that police questioning allowable under due process precedents may inherently entail some pressure on the suspect and may seek advantage in his ignorance or weaknesses. The atmosphere and questioning techniques, proper and fair though they be, can in themselves exert a tug on the suspect to confess, and in this light '(t)o speak of any confessions of crime made after arrest as being 'voluntary' or 'uncoerced' is somewhat inaccurate, although traditional. A confession is wholly and incontestably voluntary only if a guilty person gives himself up to the law and becomes his own accuser.' Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 161, 64 S.Ct. 921, 929, 88 L.Ed. 1192 (Jackson, J., dissenting). Until today, the role of the Constitution has been only to sift out undue pressure, not to assure spontaneous confessions.11\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "160\n",
      "The Court's new rules aim to offset these minor pressures and disadvantages intrinsic to any kind of police interrogation. The rules do not serve due process interests in preventing blatant coercion since, as I noted earlier, they do nothing to contain the policeman who is prepared to lie from the start. The rules work for reliability in confessions almost only in the Pickwickian sense that they can prevent some from being given at all.12 In short, the benefit of this new regime is simply to lessen or wipe out the inherent compulsion and inequalities to which the Court devotes some nine pages of description. Ante, pp. 448—456.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "161\n",
      "What the Court largely ignores is that its rules impair, if they will not eventually serve wholly to frustrate, an instrument of law enforcement that has long and quite reasonably been thought worth the price paid for it.13 There can be little doubt that the Court's new code would markedly decrease the number of confessions. To warn the suspect that he may remain silent and remind him that his confession may be used in court are minor obstructions. To require also an express waiver by the suspect and an end to questioning whenever he demurs must heavily handicap questioning. And to suggest or provide counsel for the suspect simply invites the end of the interrogation. See, supra, n. 12.\n",

      "How much harm this decision will inflict on law enforcement cannot fairly be predicted with accuracy. Evidence on the role of confessions is notoriously incomplete, see Developments, supra, n. 2, at 941—944, and little is added by the Court's reference to the FBI experience and the resources believed wasted in interrogation. See infra, n. 19, and text. We do know that some crimes cannot be solved without confessions, that ample expert testimony attests to their importance in crime control,14 and that the Court is taking a real risk with society's welfare in imposing its new regime on the country. The social costs of crime are too great to call the new rules anything but a hazardous experimentation.\n",

      "While passing over the costs and risks of its experiment, the Court portrays the evils of normal police questioning in terms which I think are exaggerated. Albeit stringently confined by the due process standards interrogation is no doubt often inconvenient and unpleasant for the suspect. However, it is no less so for a man to be arrested and jailed, to have his house searched, or to stand trial in court, yet all this may properly happen to the most innocent given probable cause, a warrant, or an indictment. Society has always paid a stiff price for law and order, and peaceful interrogation is not one of the dark moments of the law.\n",

However, it may make the analysis more graphic to consider the actual facts of one of the four cases reversed by the Court. Miranda v.

      "On March 3, 1963, an 18-year-old girl was kidnapped and forcibly raped near Phoenix, Arizona. Ten days later, on the morning of March 13, petitioner Miranda was arrested and taken to the police station. At this time Miranda was 23 years old, indigent, and educated to the extent of completing half the ninth grade. He had 'an emotional illness' of the schizophrenic type, according to the doctor who eventually examined him; the doctor's report also stated that Miranda was 'alert and oriented as to time, place, and person,' intelligent within normal limits, competent to stand trial, and sane within the legal definitoin. At the police station, the victim picked Miranda out of a lineup, and two officers then took him into a separate room to interrogate him, starting about 11:30 a.m. Though at first denying his guilt, within a short time Miranda gave a detailed oral confession and then wrote out in his own hand and signed a brief statement admitting and describing the crime. All this was accomplished in two hours or less without any force, threats or promises and—I will assume this though the record is uncertain, ante, 491—492 and nn. 66—67—without any effective warnings at all.\n",

      "Miranda's oral and written confessions are now held inadmissible under the Court's new rules. One is entitled to feel astonished that the Constitution can be read to produce this result. These confessions were obtained during brief, daytime questioning conducted by two officers and unmarked by any of the traditional indicia of coercion. They assured a conviction for a brutal and unsettling crime, for which the police had and quite possibly could obtain little evidence other than the victim's identifications, evidence which is frequently unreliable. There was, in sum, a legitimate purpose, no perceptible unfairness, and certainly little risk of injustice in the interrogation. Yet the resulting confessions, and the responsible course of police practice they represent, are to be sacrificed to the Court's own finespun conception of fairness which I seriously doubt is shared by many thinking citizens in this country.16\n",

Although Escobedo has widely been interpreted as an open invitation to lower courts to rewrite the law of confessions, a significant heavy majority of the state and federal decisions in point have sought quite narrow interpretations.17 Of the courts that have accepted the invitation, it is hard to know how many have felt compelled by their best guess as to this Court's likely construction; but none of the state decisions saw fit to rely on the state privilege against self-incrimination, and no decision at all has gone as far as this Court goes today.18\n",

      "It is also instructive to compare the attitude in this case of those responsible for law enforcement with the official views that existed when the Court undertook three major revisions of prosecutorial practice prior to this case, Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461; Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, and Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799. In Johnson, which established that appointed counsel must be offered the indigent in federal criminal trials, the Federal Government all but conceded the basic issue, which had in fact been recently fixed as Department of Justice policy. See Beaney, Right to Counsel 29—30, 36—42 (1955). In Mapp, which imposed the exclusionary rule on the States for Fourth Amendment violations, more than half of the States had themselves already adopted some such rule. See 367 U.S., at 651, 81 S.Ct., at 1689. In Gideon, which extended Johnson v. Zerbst to the States, an amicus brief was filed by 22 States and Commonwealths urging that course; only two States besides that of the respondent came forward to protest. See 372 U.S., at 345, 83 S.Ct., at 797. By contrast, in this case new restrictions on police questioning have been opposed by the United States and in an amicus brief signed by 27 States and Commonwealths, not including the three other States which are parties. No State in the country has urged this Court to impose the newly announced rules, nor has any State chosen to go nearly so far on its own.\n",

      "The Court in closing its general discussion invokes the practice in federal and foreign jurisdictions as lending weight to its new curbs on confessions for all the States. A brief re sume will suffice to show that none of these jurisdictions has struck so one-sided a balance as the Court does today. Heaviest reliance is placed on the FBI practice. Differing circumstances may make this comparison quite untrustworthy,19 but in any event the FBI falls sensibly short of the Court's formalistic rules. For example, there is no indication that FBI agents must obtain an affirmative 'waiver' before they pursue their questioning. Nor is it clear that one invoking his right to silence may not be prevailed upon to change his mind. And the warning as to appointed counsel apparently indicates only that one will be assigned by the judge when the suspect appears before him; the thrust of the Court's rules is to induce the suspect to obtain appointed counsel before continuing the interview. See ante, pp. 484—486. Apparently American military practice, briefly mentioned by the Court, has these same limits and is still less favorable to the suspect than the FBI warning, making no mention of appointed counsel.

Concededly, the English experience is most relevant. In that country, a caution as to silence but not counsel has long been mandated by the 'Judges' Rules,' which also place other somewhat imprecise limits on police cross-examination o suspects. However, in the courts discretion confessions can be and apparently quite frequently are admitted in evidence despite disregard of the Judges' Rules, so long as they are found voluntary under the common-law test. Moreover, the check that exists on the use of pretrial statements is counterbalanced by the evident admissibility of fruits of an illegal confession and by the judge's often-used authority to comment adversely on the defendant's failure to testify.20\n",

      "India, Ceylon and Scotland are the other examples chosen by the Court. In India and Ceylon the general ban on police-adduced confessions cited by the Court is subject to a major exception: if evidence is uncovered by police questioning, it is fully admissible at trial along with the confession itself, so far as it relates to the evidence and is not blatantly coerced. See Developments, supra, n. 2, at 1106—1110; Reg. v. Ramasamy (1965) A.C. 1 (P.C.). Scotland's limits on interrogation do measure up to the Court's; however, restrained comment at trial on the defendant's failure to take the stand is allowed the judge, and in many other respects Scotch law redresses the prosecutor's disadvantage in ways not permitted in this country.21 The Court ends its survey by imputing added strength to our privilege against self-incrimination since, by contrast to other countries, it is embodied in a written Constitution. Considering the liberties the Court has today taken with constitutional history and precedent, few will find this emphasis persuasive.\n",

Participants in this undertaking include a Special Committee of the American Bar Association, under the chairmanship of Chief Judge Lumbard of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; a distinguished study group of the American Law Institute, headed by Professors Vorenberg and Bator of the Harvard Law School; and the President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, under the leadership of the Attorney General of the United States.22 Studies are also being conducted by the District of Columbia Crime Commission, the Georgetown Law Center, and by others equipped to do practical research.23 There are also signs that legislatures in some of the States may be preparing to re-examine the problem before us.24\n",

Of course legislative reform is rarely speedy or unanimous, though this Court has been more patient in the past.25 But the legislative reforms when they come would have the vast advantage of empirical data and comprehensive study, they would allow experimentation and use of solutions not open to the courts, and they would restore the initiative in criminal law reform to those forums where it truly belongs.\n",

New York (No. 760), the confessions were held admissible and no other errors worth comment are alleged by petitioners. I would affirm in these two cases. The other state case is California v. Stewart (No. 584), where the state supreme court held the confession inadmissible and reversed the conviction. In that case I would dismiss the writ of certiorari on the ground that no final judgment is before us, 28 U.S.C. § 1257 (1964 ed.); putting aside the new trial open to the State in any event, the confession itself has not even been finally excluded since the California Supreme Court left the State free to show proof of a waiver. If the merits of the decision in Stewart be reached, then I believe it should be reversed and the case remanded so the state supreme court may pass on the other claims available to respondent.\n",

      "In the federal case, Westover v. United States (No. 761), a number of issues are raised by petitioner apart from the one already dealt with in this dissent. None of these other claims appears to me tenable, nor in this context to warrant extended discussion. It is urged that the confession was also inadmissible because not voluntary even measured by due process standards and because federal-state cooperation brought the McNabb-Mallory rule into play under Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. 350, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829. However, the facts alleged fall well short of coercion in my view, and I believe the involvement of federal agents in pettioner's arrest and detention by the State too slight to invoke Anderson. I agree with the Government that the admission of the evidence now protested by petitioner was at most harmless error, and two final contentions—one involving weight of the evidence and another improper prosecutor comment—seem to me without merit. I would therefore affirm Westover's conviction.\n",

      "The proposition that the privilege against self-incrimination forbids incustody interrogation without the warnings specified in the majority opinion and without a clear waiver of counsel has no significant support in the history of the privilege or in the language of the Fifth Amendment. As for the English authorities and the common-law history, the privilege, firmly established in the second half of the seventeenth century, was never applied except to prohibit compelled judicial interrogations. The rule excluding coerced confessions matured about 100 years later, '(b)ut there is nothing in the reports to suggest that the theory has its roots in the privilege against self-incrimination. And so far as the cases reveal, the privilege, as such, seems to have been given effect only in judicial proceedings, including the preliminary examinations by authorized magistrates.'

Corwin, The Supreme Court's Construction of the Self-Incrimination Clause, 29 Mich.L.Rev. 1, 2.

Mayers, The Federal Witness' Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: Constitutional or Common-Law? 4 American Journal of Legal History 107 (1960). Such a construction, however, was considerably narrower than the privilege at common law, and when eventually faced with the issues, the Court extended the constitutional privilege to the compulsory production of books and papers, to the ordinary witness before the grand jury and to witnesses generally. Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 6 S.Ct. 524, 29 L.Ed. 746, and Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 12 S.Ct. 195, 35 L.Ed. 1110.

      "A few years later the Fifth Amendment privilege was similarly extended to encompass the then well-established rule against coerced confessions: 'In criminal trials, in the courts of the United States, wherever a question arises whether a confession is incompetent because not voluntary, the issue is controlled by that portion of the fifth amendment to the constitution of the United States, commanding that no person 'shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\" Bram v.

There the defendant had answered questions posed by a Commissioner, who had filed to advise him of his rights, and his answers were held admissible over his claim of involuntariness. 'The fact that (a defendant) is in custody and manacled does not necessarily render his statement involuntary, nor is that necessarily the effect of popular excitement shortly preceding. * * * And it is laid down that it is not essential to the admissibility of a confession that it should appear that the person was warned that what he said would be used against him; but, on the contrary, if the confession was voluntary, it is sufficient, though it appear that he was not so warned.'\n",

And finally, in Cicenia v. La Gay, 357 U.S. 504, 78 S.Ct. 1297, 2 L.Ed.2d 1523, a confession obtained by police interrogation after arrest was held voluntary even though the authorities refused to permit the defendant to consult with his attorney.

It does, however, underscore the obvious—that the Court has not discovered or found the law in making today's decision, nor has it derived it from some irrefutable sources; what it has done is to make new law and new public policy in much the same way that it has in the course of interpreting other great clauses of the Constitution.1 This is what the Court historically has done.

Decisions like these cannot rest alone on syllogism, metaphysics or some ill-defined notions of natural justice, although each will perhaps play its part. In proceeding to such constructions as it now announces, the Court should also duly consider all the factors and interests bearing upon the cases, at least insofar as the relevant materials are available; and if the necessary considerations are not treated in the record or obtainable from some other reliable source, the Court should not proceed to formulate fundamental policies based on speculation alone.\n",

      "First, we may inquire what are the textual and factual bases of this new fundamental rule. To reach the result announced on the grounds it does, the Court must stay within the confines of the Fifth Amendment, which forbids self-incrimination only if compelled. Hence the core of the Court's opinion is that because of the 'compulsion inherent in custodial surroundings, no statement obtained from (a) defendant (in custody) can truly be the product of his free choice,' ante, at 458, absent the use of adequate protective devices as described by the Court. However, the Court does not point to any sudden inrush of new knowledge requiring the rejection of 70 years' experience. Nor does it assert that its novel conclusion reflects a changing consensus among state courts, see Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081, or that a succession of cases had steadily eroded the old rule and proved it unworkable, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799. Rather than asserting new knowledge, the Court concedes that it cannot truly know what occurs during custodial questioning, because of the innate secrecy of such proceedings. It extrapolates a picture of what it conceives to be the norm from police investigatorial manuals, published in 1959 and 1962 or earlier, without any attempt to allow for adjustments in police practices that may have occurred in the wake of more recent decisions of state appellate tribunals or this Court. But even if the relentless application of the described procedures could lead to involuntary confessions, it most assuredly does not follow that each and every case will disclose this kind of interrogation or this kind of consequence.2 Insofar as appears from the Court's opinion, it has not examined a single transcript of any police interrogation, let alone the interrogation that took place in any one of these cases which it decides today. Judged by any of the standards for empirical investigation utilized in the social sciences the factual basis for the Court's premise is patently inadequate.\n",

      "\n",
      "195\n",
      "Although in the Court's view in-custody interrogation is inherently coercive, the Court says that the spontaneous product of the coercion of arrest and detention is still to be deemed voluntary. An accused, arrested on probable cause, may blurt out a confession which will be admissible despite the fact that he is alone and in custody, without any showing that he had any notion of his right to remain silent or of the consequences of his admission. Yet, under the Court's rule, if the police ask him a single question such as 'Do you have anything to say?' or 'Did you kill your wife?' his response, if there is one, has somehow been compelled, even if the accused has been clearly warned of his right to remain silent. Common sense informs us to the contrary. While one may say that the response was 'involuntary' in the sense the question provoked or was the occasion for the response and thus the defendant was induced to speak out when he might have remained silent if not arrested and not questioned, it is patently unsound to say the response is compelled.\n",

      "\n",

      "Today's result would not follow even if it were agreed that to some extent custodial interrogation is inherently coercive. See Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 161, 64 S.Ct. 921, 929, 88 L.Ed. 1192 (Jackson, J., dissenting). The test has been whether the totality of circumstances deprived the defendant of a 'free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer,' Lisenba v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 219, 241, 62 S.Ct. 280, 292, 86 L.Ed. 166, and whether physical or psychological coercion was of such a degree that 'the defendant's will was overborne at the time he confessed,' Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 513, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1343, 10 L.Ed.2d 513; Lynumn v. State of Illinois, 372 U.S. 528, 534, 83 S.Ct. 917, 920, 9 L.Ed.2d 922. The duration and nature of incommunicado custody, the presence or absence of advice concerning the defendant's constitutional rights, and the granting or refusal of requests to communicate with lawyers, relatives or friends have all been rightly regarded as important data bearing on the basic inquiry. See, e.g., Ashcraft v. State of Tennessee, 322 U.S. 143, 64 S.Ct. 921; Haynes v. State of Washington, 373 U.S. 503, 83 S.Ct. 1336.3 But it has never been suggested, until today, that such questioning was so coercive and accused persons so lacking in hardihood that the very first response to the very first question following the commencement of custody must be conclusively presumed to be the product of an overborne will.\n",

      "\n",
      "197\n",
      "If the rule announced today were truly based on a conclusion that all confessions resulting from custodial interrogation are coerced, then it would simply have no rational foundation. Compare Tot v. United States, 319 U.S. 463, 466, 63 S.Ct. 1241, 1244, 87 L.Ed. 1519; United States v. Romano, 382 U.S. 136, 86 S.Ct. 279, 15 L.Ed.2d 210. A fortiori that would be true of the extension of the rule to exculpatory statements, which the Court effects after a brief discussion of why, in the Court's view, they must be deemed incriminatory but without any discussion of why they must be deemed coerced. See Wilson v. United States, 162 U.S. 613, 624, 16 S.Ct. 895, 900, 40 L.Ed. 1090. Even if one were to postulate that the Court's concern is not that all confessions induced by police interrogation are coerced but rather that some such confessions are coerced and present judicial procedures are believed to be inadequate to identify the confessions that are coerced and those that are not, it would still not be essential to impose the rule that the Court has now fashioned. Transcripts or observers could be required, specific time limits, tailored to fit the cause, could be imposed, or other devices could be utilized to reduce the chances that otherwise indiscernible coercion will produce an inadmissible confession.\n",

      "\n",
      "198\n",
      "On the other hand, even if one assumed that there was an adequate factual basis for the conclusion that all confessions obtained during in-custody interrogation are the product of compulsion, the rule propounded by the Court will still be irrational, for, apparently, it is only if the accused is also warned of his right to counsel and waives both that right and the right against self-incrimination that the inherent compulsiveness of interrogation disappears. But if the defendant may not answer without a warning a question such as 'Where were you last night?' without having his answer be a compelled one, how can the Court ever accept his negative answer to the question of whether he wants to consult his retained counsel or counsel whom the court will appoint? And why if counsel is present and the accused nevertheless confesses, or counsel tells the accused to tell the truth, and that is what the accused does, is the situation any less coercive insofar as the accused is concerned? The Court apparently realizes its dilemma of foreclosing questioning without the necessary warnings but at the same time permitting the accused, sitting in the same chair in front of the same policemen, to waive his right to consult an attorney. It expects, however, that the accused will not often waive the right; and if it is claimed that he has, the State faces a severe, if not impossible burden of proof.\n",

      "All of this makes very little sense in terms of the compulsion which the Fifth Amendment proscribes. That amendment deals with compelling the accused himself. It is his free will that is involved. Confessions and incriminating admissions, as such, are not forbidden evidence; only those which are compelled are banned. I doubt that the Court observes these distinctions today. By considering any answers to any interrogation to be compelled regardless of the content and course of examination and by escalating the requirements to prove waiver, the Court not only prevents the use of compelled confessions but for all practical purposes forbids interrogation except in the presence of counsel. That is, instead of confining itself to protection of the right against compelled self-incrimination the Court has created a limited Fifth Amendment right to counsel—or, as the Court expresses it, a 'need for counsel to protect the Fifth Amendment privilege * * *.' Ante, at 470. The focus then is not on the will of the accused but on the will of counsel and how much influence he can have on the accused. Obviously there is no warrant in the Fifth Amendment for thus installing counsel as the arbiter of the privilege.\n",

      "Criticism of the Court's opinion, however, cannot stop with a demonstration that the factual and textual bases for the rule it proponds are, at best, less than compelling. Equally relevant is an assessment of the rule's consequences measured against community values. The Court's duty to assess the consequences of its action is not satisfied by the utterance of the truth that a value of our system of criminal justice is 'to respect the inviolability of the human personality' and to require government to produce the evidence against the accused by its own independent labors. Ante, at 460. More than the human dignity of the accused is involved; the human personality of others in the society must also be preserved. Thus the values reflected by the privilege are not the sole desideratum; society's interest in the general security is of equal weight.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "202\n",
      "The obvious underpinning of the Court's decision is a deep-seated distrust of all confessions. As the Court declares that the accused may not be interrogated without counsel present, absent a waiver of the right to counsel, and as the Court all but admonishes the lawyer to advise the accused to remain silent, the result adds up to a judicial judgment that evidence from the accused should not be used against him in any way, whether compelled or not. This is the not so subtle overtone of the opinion—that it is inherently wrong for the police to gather evidence from the accused himself. And this is precisely the nub of this dissent. I see nothing wrong or immoral, and certainly nothing unconstitutional, in the police's asking a suspect whom they have reasonable cause to arrest whether or not he killed his wife or in confronting him with the evidence on which the arrest was based, at least where he has been plainly advised that he may remain completely silent, see Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 499, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 1769, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (dissenting opinion). Until today, 'the admissions or confessions of the prisoner, when voluntarily and freely made, have always ranked high in the scale of incriminating evidence.' Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 596, 16 S.Ct. 644, 646, 40 L.Ed. 819, see also Hopt v. People of Territory of Utah, 110 U.S. 574, 584—585, 4 S.Ct. 202, 207. Particularly when corroborated, as where the police have confirmed the accused's disclosure of the hiding place of implements or fruits of the crime, such confessions have the highest reliability and significantly contribute to the certitude with which we may believe the accused is guilty. Moreover, it is by no means certain that the process of confessing is injurious to the accused. To the contrary it may provide psychological relief and enhance the prospects for rehabilitation.\n",

      "203\n",
      "This is not to say that the value of respect for the inviolability of the accused's individual personality should be accorded no weight or that all confessions should be indiscriminately admitted. This Court has long read the Constitution to proscribe compelled confessions, a salutary rule from which there should be no retreat. But I see no sound basis, factual or otherwise, and the Court gives none, for concluding that the present rule against the receipt of coerced confessions is inadequate for the task of sorting out inadmissible evidence and must be replaced by the per se rule which is now imposed. Even if the new concept can be said to have advantages of some sort over the present law, they are far outweighed by its likely undesirable impact on other very relevant and important interests.\n",

State of New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 455, 59 S.Ct. 618, 619, 83 L.Ed. 888. These ends of society are served by the criminal laws which for the most part are aimed at the prevention of crime. Without the reasonably effective performance of the task of preventing private violence and retaliation, it is idle to talk about human dignity and civilized values.\n",

      "\n",
      "205\n",
      "The modes by which the criminal laws serve the interest in general security are many. First the murderer who has taken the life of another is removed from the streets, deprived of his liberty and thereby prevented from repeating his offense. In view of the statistics on recidivism in this country4 and of the number of instances in which apprehension occurs only after repeated offenses, no one can sensibly claim that this aspect of the criminal law does not prevent crime or contribute significantly to the personal security of the ordinary citizen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "206\n",
      "Secondly, the swift and sure apprehension of those who refuse to respect the personal security and dignity of their neighbor unquestionably has its impact on others who might be similarly tempted. That the criminal law is wholly or partly ineffective with a segment of the population or with many of those who have been apprehended and convicted is a very faulty basis for concluding that it is not effective with respect to the great bulk of our citizens or for thinking that without the criminal laws, or in the absence of their enforcement, there would be no increase in crime. Arguments of this nature are not borne out by any kind of reliable evidence that I have been to this date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "207\n",
      "Thirdly, the law concerns itself with those whom it has confined. The hope and aim of modern penology, fortunately, is as soon as possible to return the convict to society a better and more law-abiding man than when he left. Sometimes there is success, sometimes failure. But at least the effort is made, and it should be made to the very maximum extent of our present and future capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "208\n",
      "The rule announced today will measurably weaken the ability of the criminal law to perform these tasks. It is a deliberate calculus to prevent interrogations, to reduce the incidence of confessions and pleas of guilty and to increase the number of trials.5 Criminal trials, no matter how efficient the police are, are not sure bets for the prosecution, nor should they be if the evidence is not forthcoming. Under the present law, the prosecution fails to prove its case in about 30% of the criminal cases actually tried in the federal courts. See Federal Offenders: 1964, supra, note 4, at 6 (Table 4), 59 (Table 1); Federal Offenders; 1963, supra, note 4, at 5 (Table 3); District of Columbia Offenders: 1963, supra, note 4, at 2 (Table 1). But it is something else again to remove from the ordinary criminal case all those confessions which heretofore have been held to be free and voluntary acts of the accused and to thus establish a new constitutional barrier to the ascertainment of truth by the judicial process. There is, in my view, every reason to believe that a good many criminal defendants who otherwise would have been convicted on what this Court has previously thought to be the most satisfactory kind of evidence will now under this new version of the Fifth Amendment, either not be tried at all or will be acquitted if the State's evidence, minus the confession, is put to the test of litigation.\n",

      "In some unknown number of cases the Court's rule will return a killer, a rapist or other criminal to the streets and to the environment which produced him, to repeat his crime whenever it pleases him. As a consequence, there will not be a gain, but a loss, in human dignity. The real concern is not the unfortunate consequences of this new decision on the criminal law as an abstract, disembodied series of authoritative proscriptions, but the impact on those who rely on the public authority for protection and who without it can only engage in violent self-help with guns, knives and the help of their neighbors similarly inclined. There is, of course, a saving factor: the next victims are uncertain, unnamed and unrepresented in this case.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "211\n",
      "Nor can this decision do other than have a corrosive effect on the criminal laws as an effective device to prevent crime. A major component in its effectiveness in this regard is its swift and sure enforcement. The easier it is to get away with rape and murder, the less the deterrent effect on those who are inclined to attempt it. This is still good common sense. If it were not, we should posthaste liquidate the whole law enforcement establishment as a useless, misguided effort to control human conduct.\n",

      "\n",
      "212\n",
      "And what about the accused who has confessed or would confess in response to simple, noncoercive questioning and whose guilt could not otherwise be proved? Is it so clear that release is the best thing for him in every case? Has it so unquestionably been resolved that in each and every case it would be better for him not to confess and to return to his environment with no attempt whatsoever to help him? I think not. It may well be that in many cases it will be no less than a callous disregard for his own welfare as well as for the interests of his next victim.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "213\n",
      "There is another aspect to the effect of the Court's rule on the person whom the police have arrested on probable cause. The fact is that he may not be guilty at all and may be able to extricate himself quickly and simply if he were told the circumstances of his arrest and were asked to explain. This effort, and his release, must now await the hiring of a lawyer or his appointment by the court, consultation with counsel and then a session with the police or the prosecutor. Similarly, where probable cause exists to arrest several suspects, as where the body of the victim is discovered in a house having several residents, compare Johnson v. State, 238 Md. 140, 207 A.2d 643 (1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 1013, 86 S.Ct. 623, 15 L.Ed.2d 528, it will often be true that a suspect may be cleared only through the results of interrogation of other suspects. Here too the release of the innocent may be delayed by the Court's rule.\n",

      "\n",
      "214\n",
      "Much of the trouble with the Court's new rule is that it will operate indiscriminately in all criminal cases, regardless of the severity of the crime or the circumstances involved. It applies to every defendant, whether the professional criminal or one committing a crime of momentary passion who is not part and parcel of organized crime. It will slow down the investigation and the apprehension of confederates in those cases where time is of the essence, such as kidnapping, see Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 183, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 1314, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (Jackson, J., dissenting); People v. Modesto, 62 Cal.2d 436, 446, 42 Cal.Rptr. 417, 423, 398 P.2d 753, 759 (1965), those involving the national security, see United States v. Drummond, 354 F.2d 132, 147 (C.A.2d Cir. 1965) (en banc) (espionage case), pet. for cert. pending, No. 1203, Misc., O.T. 1965; cf. Gessner v. United States, 354 F.2d 726, 730, n. 10 (C.A.10th Cir. 1965) (upholding, in espionage case, trial ruling that Government need not submit classified portions of interrogation transcript), and some of those involving organized crime. In the latter context the lawyer who arrives may also be the lawyer for the defendant's colleagues and can be relied upon to insure that no breach of the organization's security takes place even though the accused may feel that the best thing he can do is to cooperate.\n",

      "At the same time, the Court's per se approach may not be justified on the ground that it provides a 'bright line' permitting the authorities to judge in advance whether interrogation may safely be pursued without jeopardizing the admissibility of any information obtained as a consequence. Nor can it be claimed that judicial time and effort, assuming that is a relevant consideration, will be conserved because of the ease of application of the new rule. Today's decision leaves open such questions as whether the accused was in custody, whether his statements were spontaneous or the product of interrogation, whether the accused has effectively waived his rights, and whether nontestimonial evidence introduced at trial is the fruit of statements made during a prohibited interrogation, all of which are certain to prove productive of uncertainty during investigation and litigation during prosecution. For all these reasons, if further restrictions on police interrogation are desirable at this time, a more flexible approach makes much more sense than the Court's constitutional straitjacket which forecloses more discriminating treatment by legislative or rule-making pronouncements.\n",

Parker, 40 L.A.Bar Bull. 603, 607, 642 (1965).

      " The decisions of this Court have guaranteed the same procedural protection for the defendant whether his confession was used in a federal or state court. It is now axiomatic that the defendant's constitutional rights have been violated if his conviction is based, in whole or in part, on an involuntary confession, regardless of its truth or falsity. Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 544, 81 S.Ct. 735, 741, 5 L.Ed.2d 760 (1961); Siang Sung Wan v. United States, 266 U.S. 1, 45 S.Ct. 1, 69 L.Ed. 131 (1924).

Denno, 378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 904 (1964); United States v. Carignan, 342 U.S. 36, 38, 72 S.Ct. 97, 98, 96 L.Ed. 48 (1951); see also Wilson v.

      " The Court points to England, Scotland, Ceylon and India as having equally rigid rules. As my Brother Harlan points out, post, pp. 521—523, the Court is mistaken in this regard, for it overlooks counterbalancing prosecutorial advantages. Moreover, the requirements of the Federal Bureau of Investigation do not appear from the Solicitor General's latter, ante, pp. 484—486, to be as strict as those imposed today in at least two respects: (1) The offer of counsel is articulated only as 'a right to counsel'; nothing is said about a right to have counsel present at the custodial interrogation. (See also the examples cited by the Solicitor General, Westover v. United States, 342 F.2d 684, 685 (9 Cir., 1965) ('right to consult counsel'); Jackson v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C. 100, 337 F.2d 136, 138 (1964) (accused 'entitled to an attorney').) Indeed, the practice is that whenever the suspect 'decides that he wishes to consult with counsel before making a statement, the interview is terminated at that point. * * * When counsel appears in person, he is permitted to confer with his client in private.' This clearly indicates that the FBI does not warn that counsel may be present during custodial interrogation. (2) The Solicitor General's letter states: '(T)hose who have been arrested for an offense under FBI jurisdiction, or whose arrest is contemplated following the interview, (are advised) of a right to free counsel if they are unable to pay, and the availability of such counsel from the Judge.' So phrased, this warning does not indicate that the agent will secure counsel. Rather, the statement may well be interpreted by the suspect to mean that the burden is placed upon himself and that he may have counsel appointed only when brought before the judge or at trial but not at custodial interrogation. As I view the FBI practice, it is not as broad as the one laid down today by the Court.\n",

The narrow question is whether the respondent Noia may be granted federal habeas corpus relief from imprisonment under a New York conviction now admitted by the State to rest upon a confession obtained from him in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, after he was denied state post-conviction relief because the coerced confession claim had been decided against him at the trial and Noia had allowed the time for a direct appeal to lapse without seeking review by a state appellate court.\n",

      "Noia was convicted in 1942 with Santo Caminito and Frank Bonino in the County Court of Kings County, New York, of a felony murder in the shooting and killing of one Hammeroff during the commission of a robbery. The sole evidence against each defendant was his signed confession. Caminito and Bonino, but not Noia, appealed their convictions to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. These appeals were unsuccessful, but subsequent legal proceedings resulted in the releases of Caminito and Bonino on findings that their confessions had been coerced and their convictions therefore procured in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.1 Although it has been stipulated that the coercive nature of Noia's confession was also established,2 the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York held in Noia's federal habeas corpus proceeding that because of his failure to appeal he must be denied relief under the provision of 28 U.S.C. § 2254 whereby 'An application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it appears that the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State * * *.' 183 F.Supp. 222 (1960).3 The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, one judge dissenting, and ordered that Noia's conviction be set aside and that he be discharged from custody unless given a new trial forthwith. 300 F.2d 345 (1962). The Court of Appeals questioned whether § 2254 barred relief on federal habeas corpus where the applicant had failed to exhaust state remedies no longer available to him at the time the habeas proceeding was commenced (here a direct appeal from the conviction), but held that in any event exceptional circumstances were present which excused compliance with the section. The court also rejected other arguments advanced in support of the proposition that the federal remedy was unavailable to Noia. The first was that the denial of state post-conviction coram nobis relief on the ground of Noia's failure to appeal barred habeas relief because such failure constituted an adequate and independent state ground of decision, such that this Court on direct review of the state coram nobis proceedings would have declined to adjudicate the federal questions presented. In rejecting this argument, the court—while expressing the view that '(j)ust as it would be an encroachment on the prerogatives of the state for the Supreme Court upon direct review to disregard the state ground, equally—if not more so—would it be a trespass against the state for a lower federal court, upon a petition for habeas corpus, to disregard the state ground in granting relief to the prisoner,' 300 F.2d at 359—held that the exceptional circumstances excusing compliance with § 2254 also established that Noia's failure to appeal was not a state procedural ground adequate to bar the federal habeas remedy: 'The coincidence of these factors: the undisputed violation of a significant constitutional right, the knowledge of this violation brought home to the federal court at the incipiency of the habeas corpus proceeding so forcibly that the state made no effort to contradict it, and the freedom the relator's codefendants now have by virtue of their vindications of the identical constitutional right leads us to conclude that the state procedural ground, that of a simple failure to appeal, reasonable enough to prevent federal judicial intervention in most cases, is in this particular case unreasonable and inadequate.' 300 F.2d, at 362. The second argument was that Noia's failure to appeal was to be deemed a waiver of his claim that he had been unconstitutionally convicted. The Court of Appeals rejected this argument on the ground that no waiver could be inferred in the circumstances. Id., at 351—352.\n",

      "We granted certiorari. 369 U.S. 869, 82 S.Ct. 1140, 8 L.Ed.2d 274. We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals but reach that court's result by a different course of reasoning. We hold: (1) Federal courts have power under the federal habeas statute to grant relief despite the applicant's failure to have pursued a state remedy not available to him at the time he applies; the doctrine under which state procedural defaults are held to constitute an adequate and independent state law ground barring direct Supreme Court review is not to be extended to limit the power granted the federal courts under the federal habeas statute. (2) Noia's failure to appeal was not a failure to exhaust 'the remedies available in the courts of the State' as required by § 2254; that requirement refers only to a failure to exhaust state remedies still open to the applicant at the time he files his application for habeas corpus in the federal court. (3) Noia's failure to appeal cannot under the circumstances be deemed an intelligent and understanding waiver of his right to appeal such as to justify the withholding of federal habeas corpus relief.\n",

It is 'a writ antecedent to statute, and throwing its root deep into the genius of our common law * * *. It is perhaps the most important writ known to the constitutional law of England, affording as it does a swift and imperative remedy in all cases of illegal restraint or confinement. It is of immemorial antiquity, an instance of its use occurring in the thirty-third year of Edward I.' Secretary of State for Home Affairs v. O'Brien, (1923) A.C. 603, 609 (H.L.).

      "These are not extravagant expressions. Behind them may be discerned the unceasing contest between personal liberty and government oppression. It is no accident that habeas corpus has time and again played a central role in national crises, wherein the claims of order and of liberty clash most acutely, not only in England in the seventeenth century,8 but also in America from our very beginnings, and today.9 Although in form the Great Writ is simply a mode of procedure, its history is inextricably intertwined with the growth of fundamental rights of personal liberty. For its function has been to provide a prompt and efficacious remedy for whatever society deems to be intolerable restraints. Its root principle is that in a civilized society, government must always be accountable to the judiciary for a man's imprisonment: if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with the fundamental requirements of law, the individual is entitled to his immediate release. Thus there is nothing novel in the fact that today habeas corpus in the federal courts provides a mode for the redress of denials of due process of law. Vindication of due process is precisely its historic office. In 1593, for example, a bill was introduced in the House of Commons, which, after deploring the frequency of violations of 'the great Charter and auncient good Lawes and statutes of this realme,' provided:\n",

      "Of course standards of due process have evolved over the centuries. But the nature and purpose of habeas corpus have remained remarkably constant. History refutes the notion that until recently the writ was available only in a very narrow class of lawless imprisonments. For example, it is not true that at common law habeas corpus was exclusively designed as a remedy for executive detentions; it was early used by the great common-law courts to effect the release of persons detained by order of inferior courts.11 The principle that judicial as well as executive restraints may be intolerable received dramatic expression in Bushell's case, Vaughan, 135, 124 Eng.Rep. 1006, 6 Howell's State Trials 999 (1670). Bushell was one of the jurors in the trial, held before the Court of Oyer and Terminer at the Old Bailey, of William Penn and William Mead on charges of tumultuous assembly and other crimes. When the jury brought in a verdict of not guilty, the court ordered the jurors committed for contempt. Bushell sought habeas corpus, and the Court of Common Pleas, in a memorable opinion by Chief Justice Vaughan, ordered him discharged from custody. The case is by no means isolated,12 and when hebeas corpus practice was codified in the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679, 31 Car. II, c. 2, no distinction was made between executive and judicial detentions.13\n",

      "Nor is it true that at common law habeas corpus was available only to inquire into the jurisdiction, in a narrow sense, of the committing court. Bushell's case is again in point. Chief Justice Vaughan did not base his decision on the theory that the Court of Oyer and Terminer had no jurisdiction to commit persons for contempt, but on the plain denial of due process, violative of Magna Charta, of a court's imprisoning the jury because it disagreed with the verdict:\n",

      "Thus, at the time that the Suspension Clause was written into our Federal Constitution and the first Judiciary Act was passed conferring habeas corpus jurisdiction upon the federal judiciary, there was respectable common-law authority for the proposition that habeas was available to remedy any kind of governmental restraint contrary to fundamental law. In this connection it is significant that neither the Constitution nor the Judiciary Act anywhere defines the writ, although the Act does intimate, 1 Stat. 82, that its issuance is to be 'agreeable to the principles and usages of law;—the common law, presumably. We need not pause to consider whether it was the Framers' understanding that congressional refusal to permit the federal courts to accord the writ its full common-law scope as we have described it might constitute an unconstitutional suspension of the privilege of the writ. There have been some intimations of support for such a proposition in decisions of this Court. Thus Mr. Justice (later Chief Justice) Stone wrote for the Court that '(t)he use of the writ * * * as an incident of the federal judicial power is implicitly recognized by Article I, § 9, Cl. 2, of the Constitution.' McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 135, 55 S.Ct. 24, 26, 79 L.Ed. 238. (Italics supplied.) To the same effect are the words of Chief Justice Chase in Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 95, 19 L.Ed. 332: 'The terms of this provision (the Suspension Clause) necessarily imply judicial action.' And see United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U.S. 279, 295, 24 S.Ct. 719, 724, 48 L.Ed. 979 (concurring opinion).15 But at all events it would appear that the Constitution invites, if it does not compel, cf. Byrd v. Blue Ridge Rural Elec. Cooperative, 356 U.S. 525, 537, 78 S.Ct. 893, 900, 2 L.Ed.2d 953, a generous construction of the power of the federal courts to dispense the writ conformably with common-law practice.\n",

      "The early decision of this Court in Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 7 L.Ed. 650, which held that the judgment of a federal court of competent jurisdiction could not be impeached on habeas, seems to have viewed the power more narrowly; see also Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38, 5 L.Ed. 391. But Watkins may have been compelled by factors, affecting peculiarly the jurisdiction of this Court, which are not generally applicable to federal habeas corpus powers. It was plain from the decision in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 174—175, 2 L.Ed. 60, which had narrowly construed the grant of original jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in Article III, that the Court would have the power to issue writs of habeas corpus only if such issuance could be deemed an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. Confronted with the question in Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch 75, 2 L.Ed. 554—like Watkins, a case of direct application to the Court for the writ—the Court held that the jurisdiction 'which the court is now asked to exercise is clearly appellate. It is the revision of a decision of an inferior court, by which a citizen has been committed to gaol.' 4 Cranch, at 100. This answer sufficed to enable the discharge of the petitioners, who had been committed (but not tried or convicted) for treason; but at the same time it virtually dictated the result in Watkins. The Court had no general jurisdiction of appeals from federal criminal judgments, see pp. 834—835, infra; if, therefore, the writ of habeas corpus was appellate in nature, its issuance to vacate such a judgment would have the effect of accomplishing indirectly what the Court had no power to do directly. This reasoning is prominent in Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court in Watkins. See 3 Pet. at 203.\n",

      "Strictly, then, Watkins is authority only as to this Court's power to issue the writ; the habeas jurisdiction of the other federal courts and judges, including the individual Justices of the Supreme Court, has generally been deemed original. In re Kaine, 14 How. 103, 14 L.Ed. 345; Ex parte Yerger, 8 Wall. 85, 101, 19 L.Ed. 332. But cf. Ex parte Clarke, 100 U.S. 399, 25 L.Ed. 715. But even as to this Court's power, the life of the principles advanced in Watkins was relatively brief.16 In Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872, again a case of direct application to this Court for the writ, the Court ordered the release of one duly convicted in a Federal Circuit Court. The trial judge, after initially imposing upon the defendant a sentence in excess of the legal maximum, had attempted to correct the error by resentencing him. The Court held this double-sentencing procedure unconstitutional, on the ground of double jeopardy, and while conceding that the Circuit Court had a general competence in criminal cases, reasoned that it had no jurisdiction to render a patently lawless judgment.\n",

A conviction under it is not  merely erroneous, but is illegal and void, and cannot be a  legal cause of imprisonment. It is true, if no writ of error  lies, the judgment may be final, in the sense that there may be no means of reversing it.

      "The same principles have consistently been applied in cases of state prisoners seeking habeas corpus in the federal courts, although the development of the law in this area was at first delayed for several reasons. The first Judiciary Act did not extend federal habeas to prisoners in state custody, Ex parte Dorr, 3 How. 103, 11 L.Ed. 514; and shortly after Congress removed this limitation in 1867, it withdrew from this Court jurisdiction of appeals from habeas decisions by the lower federal courts and did not restore it for almost 20 years.18 Moreover, it was not until this century that the Fourteenth Amendment was deemed to apply some of the safeguards of criminal procedure contained in the Bill of Rights to the States. Yet during the period of the withdrawal of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction of habeas appeals, the lower federal courts did not hesitate to discharge state prisoners whose convictions rested on unconstitutional statutes or had otherwise been obtained in derogation of constitutional rights.19 After its jurisdiction had been restored, this Court adhered to the pattern set by the lower federal courts and to the principles enunciated in Ex parte Siebold and the other federal-prisoner cases.20 More recently, further applications of the Fourteenth Amendment in state criminal proceedings have led the Court to find correspondingly more numerous occasions upon which federal habeas would lie.21\n",

In such a case, the Federal court has  jurisdiction to issue the writ. The fact that the state court  still has its general jurisdiction and is otherwise a  competent court does not make it impossible to find that a  jury has been subjected to intimidation in a particular case.

      "We do not suggest that this Court has always followed an unwavering line in its conclusions as to the availability of the Great Writ. Our development of the law of federal habeas corpus has been attended, seemingly, with some backing and filling. E.g., Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. 18, 23 L.Ed. 787; Ex parte Bigelow, 113 U.S. 328, 5 S.Ct. 542, 28 L.Ed. 1005; In re Belt, 159 U.S. 95, 15 S.Ct. 987, 40 L.Ed. 88; In re Moran, 203 U.S. 96, 27 S.Ct. 25, 51 L.Ed. 105; Knewel v. Egan, 268 U.S. 442, 45 S.Ct. 522, 69 L.Ed. 1036. Although the remedy extends to federal prisoners held in violation of federal law and not merely of the Federal Constitution, many cases have denied relief upon allegations merely of error of law and not of a substantial constitutional denial. E.g., Ex parte Parks, supra, 93 U.S. at 20 21; In re Wight, 134 U.S. 136, 148, 10 S.Ct. 487, 490, 33 L.Ed. 865; Harlan v. McGourin, 218 U.S. 442, 448, 31 S.Ct. 44, 47, 54 L.Ed. 1101; Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.S. 304, 67 S.Ct. 313, 91 L.Ed. 308. Such decisions are not however authorities against applications which invoke the historic office of the Great Writ to redress detentions in violation of fundamental law.23\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "In some of the cases the denial of the remedy on jurisdictional grounds seems to have been chosen in preference to decision of the merits of constitutional claims felt to be tenuous. E.g., In re Moran, supra; Knewel v. Egan, supra; Goto v. Lane, 265 U.S. 393, 44 S.Ct. 525, 68 L.Ed. 1070; United States v. Valante, 264 U.S. 563, 44 S.Ct. 411, 68 L.Ed. 850.24 And doubtless a powerful influence against the allowance of the remedy to state prisoners flowed from the availablity of review of state criminal judgments in this Court as of right. See, e.g., Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U.S. 272, 276, 15 S.Ct. 389, 391, 39 L.Ed. 422. Before 1916 review of such judgments was not discretionary by writ of certiorari but of right by writ of error.25 The occasions on which the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus was indispensable were therefore few, since the practice of the Court was to put the habeas corpus applicant to his writ of error. E.g., In re Frederich, 149 U.S. 70, 13 S.Ct. 793, 37 L.Ed. 653; Bergemann v. Backer, 157 U.S. 655, 15 S.Ct. 727, 39 L.Ed. 845. And when the Court had no general appellate jurisdiction of federal criminal judgments, which was the case until 1891,26 the writ was sparingly allowed for the reason stated by Chief Justice Marshall in Ex parte Watkins, supra. Thus, in Bigelow the Court said: 'No appeal or writ of error * * * lies to this court. The act of congress has made the judgment of that court (the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia) conclusive, as it had a right to do, and the defendant, having one review of his trial and judgment, has no special reason to complain.' 113 U.S. at 329, 5 S.Ct. at 543. The same view is apparent in Ex parte Parks, supra, 93 U.S. at 20—21; Ex parte Curtis, 106 U.S. 371, 375, 1 S.Ct. 381, 385, 27 L.Ed. 232. Cf. Harlan v.

      "It now remains to consider this principle in the application to the present case. It was settled in Brown v. Allen, supra, that the use of a coerced confession in a state criminal trial could be challenged in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. Yet actually the principle had been foreshadowed much earlier—indeed, in the very first case in which this Court reversed a state conviction on the ground that coerced confessions had been used in evidence. 'That complaint is * * * of a wrong so fundamental that it made the whole proceeding a mere pretense of a trial and rendered the conviction and sentence wholly void. Moore v. Dempsey * * *. (A)nd the proceeding thus vitiated could be challenged in any appropriate manner.' Brown v. Mississippi, 297 U.S. 278, 286—287, 56 S.Ct. 461, 465, 80 L.Ed. 682. Under the conditions of modern society, Noia's imprisonment, under a conviction procured by a confession held by the Court of Appeals in Caminito v. Murphy to have been coerced, and which the State here concedes was obtained in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, is no less intolerable than was Bushell's under the conditions of a very different society; and habeas corpus is no less the appropriate remedy.\n",

      "We can appraise this argument only in light of the historical accommodation that has been worked out between the state and federal courts respecting the administration of federal habeas corpus. Our starting point is the Judiciary Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385—386, which first extended federal habeas corpus to state prisoners generally, and which survives, except for some changes in wording, in the present statutory codification. The original Act and the current provisions are set out in an Appendix at the end of this opinion, pp. 441—445. Although the Act of 1867, like its English and American predecessors, nowhere defines habeas corpus, its expansive language and imperative tone, viewed against the background of post-Civil War efforts in Congress to deal severely with the States of the former Confederacy, would seem to make inescapable the conclusion that Congress was enlarging the habeas remedy as previously understood, not only in extending its coverage to state prisoners, but also in making its procedures more efficacious. In 1867, Congress was anticipating resistance to its Reconstruction measures and planning the implementation of the post-war constitutional Amendments. Debated and enacted at the very peak of the Radical Republicans' power, see 2 Warren, The Supreme Court in United States History (1928), 455—497, the measure that became the Act of 1867 seems plainly to have been designed to furnish a method additional to and independent of direct Supreme Court review of state court decisions for the vindication of the new constitutional guarantees. Congress seems to have had no thought, thus, that a state prisoner should abide state court determination of his constitutional defense—the necessary predicate of direct review by this Court—before resorting to federal habeas corpus. Rather, a remedy almost in the nature of removal from the state to the federal courts of state prisoners' constitutional contentions seems to have been envisaged. See Ex parte Bridges, Fed.Cas.No.1,862, 2 Woods 428, 432 (Cir.Ct.N.D.Ga.1875); Ex parte McCready, Fed.Cas.No.8732, 1 Hughes 598 (Cir.Ct.E.D.Va.1874). Compare Rev.Stat., 1874, § 641 (providing for removal to Federal Circuit Court 'When any civil suit or criminal prosecution is commenced in any State court, for any cause whatsoever, against any person who is denied or cannot enforce in the judicial tribunals of the State * * * any right secured to him by any law providing for the equal civil rights of citizens of the United States'); Virginia v.

      "The elaborate provisions in the Act for taking testimony and trying the facts anew in habeas hearings27 lend support to this conclusion, as does the legislative history of House bill No. 605, which became, with slight changes, the Act of February 5, 1867. The bill was introduced in response to a resolution of the House on December 19, 1865, asking the Judiciary Committee to determine 'what legislation is necessary to enable the courts of the United States to enforce the freedom of the wives and children of soldiers of the United States * * * and also to enforce the liberty of all persons under the operation of the constitutional amendment abolishing slavery.' Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 87. The terms in which it was described by its proponent, Representative Lawrence of Ohio, leave little doubt of the breadth of its intended scope: 'the effect of * * * (bill No. 605) is to enlarge the privilege of the writ of hobeas (sic) corpus, and make the jurisdiction of the courts and judges of the United States coextensive with all the powers that can be conferred upon them. It is a bill of the largest liberty.' Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 4151 (1866). This Court, shortly after the passage of the Act, described it in equally broad terms: 'This legislation is of the most comprehensive character. It brings within the habeas corpus jurisdiction of every court and of every judge every possible case of privation of liberty contrary to the National Constitution, treaties, or laws. It is impossible to widen this jurisdiction.' Ex parte McCardle, 6 Wall. 318, 325 326, 18 L.Ed. 816.\n",

      "In thus extending the habeas corpus power of the federal courts evidently to what was conceived to be its constitutional limit, the Act of February 5, 1867, clearly enough portended difficult problems concerning the relationship of the state and federal courts in the area of criminal administration. Such problems were not slow to mature. Only eight years after passage of the Act, Mr. Justice Bradley, sitting as Circuit Justice, held that a convicted state prisoner who had not sought any state appellate or collateral remedies could nevertheless win immediate release on federal habeas if he proved the unconstitutionality of his conviction; although the judgment was not final within the state court system, the federal court had the power to inquire into the legality of the prisoner's detention. Ex parte Bridges, supra. Accord, Ex parte McCready, supra. This holding flowed inexorably from the clear congressional policy of affording a federal forum for the determination of the federal claims of state criminal defendants, and it was explicitly approved by the full Court in Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 253, 6 S.Ct. 734, 741, 29 L.Ed. 868, a case in which habeas had been sought in advance of trial. The Court held that even in such a case the federal courts had the power to discharge a state prisoner restrained in violation of the Federal Constitution, see 117 U.S., at 245, 250—251, 6 S.Ct., at 739—740, but that ordinarily the federal court should stay its hand on habeas pending completion of the state court proceedings. This qualification plainly stemmed from considerations of comity rather than power, and envisaged only the postponement, not the relinquishment, of federal habeas corpus jurisdiction, which had attached by reason of the allegedly unconstitutional detention and could not be ousted by what the state court might decide. As well stated in a later case:\n",

The  party charged waives no defect of jurisdiction by submitting  to a trial of his case upon the merits, and we think that  comity demands that the state courts, under whose process he  is held, and which are, equally with the federal courts,  charged with the duty of protecting the accused in the  enjoyment of his constitutional rights, should be appealed to in the first instance. Should  such rights be denied, his remedy in the federal court will  remain unimpaired.'28\n",

      "These decisions fashioned a doctrine of abstention, whereby full play would be allowed the States in the administration of their criminal justice without prejudice to federal rights enwoven in the state proceedings. Thus the Court has frequently held that application for a writ of habeas corpus should have been denied 'without prejudice to a renewal of the same after the accused had availed himself of such remedies as the laws of the state afforded * * *.' Minnesota v. Brundage, 180 U.S. 499, 500—501, 21 S.Ct. 455, 456, 45 L.Ed. 639. See also Ex parte Royall, supra, 117 U.S., at 254, 6 S.Ct., at 741. With refinements, this doctrine requiring the exhaustion of state remedies is now codified in 28 U.S.C. § 2254.29 But its rationale has not changed: 'it would be unseemly in our dual system of government for a federal district court to upset a state court conviction without an opportunity to the state courts to correct a constitutional violation * * *. Solution was found in the doctrine of comity between courts, a doctrine which teaches that one court should defer action on causes properly within its jurisdiction until the courts of another sovereignty with concurrent powers, and already cognizant of the litigation, have had an opportunity to pass upon the matter.' Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 204, 70 S.Ct. 587, 590, 94 L.Ed. 761. The rule of exhaustion 'is not one defining power but one which relates to the appropriate exercise of power.' Bowen v.

      "The reasoning of Ex parte Royall and its progeny suggested that after the state courts had decided the federal question on the merits against the habeas petitioner, he could return to the federal court on habeas and there relitigate the question, else a rule of timing would become a rule circumscribing the power of the federal courts on habeas, in defiance of unmistakable congressional intent. And so this Court has consistently held, save only in Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969. In that case, the State Supreme Court had rejected on the merits petitioner's contention of mob domination at his trial, and this Court held that habeas would not lie because the State had afforded petitioner corrective process. However, the decision seems grounded not in any want of power, for the Court described the federal courts' habeas powers in the broadest terms, 237 U.S. at 330—331, 35 S.Ct., at 588, but rather in a narrow conception of due process in state criminal justice. The Court felt that so long as Frank had had an opportunity to challenge his conviction in some impartial tribunal, such as the State Supreme Court, he had been afforded the process he was constitutionally due.\n",

      "The majority's position in Frank, however, was substantially repudiated in Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543, a case almost identical in all pertinent respects to Frank. Mr. Justice Holmes, writing for the Court in Moore (he had written the dissenting opinion in Frank), said: 'if in fact a trial is dominated by a mob so that there is an actual interference with the course of justice, there is a departure from due process of law; * * * (if) the State Courts failed to correct the wrong, * * * perfection in the machinery for correction * * * can (not) prevent this Court from securing to the petitioners their constitutional rights.' 261 U.S., at 90—91, 43 S.Ct., at 266. It was settled in Moore, restoring what evidently had been the assumption until Frank, see, e.g., Cook v. Hart, 146 U.S. 183, 194—195, 13 S.Ct. 40, 43—44, 36 L.Ed. 934; and cases cited in note 28, supra, that the state courts' view of the merits was not entitled to conclusive weight. We have not deviated from that position.30 Thus, we have left the weight to be given a particular state court adjudication of a federal claim later pressed on habeas substantially in the discretion of the Federal District Court: 'the state adjudication carries the weight that federal practice gives to the conclusion of a court * * * of last resort another jurisdiction on federal constitutional issues. It is not res judicata.' Brown v. Allen, supra, 344 U.S., at 458, 73 S.Ct., at 408 (opinion of Mr. Justice Reed). '* * * (N)o binding weight is to be attached to the State determination. The congressional requirement is greater. The State court cannot have the last say when it, though on fair consideration and what procedurally may be deemed fairness, may have misconceived a federal constitutional right.' 344 U.S., at 508, 73 S.Ct., at 446 (opinion of Mr. Justice Frankfurter). Even if the state court adjudication turns wholly on primary, historical facts, the Federal District Court has a broad power on habeas to hold an evidentiary hearing and determine the facts.31\n",

      "The breadth of the federal courts' power of independent adjudication on habeas corpus stems from the very nature of the writ, and conforms with the classic English practice.32 As put by Mr. Justice Holmes in his dissenting opinion in Frank v. Mangum, supra, 237 U.S., at 348, 35 S.Ct., at 595: 'If the petition discloses facts that amount to a loss of jurisdiction in the trial court, jurisdiction could not be restored by any decision above.' It is of the historical essence of habeas corpus that it lies to test proceedings so fundamentally lawless that imprisonment pursuant to them is not merely erroneous but void. Hence, the familiar principle that res judicata is inapplicable in habeas proceedings, see, e.g., Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 214, 70 S.Ct. 587, 595, 94 L.Ed. 761; Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U.S. 224, 230, 44 S.Ct. 519, 521, 68 L.Ed. 989; Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 334, 35 S.Ct. 582, 589, 59 L.Ed. 969; Church, Habeas Corpus (1884), § 386, is really but an instance of the larger principle that void judgments may be collaterally impeached. Restatement, Judgments (1942), §§ 7, 11; Note, Res Judicata, 65 Harv.L.Rev. 818, 850 (1952). Cf. Windsor v. McVeigh, 93 U.S. 274, 282—283, 23 L.Ed. 914. So also, the traditional characterization of the writ of habeas corpus as an original (save perhaps when issued by this Court33) civil remedy for the enforcement of the right to personal liberty,34 rather than as a stage of the state criminal proceedings or as an appeal therefrom, emphasizes the independence of the federal habeas proceedings from what has gone before. This is not to say that a state criminal judgment resting on a constitutional error is void for all purposes. But conventional notions of finality in criminal litigation cannot be permitted to defeat the manifest federal policy that federal constitutional rights of personal liberty shall not be denied without the fullest opportunity for plenary federal judicial review.\n",

      "Despite the Court's refusal to give binding weight to state court determinations of the merits in habeas, it has not infrequently suggested that where the state court declines to reach the merits because of a procedural default, the federal courts may be foreclosed from granting the relief sought on habeas corpus.35 But the Court's practice in this area has been far from uniform,36 and even greater divergency has characterized the practice of the lower federal courts.37\n",

      "For the present, however, it suffices to note that rarely, if ever, has the Court predicated its deference to state procedural rules on a want of power to entertain a habeas application where a procedural default was committed by the defendant in the state courts. Typically, the Court, like the District Court in the instant case, has approached the problem as an aspect of the rule requiring exhaustion of state remedies, which is not a rule distributing power as between the state and federal courts. See pp. 417—420, supra. That was the approach taken in the Spencer and Daniels decisions, the most emphatic in their statement of deference to state rules of procedure. The same considerations of comity that led the Court to refuse relief to one who had not yet availed himself of his state remedies likewise prompted the refusal of relief to one who had inexcusably failed to tender the federal questions to the state courts. Either situation poses a threat to the orderly administration of criminal justice that ought if possible to be averted. Whether in fact the conduct of a Spencer or a Daniels was inexcusable in this sense is beside the point, as is the arguable illogicality of turning a rule of timing into a doctrine of forfeitures. The point is that the Court, by relying upon a rule of discretion, avowedly flexible, Frisbie v. Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 72 S.Ct. 509, 96 L.Ed. 541, yielding always to 'exceptional circumstances,' Bowen v. Johnston, 306 U.S. 19, 27, 59 S.Ct. 442, 446, 83 L.Ed. 455, has refused to concede jurisdictional significance to the abortive state court proceeding.\n",

      "We have reviewed the development of habeas corpus at some length because the question of the instant case has obvious importance to the proper accommodation of a great constitutional privilege and the requirements of the federal system. Our survey discloses nothing to suggest that the Federal District Court lacked the power to order Noia discharged because of a procedural forfeiture he may have incurred under state law. On the contrary, the nature of the writ at common law, the language and purpose of the Act of February 5, 1867, and the course of decisions in this Court extending over nearly a century are wholly irreconcilable with such a limitation. At the time the privilege of the writ was written into the Federal Constitution it was settled that the writ lay to test any restraint contrary to fundamental law, which in England stemmed ultimately from Magna Charta but in this country was embodied in the written Constitution. Congress in 1867 sought to provide a federal forum for state prisoners having constitutional defenses by extending the habeas corpus powers of the federal courts to their constitutional maximum. Obedient to this purpose, we have consistently held that federal court jurisdiction is conferred by the allegation of an unconstitutional restraint and is not defeated by anything that may occur in the state court proceedings. State procedural rules plainly must yield to this overriding federal policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "43\n",
      "A number of arguments are advanced against this conclusion. One, which concedes the breadth of federal habeas power, is that a state prisoner who forfeits his opportunity to vindicate federal defenses in the state court has been given all the process that is constitutionally due him, and hence is not restrained contrary to the Constitution. But this wholly misconceives the scope of due process of law, which comprehends not only the right to be heard but also a number of explicit procedural rights—for example, the right not to be convicted upon evidence which includes one's coerced confession—drawn from the Bill of Rights. As Mr. Justice Holmes explained in Moore v. Dempsey, see pp. 839—840, supra, a mob-dominated trial is no less a denial of due process because the State Supreme Court believed that the trial was actually a fair one. A fortiori, due process denied in the proceedings leading to conviction is not restored just because the state court declines to adjudicate the claimed denial on the merits.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "44\n",
      "A variant of this argument is that if the state court declines to entertain a federal defense because of a procedural default, then the prisoner's custody is actually due to the default rather than to the underlying constitutional infringement, so that he is not in custody in violation of federal law.38 But this ignores the important difference between rights and particular remedies. Cf. Douglas v. Jeannette, 319 U.S. 157, 63 S.Ct. 877, 87 L.Ed. 1324; Stefanelli v. Minard, 342 U.S. 117, 72 S.Ct. 118, 96 L.Ed. 138; Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.S. 25, 69 S.Ct. 1359, 93 L.Ed. 1782. A defendant by committing a procedural default may be debarred from challenging his conviction in the state courts even on federal constitutional grounds. But a forfeiture of remedies does not legitimize the unconstitutional conduct by which his conviction was procured. Would Noia's failure to appeal have precluded him from bringing an action under the Civil Rights Acts against his inquisitors? The Act of February 5, 1867, like the Civil Rights Acts, was intended to furnish an independent, collateral remedy for certain privations of liberty. The conceptual difficulty of regarding a default as extinguishing the substantive right is increased where, as in Noia's case, the default forecloses extraordinary remedies. In what sense is Noia's custody not in violation of federal law simply because New York will not allow him to challenge it on coram nobis or on delayed appeal? But conceptual problems aside, it should be obvious that to turn the instant case on the meaning of 'custody in violation of the Constitution' is to reason in circles. The very question we face is how completely federal remedies fall with the state remedies; when we have answered this, we shall know in what sense custody may be rendered lawful by a supervening procedural default.\n",

      "It is a familiar principle that this Court will decline to review state court judgments which rest on independent and adequate state grounds, notwithstanding the co-presence of federal grounds. See, e.g., N.A.A.C.P. v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 1488; Fox Film Corp. v. Muller, 296 U.S. 207, 56 S.Ct. 183, 80 L.Ed. 158. Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 85—87, denied this Court power to base the reversal of a state court decision on any error other 'than such as * * * immediately respects * * * questions of validity or construction of the said (Federal) constitution, treaties, statutes, commissions, or authorities in dispute.' The deletion of the express restriction by the Judiciary Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, § 2, 14 Stat. 386—387, did not enlarge this Court's power in that regard. Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 22 L.Ed. 429. Murdock was a case involving state substantive grounds, but the principle is also applicable in cases involving procedural grounds. See, e.g., Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 65 S.Ct. 459, 89 L.Ed. 789; Davis v. Wechsler, 263 U.S. 22, 44 S.Ct. 13, 68 L.Ed. 143; Ward v. Board of County Comm'rs, 253 U.S. 17, 40 S.Ct. 419, 64 L.Ed. 761. Thus, a default such as Noia's, if deemed adequate and independent (a question on which we intimate no view), would cut off review by this Court of the state coram nobis proceeding in which the New York Court of Appeals refused him relief. It is contended that it follows from this that the remedy of federal habeas corpus is likewise cut off.39\n",

      "\n",
      "46\n",
      "The fatal weakness of this contention is its failure to recognize that the adequate state-ground rule is a function of the limitations of appellate review. Most of the opinion in the Murdock case is devoted to demonstrating the Court's lack of jurisdiction on direct review to decide questions of state law in cases also raising federal questions. It followed from this holding that if the state question was dispositive of the case, the Court could not decide the federal question. The federal question was moot; nothing turned on its resolution. And so we have held that the adequate state-ground rule is a consequence of the Court's obligation to refrain from rendering advisory opinions or passing upon moot questions.40\n",

      "47\n",
      "But while our appellate function is concerned only with the judgments or decrees of state courts, the habeas corpus jurisdiction of the lower federal courts is not so confined. The jurisdictional prerequisite is not the judgment of a state court but detention simpliciter. The entire course of decisions in this Court elaborating the rule of exhaustion of state remedies is wholly incompatible with the proposition that a state court judgment is required to confer federal habeas jurisdiction. And the broad power of the federal courts under 28 U.S.C. § 2243 summarily to hear the application and to 'determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require,' is hardly characteristic of an appellate jurisdiction. Habeas lies to enforce the right of personal liberty; when that right is denied and a person confined, the federal court has the power to release him. Indeed, it has no other power; it cannot revise the state court judgment; it can act only on the body of the petitioner.

      "To be sure, this may not be the entire answer to the contention that the adequate state-ground principle should apply to the federal courts on habeas corpus as well as to the Supreme Court on direct review of state judgments. The Murdock decision may be supported not only by the factor of mootness, but in addition by certain characteristics of the federal system. The first question the Court had to decide in Murdock was whether it had the power to review state questions in cases also raising federal questions. It held that it did not, thus affirming the independence of the States in matters within the proper sphere of their lawmaking power from federal judicial interference. For the federal courts to refuse to give effect in habeas proceedings to state procedural defaults might conceivably have some effect upon the States' regulation of their criminal procedures. But the problem is crucially different from that posed in Murdock of the federal courts' deciding questions of substantive state law. In Noia's case the only relevant substantive law is federal—the Fourteenth Amendment. State law appears only in the procedural framework for adjudicating the substantive federal question. The paramount interest is federal. Cf. Dice v. Akron, C. & Y.R. Co., 342 U.S. 359, 72 S.Ct. 312, 96 L.Ed. 398. That is not to say that the States have not a substantial interest in exacting compliance with their procedural rules from criminal defendants asserting federal defenses. Of course orderly criminal procedure is a desideratum, and of course there must be sanctions for the flouting of such procedure. But that state interest 'competes * * * against an ideal * * * (the) ideal of fair procedure.' Schaefer, Federalism and State Criminal Procedure, 70 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 5 (1956). And the only concrete impact the assumption of federal habeas jurisdiction in the face of a procedural default has on the state interest we have described, is that it prevents the State from closing off the convicted defendant's last opportunity to vindicate his constitutional rights, thereby punishing him for his default and deterring others who might commit similar defaults in the future.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "49\n",
      "Surely this state interest in an airtight system of forfeitures is of a different order from that, vindicated in Murdock, in the autonomy of state law within the proper sphere of its substantive regulation. The difference is illustrated in the settled principle that if a prisoner is detained lawfully under one count of the indictment, he cannot challenge the lawfulness of a second count on federal habeas. McNally v. Hill, 293 U.S. 131, 55 S.Ct. 24, 79 L.Ed. 238. For the federal court to order the release of such a prisoner would be to nullify a proceeding—that under the first count—wholly outside the orbit of federal interest. Contrariwise the only count under which Noia was convicted and imprisoned is admitted to be vitiated by force of federal law.\n",

      "Certainly this Court has differentiated the two situations in its application of the adequate state-ground rule. While it has deferred to state substantive grounds so long as they are not patently evasive of or discriminatory against federal rights, it has sometimes refused to defer to state procedural grounds only because they made burdensome the vindication of federal rights.41 That the Court nevertheless ordinarily gives effect to state procedural grounds may be attributed to considerations which are peculiar to the Court's role and function and have no relevance to habeas corpus proceedings in the Federal District Courts: the unfamiliarity of members of this Court with the minutiae of 50 States' procedures; the inappropriateness of crowding our docket with questions turning wholly on particular state procedures; the web of rules and statutes that circumscribes our appellate jurisdiction; and the inherent and historical limitations of such a jurisdiction.\n",

      "A practical appraisal of the state interest here involved plainly does not justify the federal courts' enforcing on habeas corpus a doctrine of forfeitures under the guise of applying the adequate state-ground rule. We fully grant, see p. 438, infra, that the exigencies of federalism warrant a limitation whereby the federal judge has the discretion to deny relief to one who has deliberately sought to subvert or evade the orderly adjudication of his federal defenses in the state courts. Surely no stricter rule is a realistic necessity. A man under conviction for crime has an obvious inducement to do his very best to keep his state remedies open, and not stake his all on the outcome of a federal habeas proceeding which, in many respects, may be less advantageous to him than a state court proceeding. See Rogers v. Richmond, 365 U.S. 534, 547—548, 81 S.Ct. 735, 742—743, 5 L.Ed.2d 760. And if because of inadvertence or neglect he runs afoul of a state procedural requirement, and thereby forfeits his state remedies, appellate and collateral, as well as direct review thereof in this Court, those consequences should be sufficient to vindicate the State's valid interest in orderly procedure. Whatever residum of state interest there may be under such circumstances is manifestly insufficient in the face of the federal policy, drawn from the ancient principles of the writ of habeas corpus, embodied both in the Federal Constitution and in the habeas corpus provisions of the Judicial Code, and consistently upheld by this Court, of affording an effective remedy for restraints contrary to the Constitution. For these several reasons we reject as unsound in principle, as well as not supported by authority, the suggestion that the federal courts are without power to grant haneas relief to an applicant whose federal claims would not be heard on direct review in this Court because of a procedural default furnishing an adequate and independent ground of state decision.\n",

      "What we have said substantially disposes of the further contention that 28 U.S.C. § 2254 embodies a doctrine of forfeitures and cuts off relief when there has been a failure to exhaust state remedies no longer available at the time habeas is sought. This contention is refuted by the language of the statute and by its history.42 It was enacted to codify the judicially evolved rule of exhaustion, particularly as formulated in Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 64 S.Ct. 448, 88 L.Ed. 572. See the review of the legislative history in Darr v. Burford, 339 U.S. 200, 211—213, 70 S.Ct. 587, 593—595, 94 L.Ed. 761. Nothing in the Hawk opinion points to past exhaustion. Very little support can be found in the long course of previous decisions by this Court elaborating the rule of exhaustion for the proposition that it was regarded at the time of the revision of the Judicial Code as jurisdictional rather than merely as a rule ordering the state and federal proceedings so as to eliminate unnecessary federal-state friction. There is thus no warrant for attributing to Congress, in the teeth of the language of § 2254, intent to work a radical innovation in the law of habeas corpus. We hold that § 2254 is limited in its application to failure to exhaust state remedies still open to the habeas applicant at the time he files his application in federal court.43 Parenthetically, we note that our holding in Irvin v. Dowd, 359 U.S. 394, 79 S.Ct. 825, 3 L.Ed.2d 900, is not inconsistent. Our holding there was that since the Indiana Supreme Court, Irvin v. State, 236 Ind. 384, 139 N.E.2d 898, had reached the merits of Irvin's federal claim, the District Court, 153 F.Supp. 531, was not barred by § 2254 from determining the merits of Irvin's constitutional contentions.\n",

      "Noia timely sought and was denied certiorari here from the adverse decision of the New York Court of Appeals on his coram nobis application, and therefore the case does not necessarily draw in question the continued vitality of the holding in Darr v. Burford, supra, that a state prisoner must ordinarily seek certiorari in this Court as a precondition of applying for federal habeas corpus. But what we hold today necessarily overrules Darr v. Burford to the extent it may be thought to have barred a state prisoner from federal habeas relief if he had failed timely to seek certiorari in this Court from an adverse state decision. Furthermore, our decision today affects all procedural hurdles to the achievement of swift and imperative justice on habeas corpus, and because the hurdle erected by Darr v. Buford is unjustifiable under the principles we have expressed, even insofar as it may be deemed merely an aspect of the statutory requirement of present exhaustion, that decision in that respect also is hereby overruled.\n",

      "The soundness of the decision was questioned from the beginning. See Pollock, Certiorari and Habeas Corpus, 42 J. of Crim.L. 356, 357—358, n. 15, 364 (1951). Section 2254 speaks only of 'remedies available in the courts of the State.' Nevertheless, the Court in Darr v. Burford put a gloss upon these words to include petitioning for certiorari in this Court, which is not the court of any State, among the remedies that an applicant must exhaust before proceeding in federal habeas corpus. It is true that before the enactment of § 2254 the Court had spoken of the obligation to seek review in this Court before applying for habeas. E.g., Baker v. Grice, 169 U.S. 284, 18 S.Ct. 323, 42 L.Ed. 748; Markuson v. Boucher, 175 U.S. 184, 20 S.Ct. 76, 44 L.Ed. 124. But that was at the time when review of state criminal judgments in this Court was by writ of error. Review here was thus a stage of the normal appellate process. The writ of certiorari, which today provides the usual mode of invoking this Court's appellate jurisdiction of state criminal judgments, 'is not a matter of right, but of sound judicial discretion, and will be granted only where there are special and important reasons therefor.' Supreme Court Rule 19(1). Review on certiorari therefore does not provide a normal appellate channel in any sense comparable to the writ of error.\n",

But that passing reference cannot be exalted into an attribution to Congress of a design patently belied by the unequivocal statutory language.\n",

      "The rationale of Darr v. Burford emphasized the values of comity between the state and federal courts, and assumed that these values would be realized by requiring a state criminal defendant to afford this Court an opportunity to pass upon state action before he might seek relief in federal habeas corpus. But the expectation has not been realized in experience. On the contrary the requirement of Darr v. Burford has proved only to be an unnecessarily burdensome step in the orderly processing of the federal claims of those convicted of state crimes. The goal of prompt and fair criminal justice has been impeded because in the overwhelming number of cases the applications for certiorari have been denied for failure to meet the standard of Rule 19. And the demands upon our time in the examination and decision of the large volume of petitions which fail to meet that test have unwarrantably taxed the resources of this Court. Indeed, it has happened that counsel on oral argument has confessed that the record was insufficient to justify our consideration of the case but that he had felt compelled to make the futile time-consuming application in order to qualify for proceeding in a Federal District Court on habeas corpus to make a proper record. Bullock v. South Carolina, 365 U.S. 292, 81 S.Ct. 686, 5 L.Ed.2d 570. And so in a number of cases the Court has apparently excused compliance with the requirement. See, e.g., Weston v. Sigler, 361 U.S. 37, 80 S.Ct. 141, 4 L.Ed.2d 111; Bailey v. Arkansas, 358 U.S. 869, 79 S.Ct. 101, 3 L.Ed.2d 101; Poret v. Sigler, 355 U.S. 60, 78 S.Ct. 144, 2 L.Ed.2d 107; Massey v. Moore, 348 U.S. 105, 75 S.Ct. 145, 99 L.Ed. 135. Cf. Thomas v. Arizona, 356 U.S. 390, 392, n. 1, 78 S.Ct. 885, 886, 2 L.Ed.2d 863. The same practice has sometimes been followed in the Federal District Courts. See Reitz, Federal Habeas Corpus: Postconviction Remedy for State Prisoners, 108 U. of PaL.Rev. 461, 499 (1960).\n",

      "Moreover, comity does not demand that such a price in squandered judicial resources be paid; the needs of comity are adequately served in other ways. The requirement that the habeas petitioner exhaust state court remedies available to him when he applies for federal habeas corpus relief gives state courts the opportunity to pass upon and correct errors of federal law in the state prisoner's conviction. And the availability to the States of eventual review on certiorari of such decisions of lower federal courts as may grant relief is always open. Our function of making the ultimate accommodation between state criminal law enforcement and state prisoners' constitutional rights becomes more meaningful when grounded in the full and complete record which the lower federal courts on habeas corpus are in a position to provide.\n",

      "Although we hold that the jurisdiction of the federal courts on habeas corpus is not affected by procedural defaults incurred by the applicant during the state court proceedings, we recognize a limited discretion in the federal judge to deny relief to an applicant under certain circumstances. Discretion is implicit in the statutory command that the judge, after granting the writ and holding a hearing of appropriate scope, 'dispose of the matter as law and justice require,' 28 U.S.C. § 2243; and discretion was the flexible concept employed by the federal courts in developing the exhaustion rule. Furthermore, habeas corpus has traditionally been regarded as governed by equitable principles. United States ex rel. Smith. v. Baldi, 344 U.S. 561, 573, 73 S.Ct. 391, 397, 97 L.Ed. 549 (dissenting opinion). Among them is the principle that a suitor's conduct in relation to the matter at hand may disentitle him to the relief he seeks. Narrowly circumscribed, in conformity to the historical role of the writ of habeas corpus as an effective and imperative remedy for detentions contrary to fundamental law, the principle is unexceptionable. We therefore hold that the federal habeas judge may in his discretion deny relief to an applicant who has deliberately bypassed the orderly procedure of the state courts and in so doing has forfeited his state court remedies.\n",

      "But we wish to make very clear that this grant of discretion is not to be interpreted as a permission to introduce legal fictions into federal habeas corpus. The classic definition of waiver enunciated in Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 1023, 82 L.Ed. 1461—'an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a know right or privilege'—furnishes the controlling standard. If a habeas applicant, after consultation with competent counsel or otherwise, understandingly and knowingly forewent the privilege of seeking to vindicate his federal claims in the state courts, whether for strategic, tactical, or any other reasons that can fairly be described as the deliberate by-passing of state procedures, then it is open to the federal court on habeas to deny him all relief if the state courts refused to entertain his federal claims on the merits—though of course only after the federal court has satisfied itself, by holding a hearing or by some other means, of the facts bearing upon the applicant's default. Cf. Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 291, 68 S.Ct. 1049, 1063, 92 L.Ed. 1356. At all events we wish it clearly understood that the standard here put forth depends on the considered choice of the petitioner.44 Cf. Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 513 517, 82 S.Ct. 884, 888—891, 8 L.Ed.2d 70; Moore v. Michigan, 355 U.S. 155, 162—165, 78 S.Ct. 191, 195—197, 2 L.Ed.2d 167. A choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief. Nor does a state court's finding of waiver bar independent determination of the question by the federal courts on habeas, for waiver affecting federal rights is a federal question. E.g., Rice v. Olson, 324 U.S. 786, 65 S.Ct. 989, 89 L.Ed. 1367.\n",

      "The application of the standard we have adumbrated to the facts of the instant case is not difficult. Under no reasonable view can the State's version of Noia's reason for not appealing support an inference of deliberate by-passing of the state court system. For Noia to have appealed in 1942 would have been to run a substantial risk of electrocution. His was the grisly choice whether to sit content with life imprisonment or to travel the uncertain avenue of appeal which, if successful, might well have led to a retrial and death sentence. See, e.g., Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 58 S.Ct. 149, 82 L.Ed. 288. He declined to play Russian roulette in this fashion. This was a choice by Noia not to appeal, but under the circumstances it cannot realistically be deemed a merely tactical or strategic litigation step, or in any way a deliberate circumvention of state procedures. This is not to say that in every case where a heavier penalty, even the death penalty, is a risk incurred by taking an appeal or otherwise foregoing a procedural right, waiver as we have defined it cannot be found. Each case must stand on its facts. In the instant case, the language of the judge in sentencing Noia, see note 3, supra, made the risk that Noia, if reconvicted, would be sentenced to death, palpable and indeed unusually acute.\n",

      "It should be unnecessary to repeat what so often has been said and what so plainly is the case: that the availability of the Great Writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts for persons in the custody of the States offends no legitimate state interest in the enforcement of criminal justice or procedure. Our decision today swings open no prison gates. Today as always few indeed is the number of state prisoners who eventually win their freedom by means of federal habeas corpus.45 Those few who are ultimately successful are persons whom society has grievously wronged and for whom belated liberation is little enough compensation. Surely no fair-minded person will contend that those who have been deprived of their liberty without due process of law ought nevertheless to languish in prison. Noia, no less than his codefendants Caminito and Bonino, is conceded to have been the victim of unconstitutional state action. Noia's case stands on its own; but surely no just and humane legal system can tolerate a result whereby a Caminito and a Bonino are at liberty because their confessions were found to have been coerced yet a Noia, whose confession was also coerced, remains in jail for life. For such anomalies, such affronts to the conscience of a civilized society, habeas corpus is predestined by its historical role in the struggle for personal liberty to be the ultimate remedy. If the States withhold effective remedy, the federal courts have the power and the duty to provide it. Habeas corpus is one of the precious heritages of Anglo-American civilization. We do no more today than confirm its continuing efficacy.\n",

Beyond question the federal courts until today have had no power to release a prisoner in respondent Noia's predicament, there being no basis for such power in either the Constitution or the statute. But the Court today in releasing Noia makes an 'abrupt break' not only with the Constitution and the statute but also with its past decisions, disrupting the delicate balance of federalism so foremost in the minds of the Founding Fathers and so uniquely important in the field of law enforcement. The short of it is that Noia's incarceration rests entirely on an adequate and independent state ground—namely, that he knowingly failed to perfect any appeal from his conviction of murder. While it may be that the Court's 'decision today swings open no prison gates,' the Court must admit in all candor that it effectively swings closed the doors of justice in the face of the State, since it certainly cannot prove its case 20 years after the fact. In view of this unfortunate turn of events, it appears important that we canvass the consequences of today's action on state law enforcement.\n",

He who must search a haystack for a needle is likely to end up with the attitude that the needle is not worth the search.' Brown v.

But the Constitution comprehends another struggle of equal importance and places upon our shoulders the burden of maintaining it—the struggle for law and order. I regret that the Court does not often recognize that each defeat in that struggle chips away inexorably at the base of that very personal liberty which it seeks to protect.

The importance of this prerogative writ, requiring the body of a person restrained of liberty to be brought before the court so that the lawfulness of the restraint may be determined, was recognized in the Constitution,2 and the first Judiciary Act gave the federal courts authority to issue the writ 'agreeable to the principles and usages of law.'3 Although the wording of earlier statutory provisions has been changed, the basic question before the court to which the writ is addressed has always been the same: in the language of the present statute, on the books since 1867, is the detention complained of 'in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States'?

      "1. Pre-1915 period.—The formative stage of the development of habeas corpus jurisdiction may be said to have ended in 1915, the year in which Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969, was decided. During this period the federal courts, on applications for habeas corpus complaining of detention pursuant to a judgment of conviction and sentence, purported to examine only the jurisdiction of the sentencing tribunal. In the leading case of Ex parte Watkins, 3 Pet. 193, 7 L.Ed. 650, the Court stated:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "93\n",
      "'An imprisonment under a judgment cannot be unlawful, unless  that judgment be an absolute nullity; and it is not a nullity  if the court has general jurisdiction of the subject,  although it should be erroneous.' 3 Pet., at 203.\n",

      "\n",
      "94\n",
      "Many subsequent decisions, dealing with both state and federal prisoners, and involving both original applications to this Court for habeas corpus and review of lower court decisions, reaffirmed the limitation of the writ to consideration of the sentencing court's jurisdiction over the person of the defendant and the subject matter of the suit. E.g., Ex parte Parks, 93 U.S. 18, 23 L.Ed. 787; Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U.S. 272, 15 S.Ct. 389, 39 L.Ed. 422; In re Belt, 159 U.S. 95, 15 S.Ct. 987, 40 L.Ed. 88; In re Moran, 203 U.S. 96, 27 S.Ct. 25, 51 L.Ed. 105.\n",

      "The concept of jurisdiction, however, was subjected to considerable strain during this period, and the strain was not lessened by the fact that until the latter part of the last century, federal criminal convictions were not generally reviewable by the Supreme Court.4 The expansion of the definition of jurisdiction occurred primarily in two classes of cases: (1) those in which the conviction was for violation of an allegedly unconstitutional statute, and (2) those in which the Court viewed the detention as based on some claimed illegality in the sentence imposed, as distinguished from the judgment of conviction. An example of the former is Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717 in which the Court considered on its merits the claim that the acts under which the indictments were found were unconstitutional, reasoning that '(a)n unconstitutional law is void, and is as no law,' and therefore 'if the laws are unconstitutional and void, the Circuit Court acquired no jurisdiction of the causes.' 100 U.S., at 376—377.5 An example of the latter is Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872, in which this Court held that if a valid sentence had been carried out, and if the governing statute permitted only one sentence, the sentencing judge lacked jurisdiction to impose further punishment:\n",

      "It was also during this period that Congress, in 1867, first made habeas corpus available by statute to prisoners held under state authority. Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385. In this 1867 Act the Court now seems to find justification for today's decision, relying on the statement of one of its proponents that the bill was 'coextensive with all the powers that can be conferred' on the courts and judges of the United States. Cong.Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 4151. But neither the statute itself, its legislative history, nor its subsequent interpretation lends any support to the view that habeas corpus jurisdiction since 1867 has been exercisable whether or not the state detention complained of rested on decision of a federal question.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "98\n",
      "First, there is nothing in the language of the Act—which spoke of the availability of the writ to prisoners 'restrained of * * * liberty in violation of the constitution * * *'—to suggest that there was any change in the nature of the writ as applied to one held pursuant to a judgment of conviction. The language was that typically employed in habeas corpus cases, and, as we have seen, it was not believed that a person so held was restrained in violation of law if the sentencing court had personal and subject matter jurisdiction. Rather, the change accomplished by the language of the Act related to the classes of prisoners (in particular, state as well as federal) for whom the writ would be available.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "99\n",
      "Second, what little legislative history there is does not suggest any change in the nature of the writ. The extremely brief debates indicated only a lack of understanding as to what the Act would accomplish, coupled with an effort by the proponents to make it clear that the purpose was to extend the availability of the writ to persons not then covered; there was no indication of any intent to alter its substantive scope.7 Thus, less than 20 years after enactment, a congressional committee could say of the 1867 Act that it was not 'contemplated by its framers or * * * properly * * * construed to authorize the overthrow of the final judgments of the State courts of general jurisdiction, by the inferior Federal judges * * *.'8\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "100\n",
      "Third, cases decided under the Act during this period made it clear that the Court did not regard the Act as changing the character of the writ. In considering the lawfulness of the detention of state prisoners, the Court continued to confine itself to questions it regarded as 'jurisdictional.' See, e.g., In re Rahrer, 140 U.S. 545, 11 S.Ct. 865, 35 L.Ed. 572; Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 19 S.Ct. 119, 43 L.Ed. 399; Pettibone v. Nichols, 203 U.S. 192, 27 S.Ct. 111, 51 L.Ed. 148. And the Court repeatedly held that habeas corpus was not available to a state prisoner to consider errors, even constitutional errors, that did not go to the jurisdiction of the sentencing court. E.g., In re Wood, 140 U.S. 278, 11 S.Ct. 738, 35 L.Ed. 505; Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U.S. 272, 15 S.Ct. 389, 39 L.Ed. 422; Bergemann v. Backer, 157 U.S. 655, 15 S.Ct. 727, 39 L.Ed. 845.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "101\n",
      "At the same time, in dealing with applications by state prisoners the Court developed the doctrine of exhaustion of state remedies, a doctrine now embodied in 28 U.S.C. § 2254. In Ex parte Royall, 117 U.S. 241, 6 S.Ct. 734, 29 L.Ed. 868, the prisoner had brought federal habeas corpus seeking release from his detention pending a state prosecution, and alleging that the statute under which he was to be tried was void under the Contract Clause. The power of the federal court to act in this case, if the allegations could be established, was clear since under accepted principles the State would have lacked 'jurisdiction' to detain the prisoner. But the Court observed that the question of constitutionality would be open to the prisoner at his state trial and, absent any showing of urgency, considerations of comity counseled the exercise of discretion to withhold the writ at this early stage. In subsequent decisions, the Court continued to insist that state remedies be exhausted, even when the applicant alleged a lack of jurisdiction in state authorities which, if true, would have enabled the federal court to act on the application immediately. E.g., Ex parte Fonda, 117 U.S. 516, 6 S.Ct. 848, 29 L.Ed. 994; Cook v. Hart, 146 U.S. 183, 13 S.Ct. 40, 36 L.Ed. 934; New York v. Eno, 155 U.S. 89, 15 S.Ct. 30, 39 L.Ed. 80. As stated in Cook v. Hart, 146 U.S., at 195, 13 S.Ct., at 44, 'The party charged waives no defect of jurisdiction by submitting to a trial of his case upon the merits * * *. Should (his) rights be denied, his remedy in the federal court will remain unimpaired.' (Emphasis added.) The question whether the Constitution deprived the State of jurisdiction, in other words, would remain open under traditional doctrine, on collateral as well as direct attack.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "102\n",
      "There can be no doubt of the limited scope of habeas corpus during this formative period, and of the consistent efforts to confine the writ to questions of jurisdiction. But the cardinal point for present purposes is that in no case was it held, or even suggested, that habeas corpus would be available to consider any claims by a prisoner held pursuant to a state court judgment whose validity rested on an adequate nonfederal ground. Indeed, so long as the writ was confined to claims by state prisoners that the State was constitutionally precluded from exercising its jurisdiction in the particular case, it is difficult to conceive of a decision to detain in such cases resting on an adequate state ground. Even when the concept of jurisdiction was expanded, as in Ex parte Siebold, 100 U.S. 371, 25 L.Ed. 717, and other decisions, the matters open on habeas were still limited to those which were believed to have deprived the sentencing court of all competence to act, and which therefore could always be raised on collateral attack. It is for this reason that the Royall line of 'exhaustion' cases, relied on so heavily by the Court, has no real bearing on the problem before us. For those cases dealt only with the discretion of the court to take action which, if the allegations of lack of state jurisdiction were upheld, it would have had power to take either before or after state consideration. The issue here, on the other hand, is one of power, and wholly different considerations are involved.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "103\n",
      "In those few instances during this early period when the Court discussed questions it did not regard as jurisdictional, it occasionally went so far as to suggest that a constitutional claim could not be raised on habeas even if the state decision to detain rested on an inadequate state ground—that the only avenue of relief was direct review. Thus in Andrews v. Swartz, 156 U.S. 272, 15 S.Ct. 389, 39 L.Ed. 422, where the claim made on federal habeas was the systematic exclusion of Negroes from a state jury, the Court held it 'a sufficient answer to this contention that the state court had jurisdiction both of the offence charged and of the accused.' Id., at 276, 15 S.Ct., at 391. It continued:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "104\n",
      "'Even if it be assumed that the state court improperly denied  to the accused * * * the right to show by proof that persons  of his race were arbitrarily excluded * * * it would not  follow that the court lost jurisdiction of the case within  the meaning of the well-established rule that a prisoner  under conviction and sentence of another court will not be  discharged on habeas corpus unless the court that passed the  sentence was so far without jurisdiction that its proceedings  must be regarded as void.' Ibid.\n",

      "2. 1915—1953 period.—The next stage of development may be described as beginning in 1915 with Frank v. Mangum, 237 U.S. 309, 35 S.Ct. 582, 59 L.Ed. 969, and ending in 1953 with Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469. In Frank, the prisoner had claimed before the state courts that the proceedings in which he had been convicted for murder had been dominated by a mob, and the State Supreme Court, after consideration not only of the record but of extensive affidavits, had concluded that mob domination had not been established.9 Frank then sought federal habeas, and this Court affirmed the denial of relief. But in doing so the Court recognized that Frank's allegation of mob domination raised a constitutional question which he was entitled to have considered by a competent tribunal uncoerced by popular pressures. Such 'corrective process' had been afforded by the State Supreme Court, however, and since Frank had received 'notice and a hearing, or an opportunity to be heard' on his constitutional claims (237 U.S., at 326, 35 S.Ct., at 586, 59 L.Ed. 969), his detention was not in violation of federal law and habeas corpus would not lie.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "106\n",
      "It is clear that a new dimension was added to habeas corpus in this case, for in addition to questions previously thought of as 'jurisdictional,' the federal courts were now to consider whether the applicant had been given an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional claims before the state courts. And if no such opportunity had been afforded in the state courts, the federal claim would be heard on its merits. The Court thus rejected the views expressed in Andrews v. Swartz, supra, 372 U.S., p. 455, 83 S.Ct., p. 857, by holding, in effect, that a constitutional claim could be heard on habeas if the State's refusal to give it proper consideration rested on an inadequate state ground. But habeas would not lie to reconsider constitutional questions that had been fairly determined. And a fortiori it would not lie to consider a question when the state court's refusal to do so rested on an adequate and independent state ground.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "107\n",
      "In this connection, it is important to note the section of the opinion relating to Frank's separate constitutional claim that his involuntary absence from the courtroom at the time the verdict was rendered invalidated the conviction. Frank had failed to raise this point in his motion for a new trial; the state court held that it had been 'waived'; and this Court decided that the state rule barring assertion of the point after failure to raise it in a motion for new trial was reasonable and did not violate due process.10 Clearly, the significance of the Court's ruling was that as to this constitutional claim, whatever its merits if the point had been properly preserved, there was an adequate nonfederal ground for the detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "108\n",
      "In no case prior to Brown v. Allen, I submit, was there any substantial modification of the concepts articulated in the Frank decision. In Moore v. Dempsey, 261 U.S. 86, 43 S.Ct. 265, 67 L.Ed. 543, this Court did require a hearing on federal habeas of a claim similar to that in Frank, of mob domination of the trial, even though the state appellate court had purported to pass on the claim, but only by refusing to 'assume that the trial was an empty ceremony.'11 The decision of this Court is sufficiently ambiguous that it seems to have meant all things to all men.12 But I suggest that the decision cannot be taken to have overruled Frank; it did not purport to do so, and indeed it was joined by two Justices who had joined in the Frank opinion. Rather, what the Court appears to have held was that the state appellate court's perfunctory treatment of the question of mob domination, amounting to nothing more than reliance on the presumptive validity of the trial, was not in fact acceptable corrective process and federal habeas would therefore lie to consider the merits of the claim. Until today, the Court has consistently so interpreted the opinion, as in Ex parte Hawk, 321 U.S. 114, 118, 64 S.Ct. 448, 450, 88 L.Ed. 572, where Moore was cited as an example of a case in which 'the remedy afforded by state law proves in practice unavailable or seriously inadequate.' See also Jennings v. Illinois, 342 U.S. 104, 111, 72 S.Ct. 123, 127, 96 L.Ed. 119.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "109\n",
      "Certainly, there is no basis in the Moore opinion, whatever it may fairly be taken to mean, for concluding that the Court required consideration on federal habeas of a question which the state court had had an adequate state ground for refusing to consider. The claim of mob domination was considered, although apparently inadequately, by the state court, and it was only on this premise that the claim was required t be heard on habeas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "110\n",
      "Subsequent decisions involving state prisoners continued to indicate that the controlling question on federal habeas—apart from matters going to lack of state jurisdiction in light of federal law—was whether or not the State had afforded adequate opportunity to raise the federal claim. If not, the federal claim could be considered on its merits. See, e.g., Mooney v. Holohan, 294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791; White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760, 65 S.Ct. 978, 89 L.Ed. 1348; Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211, 66 S.Ct. 996, 90 L.Ed. 1177; cf. Jennings v. Illinois, 342 U.S. 104, 72 S.Ct. 123, 96 L.Ed. 119.13\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "111\n",
      "A development paralleling that in Frank v. Mangum took place during this period with regard to federal prisoners. The writ remained unavailable to consider questions that were or could have been raised in the original proceedings, or on direct appeal, see Sunal v. Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982, but it was employed to permit consideration of constitutional questions that could not otherwise have been adequately presented to the courts. E.g., Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 S.Ct. 1461; Walker v. Johnston, 312 U.S. 275, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830; Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. 101, 62 S.Ct. 964, 86 L.Ed. 1302. This limited scope of habeas corpus, and its statutory substitute 28 U.S.C. § 2255, in relation to federal prisoners may have survived Brown v. Allen and may still survive today. See, e.g., Franano v. United States, 8 Cir., 303 F.2d 470, cert. denied, 371 U.S. 865, 83 S.Ct. 125, 9 L.Ed.2d 102. Compare Jordan v. United States, 352 U.S. 904, 77 S.Ct. 151, 1 L.Ed.2d 114.\n",

      "To recapitulate, then, prior to Brown v. Allen, habeas corpus would not lie for a prisoner who was in custody pursuant to a state judgment of conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction if he had been given an adequate opportunity to obtain full and fair consideration of his federal claim in the state courts. Clearly, under this approach, a detention was not in violation of federal law if the validity of the state conviction on which that detention was based rested on an adequate nonfederal ground.\n",

      "3. Post-1953, Brown v. Allen, period.—In 1953, this Court rendered its landmark decisions in Brown v. Allen, 344 U.S. 443, 73 S.Ct. 397, 97 L.Ed. 469, and Daniels v. Allen, reported therewith, 344 U.S., at 482—487, 73 S.Ct., at 420—422.14 Both cases involved applications for federal habeas corpus by prisoners who were awaiting execution pursuant to state convictions. In both cases, the constitutional contentions made were that the trial court had erred in ruling confessions admissible and in overruling motions to quash the indictment on the basis of alleged discrimination in the selection of jurors.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "114\n",
      "In Brown, these contentions had been presented to the highest court of the State, on direct appeal from the conviction, and had been rejected by that court on the merits, State v. Brown, 233 N.C. 202, 63 S.E.2d 99, after which this Court had denied certiorari, 341 U.S. 943, 71 S.Ct. 997, 95 L.Ed. 1369. At this point, the Court held, Brown was entitled to full reconsideration of these constitutional claims, with a hearing if appropriate, in an application to a Federal District Court for habeas corpus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "115\n",
      "It is manifest that this decision substantially expanded the scope of inquiry on an application for federal habeas corpus.15 Frank v. Mangum and Moore v. Dempsey had denied that the federal courts in habeas corpus sat to determine whether errors of law, even constitutional law, had been made in the original trial and appellate proceedings. Under the decision in Brown, if a petitioner could show that the validity of a state decision to detain rested on a determination of a constitutional claim, and if he alleged that determination to be erroneous, the federal court had the right and the duty to satisfy itself of the correctness of the state decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "116\n",
      "But what if the validity of the state decision to detain rested not on the determination of a federal claim but rather on an adequate nonfederal ground which would have barred direct review by this Court? That was the questionin Daniels. The attorney for the petitioners in that case had failed to mail the appeal papers on the last day for filing, and although he delivered them by hand the next day, the State Supreme Court refused to entertain the appeal, ruling that it had not been filed on time. This ruling, this Court held, barred federal habeas corpus consideration of the claims that the state appellate court had refused to consider. Language in Mr. Justice Reed's opinion for the Court appeared to support the result alternatively in terms of waiver,16 failure to exhaust state remedies,17 and the existence of an adequate state ground.18 But while the explanation may have been ambiguous, the result was clear: habeas corpus would not lie for a prisoner who was detained pursuant to a state judgment which, in the view of the majority in Daniels, rested on a reasonable application of the State's own procedural requirements. Moreover, the issue was plainly viewed as one of authority, not of discretion. 344 U.S., at 485, 73 S.Ct., at 421, 97 L.Ed. 469.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "117\n",
      "I do not pause to reconsider here the question whether the state ground in Daniels was an adequate one; persuasive arguments can be made that it was not. The important point for present purposes is that the approach in Daniels was wholly consistent with established principles in the field of habeas corpus jurisdiction. The problem, however, had been brought into sharper focus by the result in Brown. Once it is made clear that the questions open on federal habeas extend to such matters as the admissibility of confessions, or of other evidence, the possibility that inquiry may be precluded by the existence of a state ground adequate to support the judgment is substantially increased.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "118\n",
      "Issues similar to those in Daniels next came before the Court in Irvin v. Dowd, 359 U.S. 394, 79 S.Ct. 825, 3 L.Ed.2d 900. In that case, the state court's decision affirming Irvin's conviction for murder was ambiguous and it could have been interpreted to rest on a state ground even though Irvin's federal constitutional claims were considered. Irvin v. State, 236 Ind. 384, 139 N.E.2d 898; see also the dissenting opinion of this writer in Irvin v. Dowd, supra, 359 U.S. 412, 79 S.Ct. 835, 3 L.Ed.2d 900. This Court, in reversing a dismissal of an application for federal habeas corpus, concluded that the state court decision had rested on determination of Irvin's federal claims, and held that those claims could therefore be considered on federal habeas. The majority appeared to approach the problem as one of exhaustion,19 but the basic determination was that the state court judgment, pursuant to which Irvin was detained, did not rest on an application of the State's procedural rules.\n",

There can, I think, be no doubt that today's holding—that federal habeas will lie despite the existence of an adequate and independent nonfederal ground for the judgment pursuant to which the applicant is detained—is wholly unprecedented. Indeed, it constitutes a direct rejection of authority that is squarely to the contrary. That the result now reached is a novel one does not, of course, mean that it is necessarily incorrect or unwise.

      "1. On direct review.—Assume that a man is indicted, and held for trial in a state court, by a grand jury from which members of his race have been systematically excluded. Assume further that the State requires any objection to the composition of the grand jury to be raised prior to the verdict, that no such objection is made, and that the defendant seeks to raise the point for the first time on appeal from his conviction. If the state appellate court refuses to consider the claim because it was raised too late, and if certiorari is sought and granted, the initial question before this Court will be whether there was an adequate state ground for the judgment below. If the petitioner was represented by counsel not shown to be incompetent, and if the necessary information to make the objection is not shown to have been unavailable at the time of trial, it is certain that the judgment of conviction will stand, despite the fact the indictment was obtained in violation of the petitioner's constitutional rights.20\n",

      "What is the reason for the rule that an adequate and independent state ground of decision bars Supreme Court review of that decision—a rule which, of course, is as applicable to procedural as to substantive grounds? In Murdock v. Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 632—636, 22 L.Ed. 429, it was concluded that under the governing statute (i) the Court did not have jurisdiction, on review of a state decision, to examine and decide 'questions not of a Federal character,' id., at 633, and (ii) an erroneous decision of a federal question by a state court could not warrant reversal if there were:\n",

      "123\n",
      "'any other matter or issue adjudged by the State court, which  is sufficiently broad to maintain the judgment of that court,  notwithstanding the error in deciding the issue raised by the  Federal question.' Id., at 636.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "124\n",
      "But as the Court in Murdock so strongly implied, and as emphasized in subsequent decisions, the adequate state ground rule has roots far deeper than the statutes governing our jurisdiction, and rests on fundamentals that touch this Court's habeas corpus jurisdiction equally with its direct reviewing power. An examination of the alternatives that might conceivably be followed will, I submit, confirm that the rule is one of constitutional dimensions going to the heart of the division of judicial powers in a federal system.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "125\n",
      "One alternative to the present rule would be for the Court to review and decide any federal questions in the case, even if the determination of nonfederal questions were adequate to sustain the judgment below, and then to send the case back to the state court for further consideration. But it needs no extended analysis to demonstrate that such action would exceed this Court's powers under Article III. As stated in Herb v. Pitcairn, 324 U.S. 117, 126, 65 S.Ct. 459, 463, 89 L.Ed. 789:\n",

      "'(O)ur power is to correct wrong judgments, not to revise  opinions. We are not permitted to render an advisory opinion,  and if the same judgment would be rendered by the state court  after we corrected its views of federal laws, our review  could amount to nothing more than an advisory opinion.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "127\n",
      "Another alternative, which would avoid the problem of advisory opinions, would be to take the entire case and to review on the merits the state court's decision of every question in it. For example, in our hypothetical case the Court might consider on its merits the question whether the state court correctly ruled that under state law objections to the composition of the grand jury must be made prior to the verdict.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "128\n",
      "To a limited extent, of course, this procedural ruling of the state court raises federal as well as state questions. It is clear that a State may not preclude Supreme Court review of federal claims by discriminating against or evading the assertion of a federal right, and indeed that state procedural grounds for refusal to consider a federal claim must rest on a 'fair or substantial basis.'21 Occasionally this means that a state procedural rule which may properly preclude the raising of state claims in a state court cannot thwart review of federal claims in this Court.22 These principles are inherent in the concept that a state ground, to be of sufficient breadth to support the judgment, must be both 'adequate' and 'independent.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "129\n",
      "But determination of the adequacy and independence of the state ground, I submit, marks the constitutional limit of our power in this sphere. The reason why this is so was perhaps most articulately expressed in a different but closely related context by Mr. Justice Field in his opinion in Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Baugh, 149 U.S. 368, 401, 13 S.Ct. 914, 37 L.Ed. 772. He stated, in a passage quoted with approval by the Court in the historic decision in Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78—79, 58 S.Ct. 817, 822, 82 L.Ed. 1188:\n",

      "'(T)he constitution of the United States * * * recognizes and  preserves the autonomy and independence of the states,  independence in their legislative and independence in their  judicial departments. Supervision over either the legislative  or the judicial action of the states is in no case  permissible except as to matters by the constitution  specifically authorized or delegated to the United States.  Any interference with either, except as thus permitted, is an  invasion of the authority of the state, and, to that extent,  a denial of its independence.'\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "131\n",
      "For this Court to go beyond the adequacy of the state ground and to review and determine the correctness of that ground on its merits would, in our hypothetical cae, be to assume full control over a State's procedures for the administration of its own criminal justice. This is and must be beyond our power if the federal system is to exist in substance as well as form. The right of the State to regulate its own procedures governing the conduct of litigants in its courts, and its interest in supervision of those procedures, stand on the same constitutional plane as its right and interest in framing 'substantive' laws governing other aspects of the conduct of those within its borders.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "132\n",
      "There is still a third possible course this Court might follow if it were to reject the adequate state ground rule. The Act of 1867, which in § 1 extended the habeas corpus jurisdiction to state prisoners detained in violation of federal law, in § 2 gave the Supreme Court the authority, in cases coming from the state courts, to order execution directly without remanding the case. 14 Stat. 385, 386—387. That authority, which has been exercised at least once,23 remained unimpaired through the modifications of appellate and certiorari jurisdiction,24 and exists today.25 Acting pursuant to that authority in our hypothetical case, this Court might grant certiorari, 'ignore' the state ground of decision, decide the federal question and, instead of merely remanding the case, issue a writ requiring the petitioner's release from custody. By this simple device, the Court, it might be argued, would avoid problems of advisory opinions while at the same time refraining from consideration of questions of state law.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "133\n",
      "But apart from the unseemliness of such a dispoition, it is apparent that what the Court would actually be doing would be to decide the state law question sub silentio and to reverse the state court judgment on that question. For if the petitioner is detained pursuant to the judgment, and his detention is to be terminated, that must mean that the state ground is not adequate to support the only purpose for which the judgment was rendered. The judgment, in other words, becomes a nullity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "134\n",
      "Moreover, the future effect of such a disposition is precisely the same as a reversal on the merits of the question of state law. If noncompliance with a state rule requiring a particular constitutional claim to be raised before verdict does not preclude consideration of the claim by this Court, then the rule is invalid in every significant sense, since no judgment based on its application can ever be effective.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "135\n",
      "In short, the constitutional infirmities of such a disposition by this Court are the same as those inherent in review of the state question on its merits. The vice, however, is greater because the Court would, in actuality, be invalidating a state rule without even purporting to consider it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "136\n",
      "2. On habeas corpus.—The adequate state ground doctrine thus finds its source in basic constitutional principles, and the question before us is whether this is as true in a collateral attack in habeas corpus as on direct review. Assume, then, that after dismissal of the writ of certiorari in our hypothetical case, the prisoner seeks habeas corpus in a Federal District Court, again complaining of the composition of the grand jury that indicted him. Is that federal court constitutionally more free than the Supreme Court on direct review to 'ignore' the adequate state ground, proceed to the federal question, and order the prisoner's release?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "137\n",
      "The answer must be that it is not. Of course, as the majority states, a judgment is not a 'jurisdictional prerequisite' to a habeas corpus application, ante, p. 430 but that is wholly irrelevant. The point is that if the applicant is detained pursuant to a judgment, termination of the detention necessarily nullifies the judgment. The fact that a District Court on habeas has fewer choices than the Supreme Court, since it can only act on the body of the prisoner, does not alter the significance of the exercise of its power. In habeas as on direct review, ordering the prisoner's release invalidates the judgment of conviction and renders ineffective the state rule relied upon to sustain that judgment. Try as the majority does to turn habeas corpus into a roving commission of inquiry into every possible invasion of the applicant's civil rights that may ever have occurred, it cannot divorce the writ from a judgment of conviction if that judgment is the basis of the detention.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "138\n",
      "Thus in the present case if this Court had granted certiorari to review the State's denial of coram nobis, had considered the coerced confession claim, and had ordered Noia's release, the necessary effects of that disposition would have been (1) to set aside the conviction and (2) to invalidate application of the New York rule requiring the claim to be raised on direct appeal in order to be preserved. It is, I think, beyond dispute that the Court does exactly the same thing by affirming the decision below in this case. In doing so, the Court exceeds its constitutional power if in fact the state ground relied upon to sustain the judgment of conviction is an adequate one. See pp. 472—476, infra. The effect of of the approach adopted by the Court is, indeed, to do away with the adequate state ground rule entirely in every state case, involving a federal question, in which detention follows from a judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "139\n",
      "The majority seems to recognize at least some of the consequences of its decision when it attempts to fill the void created by abolition of the adequate state ground rule in state criminal cases. But the substitute it has fashioned—that of 'conscious waiver' or 'deliberate bypassing' of state procedures is, as I shall next try to show, wholly unsatisfactory.\n",

      "ATTEMPTED PALLIATIVES.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "141\n",
      "Apparently on the basis of a doctrine analogous to that of 'unclean hands,' the Court states that a federal judge, in his discretion, may deny relief on habeas corpus to one who has understandingly and knowingly refused to avail himself of state procedures. But such a test, if it is meant to constitute a limitation on interference with state administration of criminal justice, falls far short of the mark. In fact, as explained and applied in this case, it amounts to no limitation at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "142\n",
      "First, the Court explains that the test is one calling for the exercise of the district judge's discretion, that the judge may, in other words, grant relief even when a conscious waiver has been shown. Thus the Court does not merely tell the States that, if they wish to detain those whom they convict, they must revamp their entire systems of criminal procedures so that no forfeiture may be imposed in the absence of deliberate choice; the States are also warned that even a deliberate, explicit, intelligent choice not to assert a constitutional right may not preclude its assertion on federal habeas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "143\n",
      "Second, the Court states (as it must if it is to adhere to its definition) that '(a) choice made by counsel not participated in by the petitioner does not automatically bar relief.' Ante, p. 439. It is true that there are cases in which the adequacy of the state ground necessarily turns on the question whether the defendant himself expressly and intelligently waived a constitutional right. Foremost among these are the cases involving right to counsel, for the Court has made it clear that this right cannot be foregone without deliberate choice by the defendant. See Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461; Carnley v. Cochran, 369 U.S. 506, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70. But to carry this principle over in full force to cases in which a defendant is represented by counsel not shown to be incompetent is to undermine the entire representational system. We have manifested an ever-increasing awareness of the fundamental importance of representation by counsel, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, and yet today the Court suggests that the State may no more have a rule of forfeiture for one who is competently represented than for one who is not. The effect on state procedural rules may be disastrous.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "144\n",
      "Third, when it comes to apply the 'waiver' test in this case, the Court then in effect reads its own creation out of existence. Recognizing that Noia himself decided not to appeal, and that he apparently made this choice after consultation with counsel, the Court states that his decision was nevertheless not a 'waiver.' Since a new trial might have resulted in a death sentence, Noia was, in the majority's view, confronted with a 'grisly choice,' and he quite properly declined to play 'Russian roulette' by appealing his conviction. Ante, pp. 439—440.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "145\n",
      "Does the Court mean by these colorful phrases that it would be unconstitutional for the State to impose a heavier sentence in a second trial for the same offense? Apparently not, since the majority assures us that there may be some cases in which a risk of a heavier sentence must be run. What distinguishes this case, we are told, is that the risk of the death sentence on a new trial was substantial in view of the trial judge's statement that Noia's past record and his involvement in the crime almost led the judge to disregard the jury's recommendation against a death sentence.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "146\n",
      "What the Court seems to be saying in this exercise in fine distinctions is that no waiver of a right can be effective if some adverse consequence might reasonably be expected to follow from exercise of that right. Under this approach, of course, there could never be a binding waiver, since only an incompetent would give up a right without any good reason, and an incompetent cannot make an intelligent waiver. The Court wholly ignores the question whether the choice made by the defendant is one that the State could constitutionally require.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "147\n",
      "Looked at from any angle, the concept of waiver which the Court has created must be found wanting. Of gravest importance, it carries this Court into a sphere in which it has no proper place in the context of the federal system. The true limitations on our constitutional power are those inherent in the rule requiring that a judgment resting on an adequate state ground must be respected.\n",

      "\n",
      "150\n",
      "New York asserts that a claim of the kind involved here must be raised on timely appeal if it is to be preserved, and contends that in permitting an appeal it has provided a reasonable opportunity for the claim to be made. The collateral post-conviction writ of coram nobis, the State has said, remains a remedy only for the calling up of facts unknown at the time of the judgment. See People v. Noia, decided sub nom. People v. Caminito, 3 N.Y.2d 596, 601, 170 N.Y.S.2d 799, 804, 148 N.E.2d 139, 143. In other words, the State claims that it may constitutionally detain a man pursuant to a judgment of conviction, regardless of any error that may have led to that conviction, if the relevant facts were reasonably available and an appeal was not taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "151\n",
      "Under the circumstances here—particularly the fact that Noia was represented by counsel whose competence is not challenged—is this a reasonable ground for barring collateral assertion of the federal claim? Certainly the State has a vital interest in requiring that appeals be taken on the basis of facts known at the time, since the first assertion of a claim many years later might otherwise require release long after it was feasible to hold a new trial. And although in Daniels v. Allen it might have been argued that the State's refusal to entertain an appeal actually received on time amounted to an evasion of the federal claim. no such argument can be made here, since no appeal was ever sought.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "152\n",
      "Moreover, we should be slow to reject—as an invalid barrier to the raising of a federal right—a state determination that one forum rather than another must be resorted to for the assertion of that right. A far more rigid restriction of federal forums was upheld in Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834. In that case, the Court sustained a federal statute permitting an attack on the validity of an administrative price regulation to be made only on timely review of the administrative order, and precluding the defense of invalidity in a later criminal prosecution for violation of the regulation. What the Court there said bears repetition here:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "153\n",
      "'No procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than  that a constitutional right may be forfeited in criminal as  well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion  of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to  determine it.' 321 U.S., at 444, 64 S.Ct., at 677.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "154\n",
      "But is there some special circumstance here that operates to invalidate the nonfederal ground? Certainly it cannot be that the claim of a coerced confession is of such a nature that a State is constitutionally compelled to permit its assertion at any time even if it could have been, but was not, raised on appeal. Many federal decisions have held that a federal prisoner held pursuant to a federal conviction may not assert such a claim in collateral proceedings when it was not, but could have been, asserted on appeal. E.g., Davis v. United States, 7 Cir., 214 F.2d 594, cert. denied, 353 U.S. 960, 77 S.Ct. 870, 1 L.Ed.2d 911; Smith v.

Does the nonfederal ground fall when the federal claim appears to have obvious merit? There may be some question whether the facts in Noia's case and those in Bonino's and Caminito's are identical,27 but assuming that they are, I think it evident that the nonfederal ground must still stand.\n",

Large, 332 U.S. 174, 67 S.Ct. 1588, 91 L.Ed. 1982, Sunal and Kulick had been prosecuted for violation of the Selective Service Act, and both had sought to raise a defense the court had refused to consider. Both were convicted and sentenced to imprisonment but took no appeal, quite evidently because such an appeal would have been to no avail under the existing state of the law. Subsequently, in another case, this Court held on comparable facts that the defense in question must be permitted. Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 66 S.Ct. 423, 90 L.Ed. 567. Sunal and Kulick then sought relief on habeas corpus, and this relief was denied. The opinion of the Court observed that there had been no barrier to the perfection of appeals by these prisoners and no facts which were not then known. That an appeal may have appeared futile at the time (indeed, far more futile than was the case here) was held not a sufficient basis for collateral relief. The present case, I submit, would be less troublesome than Sunal even had it involved a federal prisoner.\n",

      "\n",
      "157\n",
      "Surely, the state ground is not rendered inadequate because on a new trial for the same offense, Noia might have received the death sentence. The State is well within constitutional limits in permitting such a sentence to be imposed. Of particular relevance here is the decision in Larson v. United States, 5 Cir., 275 F.2d 673. Two criminal defendants had been tried and sentenced to imprisonment by a federal court. One defendant, Juelich, had moved for a continuance or a change of venue, on the ground of community prejudice, and his motion had been denied. Both defendants were convicted; Juelich appealed from his conviction; and the Court of Appeals reversed, Juelich v. United States, 5 Cir., 214 F.2d 950, holding that the constitutional requirement of a fair trial had been violated by the refusal to grant a change of venue or a continuance. Larson, the other defendant, had chosen not to appeal, apparently because he feared that the death sentence might be imposed in a new trial, but after his codefendant's success, he sought collateral relief under § 2255.

Motions to reargue appeals in the New York Court of Appeals may be made at any time. Caminito filed motions for reargument in 1948 and 1954. The motions were denied. 297 N.Y. 882, 79 N.E.2d 277; 307 N.Y. 686, 120 N.E.2d 857; we denied certiorari from the second denial. 348 U.S. 839, 75 S.Ct. 46, 99 L.Ed. 662.

      "The District Court held a hearing limited to an inquiry into the facts surrounding Noia's failure to appeal but made no findings as to Noia's reasons. Noia and the lawyer who defended him at his trial testified. Noia said that while aware of his right to appeal, he did not appeal because he did not wish to saddle his family with an additional financial burden and had no funds of his own. The gist of the lawyer's testimony was that Noia was also motivated not to appeal by fear that if successful he might get the death sentence if convicted on a retrial. The trial judge, not bound to accept the jury's recommendation of a life sentence, had said when sentencing him, 'I have thought seriously about rejecting the recommendation of the jury in your case, Noia, because I feel that if the jury knew who you were and what you were and your background as a robber, they would not have made a recommendation. But you have got a good lawyer, that is my wife. The last thing she told me this morning is to give you a chance.' Record, ff. 2261—2262.

All the significant statutory changes in the federal writ have been prompted by grave political crises. The first modification of the provisions of the Judiciary Act of 1789 was made in the Force Act of March 2, 1833, c. 57, § 7, 4 Stat. 634 635, in response to South Carolina's nullification ordinance. The Act provided that federal courts and judges could release from state custody persons who had been acting under federal authority. The Act of August 29, 1842, c. 257, 5 Stat. 539—540, which extended federal habeas to foreign nationals acting under authority of a foreign state, was prompted by British diplomatic protest following the trial of a Canadian soldier by a New York State court. See People v. McLeod, 25 Wend. 483 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1841). The Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, § 1, 14 Stat. 385—386, which extended federal habeas to state prisoners generally, was passed in anticipation of possible Southern recalcitrance toward Reconstruction legislation. See p. 415. That was the last important statutory change.

But this exception was not intended to have the effect of denying the protection of habeas corpus for such persons in appropriate cases. Rather, such persons were excluded simply from the coverage of the Act and remitted to their common-law rights to habeas—as construed, for example, in Bushell's case—because the Act was designed to meet the problem of bail, which had principal relevance at the preconviction stage.

      "The argument has recently been advanced that the Moore decision did not in fact discredit the position advanced by the Court in Frank v. Mangum (that habeas would lie only if the state courts had failed to afford petitioner corrective process), and that this position was first upset in Brown v. Allen. Bator, Finality in Criminal Law and Federal Habeas Corpus for State Prisoners, 76 Harv.L.Rev. 441, 488—500 (1963). The argument would seem untenable in light of certain factors: (1) The opinion of the Court in Moore, written by Mr. Justice Holmes, is a virtual paraphrase of his dissenting opinion in Frank. (2) The thesis of the Frank majority finds no support in other decisions of the Court; though the availability of corrective process is sometimes mentioned as a factor bearing upon grant or denial of federal habeas, such language typically appears in the context of the exhaustion problem; indeed, 'available State corrective process' is part of the language of 28 U.S.C. § 2254. See, e.g., White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760, 764, 65 S.Ct. 978, 980, 89 L.Ed. 1348. (3) None of the opinions in Brown v. Allen even remotely suggests that the Court was changing the existing law in allowing coerced confessions and racial discrimination in jury selection to be challenged on habeas notwithstanding state court review of the merits of these constitutional claims.\n",

      " Lord Herschell, in Cox v. Hakes, (1890) 15 A.C. 506, 527 528 (H.L.), described the English practice as follows: 'No Court was bound by the view taken by any other, or felt itself obliged to follow the law laid down by it. Each Court exercised its independent judgment upon the case, and determined for itself whether the return to the writ established that the detention of the applicant was in accordance with the law. A person detained in custody might thus proceed from court to court until he obtained his liberty. * * * I need not dwell upon the security which was thus afforded against any unlawful imprisonment. It is sufficient to say that no person could be detained in custody if any one of the tribunals having power to issue the writ of habeas corpus was of opinion that the custody was unlawful.' This practice has lately been changed by statute, Administration of Justice Act, 1960, 8 & 9 Eliz. II, c. 65, § 14(2).\n",

      " It has been suggested that language in such cases as White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760, 765, 65 S.Ct. 978, 981, 89 L.Ed. 1348, and House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 48, 65 S.Ct. 517, 521, 89 L.Ed. 739, supports the result reached today by indicating that federal habeas will lie when an adequate state ground bars direct review by this Court. See Brennan, supra, note 1, at 431—432, n. 51; Reitz, spra, note 1, at 1359—1360. But these cases do not stand for this proposition. In each of them the state court appeared to have denied that the particular post-conviction remedy sought was available to redress a claim of federal right that could not have been adequately asserted in the original trial. In each of them, it remained possible that other state remedies might be open, in which event it seemed clear that the particular denial of relief rested on an adequate state ground. But if it was subsequently determined—either by further attempts to obtain state relief or by proof in a Federal District Court—that no state remedies of any kind were ever available in the state courts, then federal habeas would lie. For, 'it is not simply a question of state procedure,' and there is no truly adequate state ground, 'when a state court of last resort closes the door to any consideration of a claim of denial of a federal right.' Young v. Ragen, 337 U.S. 235, 238, 69 S.Ct. 1073, 1074, 93 L.Ed. 1333; cf. Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, 253 U.S. 17, 40 S.Ct. 419, 64 L.Ed. 751; General Oil Co. v. Crain, 209 U.S. 211, 28 S.Ct. 475, 52 L.Ed. 754. In other words, the proposition that cases such as White v. Ragen do stand for is that this Court will, as a matter of sound judicial administration, accept what appears on its face to be an adequate state ground because the Federal District Court remains open for more intensive consideration of the petitioner's claim of inadequacy.

See Lindh, supra, at 323 (noting that petitioner filed his federal habeas application on July 9, 1992). Since Lindh, the Courts of Appeals have divided on the question whether AEDPA applies to a habeas application filed after AEDPA's effective date if the applicant sought the appointment of counsel or a stay of execution (or both) prior to that date. Five Courts of Appeals have ruled that AEDPA applies, see, e.g., Isaacs v. Head, 300 F.3d 1232, 1245-1246 (CA11 2002); Moore v. Gibson, 195 F.3d 1152, 1160-1163 (CA10 1999); Gosier v.

Cain, 125 F.3d 269, 273-274 (CA5 1997), while the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has held it does not, Calderon, supra, at 539-540. For the reasons stated below, we agree with the majority of the Courts of Appeals.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "6\n",
      "Congress enacted AEDPA to reduce delays in the execution of state and federal criminal sentences, particularly in capital cases, see Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 386 (2000) (opinion of Stevens, J.) (\"Congress wished to curb delays, to prevent `retrials' on federal habeas, and to give effect to state convictions to the extent possible under law\"); see also id., at 404 (majority opinion), and \"to further the principles of comity, finality, and federalism,\" Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 420, 436 (2000). One of the methods Congress used to advance these objectives was the adoption of an amended 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). Williams, 529 U.S., at 404 (\"It cannot be disputed that Congress viewed § 2254(d)(1) as an important means by which its goals for habeas reform would be achieved\"). As we have explained before, § 2254(d) places \"new constraint[s] on the power of a federal habeas court to grant a state prisoner's application for a writ of habeas corpus with respect to claims adjudicated on the merits in state court.\" Id., at 412. Our cases make clear that AEDPA in general and § 2254(d) in particular focus in large measure on revising the standards used for evaluating the merits of a habeas application. See id., at 412-413; Lindh, 521 U.S., at 329 (noting that \"amended § 2254(d) . . . governs standards affecting entitlement to relief\"); see also Early v. Packer, 537 U.S. ___ (2002) (per curiam) (applying AEDPA's standards); Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. ___ (2002) (per curiam) (same).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "7\n",
      "Because of AEDPA's heavy emphasis on the standards governing the review of the merits of a habeas application, we interpret the rule announced in Lindh in view of that emphasis, as have the majority of the Courts of Appeals. See, e.g., Holman v. Gilmore, 126 F.3d 876, 880 (CA7 1997) (\"[T]he motion for counsel is not itself a petition, because it does not call for (or even permit) a decision on the merits. And it is `the merits' that the amended § 2254(d)(1) is all about\"); Isaacs, supra, at 1245 (same); Coyle, supra, at 1040 (same). Thus, whether AEDPA applies to a state prisoner turns on what was before a federal court on the date AEDPA became effective. If, on that date, the state prisoner had before a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims, then amended § 2254(d) does not apply. Otherwise, an application filed after AEDPA's effective date should be reviewed under AEDPA, even if other filings by that same applicant — such as, for example, a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay of execution — were presented to a federal court prior to AEDPA's effective date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "8\n",
      "A review of the amended chapter 153 supports our conclusion. For instance, § 2254(e)(1) provides that, \"[i]n a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.\" (Emphasis added.) Under the Ninth Circuit's view, the presumption established in § 2254(e)(1) would rarely apply in a capital case. If, as the Ninth Circuit held, a capital habeas case can be commenced (and, therefore, may become pending for purposes of Lindh) with the filing of a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay, then § 2254(e)(1), which by its terms applies only to a proceeding \"instituted\" by \"an application for a writ of habeas corpus,\" would not apply to any capital prisoners whose first filing in federal court is a request for the appointment of counsel or a motion for a stay. This would make § 2254(e)(1) applicable only to those capital prisoners who did not need counsel and did not seek a stay. AEDPA's text, however, contains no indication that § 2254(e)(1) was intended to have such a limited scope. Nor is it reasonable to believe that Congress meant for a capital prisoner to avoid the application of the stringent requirements of § 2254(e)(1) simply by filing a request for counsel or a motion for a stay before filing an actual application for habeas relief. Other provisions of chapter 153 likewise support our view. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2241(d) (indicating that the power to grant a writ is not triggered except by \"application for a writ of habeas corpus\"); § 2244(a) (providing that federal judges are not required to \"entertain\" a second or successive \"application for a writ of habeas corpus\" except as provided for by statute).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "9\n",
      "Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the procedural rules governing § 2254 cases. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 3 explains that \"[a] civil action is commenced by filing a complaint.\" The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in the context of habeas suits to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254 Rule 11; Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 81(a)(2); Pitchess v. Davis, 421 U.S. 482, 489 (1975) (per curiam). Nothing in the Habeas Corpus Rules contradicts Rule 3. The logical conclusion, therefore, is that a habeas suit begins with the filing of an application for habeas corpus relief — the equivalent of a complaint in an ordinary civil case.\n",

      "Respondent asks us to determine the scope of the rule announced in Lindh by looking at some of the provisions of chapter 154 of Title 28. But our task in this case is to apply Lindh to an action under chapter 153; thus, the precise phrasing of provisions in chapter 154 is inapposite to our inquiry here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "11\n",
      "Moreover, respondent's argument that our holding in McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849 (1994), should inform our decision here is unpersuasive. To begin with, McFarland involved the interpretation of § 2251, not § 2254, which is at issue here. And, as the Courts of Appeals have recognized, see Isaacs, 300 F.3d, at 1242-1246 (collecting and discussing authorities), the Court's ruling in McFarland must be understood in light of the Court's concern to protect the right to counsel contained in 18 U.S.C. § 848(q)(4)(B). McFarland, 512 U.S., at 855 (\"This interpretation is the only one that gives meaning to the statute as a practical matter\"); id., at 856 (\"Requiring an indigent capital petitioner to proceed without counsel in order to obtain counsel thus would expose him to the substantial risk that his habeas claims never would be heard on the merits. Congress legislated against this legal backdrop in adopting § 848(q)(4)(B), and we safely assume that it did not intend for the express requirement of counsel to be defeated in this manner\"); id., at 857 (\"Even if the District Court had granted McFarland's motion for appointment of counsel and had found an attorney to represent him, this appointment would have been meaningless unless McFarland's execution also was stayed\"). Thus, McFarland cannot carry the day for respondent.\n",

      "12\n",
      "Similarly, the Ninth Circuit's and respondent's reliance on Hohn v. United States, 524 U.S. 236 (1998), is misplaced. In Hohn, we considered whether this Court has jurisdiction to review a court of appeals' denial of a certificate of appealability (COA). To answer that question we focused on the text of 28 U.S.C. § 1254, which \"confines our jurisdiction to '[c]ases in' the courts of appeals.\" Hohn, supra, at 241 (citing Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 741-742 (1982)). Although we concluded that an application for a COA constituted a case within the meaning of § 1254, we did not provide an all-purpose definition of the term \"case.\" Thus, while Hohn might support an argument that respondent's request for appointment of counsel and his motion for a stay of execution began a \"case\" that could be reviewed on appeal, see, e.g., Gosier, 175 F.3d, at 506 (\"[A] request for counsel is a `case' in the sense that it is subject to appellate review (and, if need be, review by the Supreme Court)\"), it says nothing about whether a request for counsel or motion for a stay suffices to create a \"case\" that is \"pending\" within the meaning of the Lindh rule.\n",

      " Justice O'Connor contends that we may have misapplied our test because a filing labeled \"Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues\" placed themerits of respondent's claims before the District Court before AEDPA's effective date. Post, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment). That is simply not so. Respondent's \"Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues\" plainly stated that \"[b]ased on a preliminary review of case materials, counsel believes the following federal constitutional issues exist in this case and are among the issues that may be raised on [Garceau's] behalf in a petition for habeas corpus.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 227 (emphasis added). The clear import of this language is that the filing itself did not seek any relief on the merits or place the merits of respondent's claims before the District Court for decision. Rather, the document simply alerted the District Court as to some of the possible claims that might be raised by respondent in the future. Indeed, the habeas corpus application respondent eventually filed contained numerous issues that were not mentioned in the \"Specification of Non-Frivolous Issues.\"\n",

      "The Court today holds that the post-Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) version of 28 U.S.C. § 2254 applies to respondent Robert Garceau's habeas corpus application because Garceau did not file his application until after AEDPA's effective date. I agree with that holding. I concur only in the judgment, however, because in my view the Court's reasoning is broader than necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "18\n",
      "The Court states that if \"the state prisoner had before a federal court an application for habeas relief seeking an adjudication on the merits of the petitioner's claims, then amended § 2254(d) does not apply.\" Ante, at 4. Under the facts of this case, however, the Court may have misapplied its own rule. As the Court concedes, ante, at 2, the District Court had a pre-AEDPA filing setting forth the merits of Garceau's claims. After Garceau filed a motion for the appointment of counsel, motion for a stay, and motion for leave to file a habeas application, the District Court stayed Garceau's execution. Over the objection of the State, the District Court held that Garceau had identified non-frivolous issues so that a stay of the execution was appropriate. It is difficult to see how the \"merits\" were not in front of the District Court at that time, which was well before AEDPA's effective date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "19\n",
      "In addition, the Court does not adequately distinguish McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.S. 849 (1994). Although I dissented from that case, I also recognize that \"the doctrine of stare decisis is most compelling\" when the Court confronts \"a pure question of statutory construction.\" Hilton v. South Carolina Public Railways Comm'n, 502 U.S. 197, 205 (1991). The Court here, however, appears to adopt the reasoning of the dissent in McFarland. Compare ante, at 5 (\"Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the procedural rules governing § 2254 cases\") with McFarland supra, at 862 (O'Connor, J., dissenting in relevant part) (\"The rules governing § 2254 cases confirm this conclusion\"). I see no need to question the underpinnings of McFarland in this case, and I accept the holding of McFarland that an application for a writ of habeas corpus is not necessary to trigger the beginning of a habeas proceeding. See, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2251, 2262.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "20\n",
      "I agree, however, with the Court's conclusion that the post-AEDPA version of § 2254 is applicable to Garceau's case. The text of § 2254 itself provides the answer. Both before and after AEDPA, § 2254 has concerned only applications for a writ of habeas corpus. Compare § 2254(a) (\"The Supreme Court, a Justice thereof, a circuit judge, or a district court shall entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus . . .\" (emphasis added)) with 28 U.S.C. § 2254(a) (1994 ed.) (same). Indeed, only the filing of an application for a writ of habeas corpus triggered the former version of § 2254(d). See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (1994 ed.) (\"In any proceeding instituted in a Federal court by an application for a writ of habeas corpus . . .\"). Thus, although Garceau's preapplication filings trigger a habeas corpus proceeding sufficient to permit the District Court to grant a stay under 28 U.S.C. § 2251 and to engage in other activity related to the case, these filings do not answer whether the pre- or post-AEDPA version of § 2254(d) applies here. Because § 2254 has always spoken in terms of \"applications,\" a case is pending for § 2254 purposes only when the prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "21\n",
      "I acknowledge that some language in Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320 (1997), and in McFarland, supra, can be read to say that if a habeas case is pending before AEDPA, none of AEDPA's amendments apply — including the amendments to § 2254. But these statements do not answer the question in this case. If § 2254 applied to habeas proceedings other than applications for a writ of habeas corpus, the answer might well be different. Compare 28 U.S.C. § 2251 (a judge, \"before whom a habeas corpus proceeding is pending, may, . . . stay any proceeding\") with § 2254(e)(1) (\"In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus . . .\"). But as the Court correctly points out, ante, at 4-5, § 2254 applies only once a prisoner has filed \"an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\" § 2254(a). See also §§ 2254(b)(1), 2254(b)(2), 2254(d), 2254(e)(1).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "22\n",
      "It does not follow from our case law, nor does it follow from the text of § 2254 or any other habeas provision, that a habeas applicant can receive the benefit of the pre-AEDPA version of § 2254 when § 2254 itself cannot be triggered until the prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus. A \"case\" simply could not have existed for purposes of § 2254 until Garceau filed the application itself. Finally, Garceau has no reliance interest here. The pre-AEDPA version of § 2254(d) specifically acknowledged that a habeas applicant was entitled to the then-existing less-restrictive version of § 2254(d) only when the prisoner \"instituted\" a \"proceeding . . . by an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\" 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) (1994 ed.).\n",

      "Because 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is triggered only when a prisoner files an application for a writ of habeas corpus, and because Garceau filed his petition after AEDPA's date, I concur in the judgment of the Court that the post-AEDPA version of § 2254(d) governs his claim.\n",

      "In modifying 28 U.S.C. § 2254, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, did not specifically identify the state habeas cases that the amended statute would govern, except in certain capital cases subject to special rules not applicable here. Lindh v. Murphy, 521 U.S. 320, 326 (1997), held that in the statute's general application, the amendments cover only cases filed after AEDPA's effective date. Here we have to take the further step of deciding when a case is filed for purposes of the Lindh rule.\n",

      "\n",

      "The majority focuses on 28 U.S.C. § 2254 alone, which is fair enough where a habeas petitioner's first encounter with the district court occurs in filing the petition for habeas relief itself. But this is not such a case. Garceau first entered the federal court to seek appointment of habeas counsel under 21 U.S.C. § 848(b)(4)(B), and his subsequently appointed lawyer then petitioned under 28 U.S.C. § 2251 for a stay of execution while preparing a habeas petition. I therefore think this case calls for the principle that related statutory provisions are to be read together, see, e.g., Coit Independence Joint Venture v. FSLIC, 489 U.S. 561, 573 (1989) (citing Brown v. Duchesne, 19 How. 183, 194 (1857)). AEDPA's amendment of § 2254 ought to be understood in light of § 2251.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "27\n",
      "When counsel, appointed to prepare and litigate a habeas petition under § 2254, seeks a stay of execution under § 2251, the district court will at some point condition the continuation of any stay on its assessment of the substantiality of the issues counsel expects to raise in the petition yet to be filed, a judgment that will call for some consideration of standards for federal relief in cases governed by § 2254. When a district court's exercise of jurisdiction for habeas purposes occurs during the transition from an earlier to a later version of § 2254, it makes sense to hold that the version to be applied in a given case is the one in effect when the habeas court first takes account of § 2254 standards for habeas relief. A case should thus be considered filed for purposes of the Lindh rule by the time the habeas court makes a determination that takes standards for federal relief into consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "28\n",
      "When the District Court took its initial look at anticipated claims in this case, for example, it was clear that the habeas petition might well be filed before the effective date of the amendment to § 2254; it was thus appropriate for the District Court to consider the possible merit of the claim in light of the earlier, existing law. As a consequence, it would be reasonable to apply that law throughout. There would not be much point, after all, in relying on existing law to judge the merits of a stay, if counsel could not rely on existing law in preparing the case. Otherwise the court could be staying a case that might be hopeless under the later, more restrictive, law; or conversely, would be forcing counsel to stint on responsible preparation, in order to assure that a petition subject to the earlier law be filed before AEDPA's general effective date. I would therefore hold that the earlier version of § 2254 should apply throughout a habeas proceeding if the habeas court that issued a § 2251 stay took its preliminary look at the prospects for habeas success prior to AEDPA's effective date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      " I begin from what Boumediene identified as two “uncon-\n",
      "troversial” features of any habeas review: (1) the detainee\n",
      "must have “a meaningful opportunity to demonstrate that he\n",
      "is being held pursuant to ‘the erroneous application or inter-\n",

      "the course of an indefinite war—this “risk,” the opinion\n",
