SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
ARGUMENT
I. The Third Circuit's misguided application of
forum non conveniens shows that courts
lack clear guidance on the application of
this doctrine
A. Courts lack a clear framework to
evaluate evidence of corruption in foreign
courts, especially in the Latin American
context.
B. The Third Circuit disregarded a proven,
ongoing pattern of judicial corruption in
Peru
1. The justice sector is rife with quid pro
quo corruption
2. The lack of judicial independence is
acute when peasants and indigenous
peoples confront mining interests
II. Disregarding Peru's official recognition of
systemic
corruption
undermines
international comity and encourages
defendants' forum shopping
A. Certiorari should be granted to ensure
that comity is given to foreign-state
efforts to bolster the rule of law and fight
corruption
B. Certiorari
should
be
granted
to
discourage reverse forum shopping by
U.S.-incorporated entities and to ensure
effective regulation
