The Third Circuit also previously addressed this case at 765 F. App'x 811. The original district court decision is reported at 308 F. Supp. 3d 812.\n",
            "JURISDICTION The court of appeals issued its judgment on December 11, 2020, and denied a timely petition for rehearing on February 9, 2021. This petition is timely filed within 150 days of February 9, 2021. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1254(1).\n",
            "CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED There are no such provisions at issue here.\n",
            "INTRODUCTION No federal rule or statute creates or constrains the forum non conveniens (FNC) doctrine. It is a creature of judge-made, federal common law. But this Court has not addressed the applicable standards in the forty years since Piper, and it shows. Lacking guidance, the Circuits have adopted vague and conflicting rules. The FNC doctrine as currently applied ignores its original justification as a check on excessive assertions of jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. District courts exercise virtually standard-less discretion to dismiss meritorious claims.\n",
            "And the doctrine allows courts to abdicate jurisdiction Congress granted. See, e.g., Amy Coney Barrett, Procedural Common Law, 94 Va. L. Rev. 813, 826\n",
            " \f2 (2008) (â[F]orum non conveniens might be said to exist not only in the absence of enacted law on point but in spite of . . . jurisdiction and venue statutes that arguably instruct a district court to adjudicate.â); see also Peter B. Rutledge, With Apologies to Paxton Blair, 45 N.Y.U. J. Int'l L. & Pol. 1063, 1075 (2013) (arguing that the FNC doctrine empowers the courts to decline to exercise jurisdiction Congress authorized).\n",
            "Despite this Court's assumption that FNC dismissals would be rare, they are quite common, even where there are concerns about the foreign forum's adequacy, including rampant corruption. Indeed, lower courts refuse jurisdiction despite such doubts even when a U.S. defendant is sued in its home forum, which is presumptively fair and convenient and is the one clear place this Court has said a plaintiff is assured a fair shake.\n",
            "This case presents in stark relief the consequences of this doctrine run amok. The district court dismissed this case from Respondents' home forum, in spite of its continuing concerns about the adequacy and fairness of Respondents' preferred alternative forum â a jurisdiction in the throes of an unprecedented judicial corruption crisis, from which the very same Defendant had previously benefitted.\n",
            "There is disarray among the circuits over the standard for determining whether a foreign forum has been sufficiently proven to be adequate and fair. The Third Circuit's decision below deepened circuit conflicts over how the burden of proof is distributed and the standard a defendant must meet to prove an alternative forum is adequate. It held that defendants must merely âpersuadeâ the court of a âjustifiable\n",
            " \f3 beliefâ in an alternative forum's adequacy, even when defendants are sued in their own home forum and plaintiffs produce substantial evidence of the alternative forum's inadequacy. App. 7a-8a. The Third Circuit adopted the Eleventh Circuit's burden-shifting framework, which other circuits have rejected. And the Third Circuit declined to follow most circuits in requiring defendants to meet what amounts to a clear and convincing standard of proof, misinterpreting the Second Circuit's standard. Compare App. 7a-8a with Bank of Credit & Commerce Int'l (Overseas) Ltd. v.\n",
            "State Bank of Pak., 273 F.3d 241, 248 (2d Cir. 2001) (applying a higher standard of proof where dismissal conditions are insufficient).\n",
            "These multifarious and poorly articulated rules create significant uncertainty. The doctrine is supposed to ensure that the cases will not be sent to an unfair or inadequate forum. But the doctrine currently affords no such guarantee. Instead, the outcome often depends on where the case was filed.\n",
            "Indeed, a moving party may even have an easier time dismissing a case on forum non conveniens grounds than securing a domestic venue transfer under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1404, depending on where they are litigating.\n",
            "Petitioners challenge the adequacy of the Peruvian forum, presenting substantial and often uncontested evidence of widespread judicial corruption, including involving the same Respondent.\n",
            "The district court recognized âit cannot be questioned that Plaintiffs have satisfied their burdenâ in producing significant evidence calling the adequacy of the Peruvian forum into doubt. App. 38a. Yet the district court dismissed Petitioners' claims, holding\n",
            " \f4 that â[t]hough the events described are [] concerning, .\n",
            ". . Peru is an adequate alternative forum.â Id. at 18a.\n",
            "The Third Circuit affirmed. App. 3a-13a. Its Opinion conflicts with both the fundamental requirement that defendants establish the adequacy of the foreign forum, and this Court's guidance that defendants' burden is âheavy.â Its lowered standard of proof contradicts precedent from other Circuits. And it sent Petitioners off to litigate in a court system that itself has recognized it is in the midst of an unprecedented judicial corruption crisis. This approach would lead to divergent results in like cases and hollow out defendants' burden to demonstrate adequacy.\n",
            "The Opinion is also at odds with both the FNC doctrine's history â the doctrine did not allow dismissals from a defendant's home forum â and this Court's recent general personal jurisdiction jurisprudence, which contemplates a corporation's home forum as the one clear place a plaintiff is assured a fair day in court. A defendant sued in its home in a fair forum should not be granted a dismissal because it is purportedly more convenient to litigate in a questionable forum. Indeed, since that caselaw has substantially narrowed the availability of general jurisdiction, the FNC doctrine is less necessary to dismiss claims filed in forums inconvenient to Defendants or to police forum shopping.\n",
            "Given the increasing frequency of FNC motions, lower courts need to know how certain a district court must be that a plaintiff will receive a fair hearing in a fair court before dismissing. They need clear guidance on the allocation of the burden of proof and the\n",
            " \f5 applicable standard of proof defendants must meet to satisfy their burden. This case presents an ideal opportunity to address these questions. Certiorari is warranted to clarify this exceptionally important area of law.\n",
            "STATEMENT OF THE CASE 1. The forum non conveniens doctrine guarantees a fair, impartial forum. While it sometimes upends a litigant's choice of an inconvenient forum, it does so only if the alternative forum is adequate. âAt the outset of any forum non conveniens inquiry, the court must determine whether there exists an alternative forumâ that is adequate in order to guard against the âdanger that [plaintiffs] will be deprived of any remedy or treated unfairly.â Piper Aircraft, 454 U.S. at 254-55 & n. 22. Where the more convenient forum may not guarantee the litigants a fair, impartial, or otherwise adequate hearing, convenience yields to fairness, and the motion must be denied.\n",

And the decision below exacerbated this circuit split by joining the Second and Eleventh Circuits in combining a burdenshifting framework with a lower standard of proof.\n",
            "1. Five circuits took to heart this Court's guidance that defendants have a âheavy burdenâ because dismissal is a âharsh result.â Atl. Marine Constr. Co., 571 U.S. at 66 n.8 (internal quotations omitted). Three of these circuits specifically require the defendant to meet a heavy burden when showing the adequacy of the alternative forum. Adelson v.

In other contexts, this Court has recognized that a âheavy burdenâ approximates a clear and convincing standard. See generally, e.g., Schneiderman v.

Central Bank of Jordan, 75 F.3d 668, 677 (D.C. Cir. 1996), which means that defendants must âshow convincinglyâ and âaffirmatively proveâ its adequacy, Simon, 911 F.3d at 1184-85. These formulations match those that courts have developed in defining the clear and convincing standard in other contexts. 21B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 5122 nn. 96, 97 (2d ed. 2021 update) (collecting cases).\n",
            "2. The Second Circuit charts a middle path where âprecisely how certain the court must be regarding the existence of an adequate alternative foreign forum will necessarily depend on how protective of the nonmoving party the conditional dismissal will be.â Bank of Credit & Commerce Int'l (Overseas), 273 F.3d at 248.\n",
            "Thus, the Second Circuit finds a âjustifiable beliefâ sufficient where plaintiffs would be âfairly well protectedâ by court-imposed conditions on dismissal.\n",

R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 433 F.3d 1163, 1178-79 (9th Cir. 2006). The Sixth Circuit appears to take a similar approach. Jones, S.A., 920 F.3d at 1091 (affirming dismissal despite âlegitimate cause for concernâ about corruption). In practice, the Tenth Circuit applied the same test in Gschwind v. Cessna Aircraft Co., 161 F.3d 602, 606-07 (10th Cir. 1998), where defendants provided no initial evidence of adequacy and plaintiffs had the burden of proving inadequacy. These circuits essentially flip the burden to plaintiffs. But in cases like this one, where plaintiffs meet that high, misplaced burden, they are better off than Petitioners, because the inquiry ends.\n",

Lii, An Empirical Examination of the Adequate Alternative Forum in the Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens, 8 Rich. J. Global L. & Bus. 513, 522 (2009). Of these cases, the foreign forum was found adequate 82% of the time. Id. at 526. However, the likelihood a forum was found adequate varied notably between circuits (between 61-90% found adequate), such that âone would suspect the difference is caused by the differences in lawâ between the circuits. Id. at 528.\n",
            "Review is particularly important given the increasing frequency of FNC decisions. While the 14 years after Piper produced only 692 cases, the same search methodology applied to the past 14 years reveals 2131 forum non conveniens decisions.\n",

The disparate treatment of similarly situated parties, based on nothing more than the location of their lawsuit, is intolerable in a system intended to be governed by uniform rules.\n",

A corporate defendant is typically at home in both its principal place of business and its place of incorporation. Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 137 (2014). And those two homes are often in different circuits. Here, for example, the alternative forum was deemed adequate in the Third Circuit, Defendants' place of incorporation, but would have been deemed inadequate in the Tenth, Respondents' principal place of business.\n",

While Petitioners may find it â âdifficult to believe that Congress would' â preempt state law tort claims by consumers alleging injury from âFDA-approved devices . . . this is exactly what a pre-emption clause for medical devices does by its terms.â Riegel, 552 U.S. at 326 (majority opinion, quoting Ginsburg, J., dissenting). As the Riegel majority explained, the preemptive effect of the MDA was a congressional policy choice based on âsolicitude for those who would suffer without new medical devices if juries were allowed to apply the tort law of 50 States to all innovations.â Id. at 326. It is no surprise after Buckman and Riegel that plaintiffs have had difficulty bringing claims over PMA devices.

It is no surprise after Buckman and Riegel that plaintiffs have had difficulty bringing claims over PMA devices.

Smith & Nephew, Inc., No. 1:15-cv-00096-JNP-BCW, 2015 WL 7756063, at *2 (D. Utah 2015) (holding âthe difficulty of crafting a complaintâ sufficient to avoid preemption under âÂ§ 360k is not a proper legal basis for allowing a plaintiff to proceed to discovery,â but merely justified leave to amend). And although the issue was not raised or discussed, the claims in Buckman reached this Court on a motion to dismiss. See In re Orthopedic Bone Screw Liab. Litig., 159 F.3d 817, 818â19 (3d Cir.\n",

            " \f27 face of the complaint that the pleading is barred as a matter of law. Pet. 34; see also Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc., 784 F.3d 1335, 1341 (10th Cir. 2015) (Gorsuch, J.) (âa district court may grant judgment as a matter of law under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the basis of an affirmative defense like preemption when the law compels that resultâ); 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE Â§ 1357 (3d ed. 2004 & Supp. 2014) (collecting cases). Under Petitioners' own rule, then, preemption is an affirmative defense that can be raised in a motion to dismiss.\n",
            "A motion to dismiss based on preemption aligns with Petitioners' own rule because the fact that a Class III medical device went through PMA is not in dispute, and the fact that FDA granted PMA is subject to judicial notice. See supra n.2; see also Funk, 631 F.3d at 782 (affirming dismissal of inadequately supported manufacturing defect claim and holding district court appropriately took âjudicial notice, under Rule 12(b)(6), of the PMA the FDA grantedâ defendant to market device at issue). At that point, coupled with this Court's holding in Riegel, a medical device manufacturer does not need to establish any facts to prevail on preemption.\n",
            "Rather, it becomes incumbent upon the plaintiff to allege a violation of federal law that runs parallel to her state law claims. In other words, a plaintiff must provide factual support for her parallel claim to satisfy Rule 8(a)(2)'s requirement of â âa short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' in order to âgive the defendant fair notice of\n",

            "Petitioners cite no authority to the contrary. And a different rule would require the defendant to plead and prove affirmative compliance with a vast area of federal law (Caplinger noted âthe FDA's medical device regulations alone cover 592 pages of eight-point type,â 784 F.3d at 1342), which would run afoul of Twombly's instruction that the plaintiff must âprovide the âgrounds' of his âentitle[ment] to relief,' â Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).\n",
            "In short, there is nothing wrong with a ânationwide trendâ of dismissing claims against pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers âon a widespread basisâ when, as here, those claims fail to plead enough facts to identify a plausible parallel manufacturing defect in the product at issue.

            "Content: Beyond all this, this case is a poor vehicle for this Court to address an alleged circuit split over how to apply this Court's guidance on preemption in Buckman and Riegel to the narrow gap of possible state tort claims. The dismissal of Petitioners' failure to warn claims was affirmed not under Buckman, but under Twombly and Iqbal. Pet. App. 4.\n",
            "\f29 This case fares no better as a vehicle for addressing Petitioners' concerns with the dismissal of their manufacturing defect claims. As discussed above, Petitioners forfeited any argument that dismissal was âprematureâ because preemption is an affirmative defense, and their question presented does not encompass a challenge to the pleading standard applied below. See pp. 16â19, supra. So there is no issue on the dismissal of Petitioners' manufacturing defect claims that is properly before this Court.\n",
            "Petitioners' argument that this case is of national importance is thus hyperbole. Even on its own terms, the argument fails. Petitioners cite FDA's continuing regulatory action on breast implants, including FDA's recognition of a link between breast implants and a rare form of cancer not alleged here, but all this cite shows is that the federal regulatory system functions as Congress prescribed. Through pharmacovigilance involving FDA's Adverse Event Reporting System, FDA recognized an association between BIA-ALCL and breast implants. FDA is also actively monitoring reports of âbreast implant illness.â âCurrently, however, BII is not recognized as a formal medical diagnosis and there are no specific tests or recognized criteria to define or characterize it.â5\n",
